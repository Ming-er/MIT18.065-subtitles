好的，所以我要谈谈发送的渐变
ok so I'm gonna talk about gradient sent

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,414
今天要把它带到那个中心
today to get that to that central

11
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:36,345
神经网络深度学习算法
algorithm of neural nets deep learning

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,465
机器学习与优化
machine learning and optimization in

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,745
一般所以我想尽量减少一个
general so I'm trying to minimize a

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,655
功能，这就是你的方式，如果
function and that's the way you do it if

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,805
有很多变数太多了
there are many many variables too many

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,565
我们采取二阶导数
to take second derivatives then we

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,275
满足于的第一衍生物
settle for first derivatives of the

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,205
功能好，所以我介绍了你
function ok so I introduced and you've

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,995
已经满足渐变的想法，但让
already met the idea of gradient but let

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,394
我一定要发表一些意见
me just be sure to make some comments

21
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,065
关于渐变和Hessian和
about the gradient and the Hessian and

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,555
我们看到之前凸性的作用
the role of convexity before we see the

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,245
这是一个重要的例子，所以我有点儿
big a crucial example so I've kind of

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,794
为此至关重要的准备
prepared over here for this crucial

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,044
例如，该函数是纯二次的
example the function is a pure quadratic

26
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:30,375
-两个未知数X和y纯二次方
- two unknowns X and y pure quadratic so

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,945
我可以写的每一个纯二次方
every pure quadratic I can write in

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,395
在对称矩阵S和术语
terms of a symmetric matrix s and in

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,114
这种情况X1平方加BX2平方
this case X 1 squared plus BX 2 squared

30
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,915
矩阵的对称性仅为2x2
the symmetric the matrix is just 2x2 its

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,535
对角线它有我可以值1和B.
diagonal it's got I can values 1 and B

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,145
坐在对角线上，我在想
sitting on the diagonal I'm thinking of

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,355
B是较小的一个所以
B as being the smaller one so the

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,004
我们将看到的条件数是全部
condition number which we'll see is all

35
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,904
关于速度的重要性
important in question of the speed of

36
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:11,294
收敛是最大的比例
convergence is the ratio of the largest

37
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,115
到最小的
to the smallest

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,695
在这种情况下，最大的是一个
in this case the largest is one the

39
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,814
最小的为B所以这是一个在B和
smallest is B so that's one over B and

40
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,635
当那是一个超过B的人是一个大的时候
when that's a when one over B is a big

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,995
当B是一个非常小的数字时的数字
number when B is a very small number

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,965
然后那就是我们遇到麻烦的时候
then that's when we're in trouble there

43
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,715
条件号的矩阵提交时
condition number of a matrix submit when

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,935
矩阵是对称的条件
the matrix is symmetric that condition

45
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,564
如果是，则lambda最大值为λ最小值
number is lambda max over lambda min if

46
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,954
我有一个非对称矩阵我会
I had a unsymmetric matrix I would

47
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,594
可能使用Sigmamax而不是Sigmamin
probably use Sigma max over Sigma min of

48
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,395
当然，这里的矩阵是对称的
course but here matrices are symmetric

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,845
好吧，我们会看到一些整洁的东西
okay we're going to see something neat

50
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,745
是我们实际上可以采取的步骤
is that we can actually take the steps

51
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,075
最陡的血统写下每个人
of steepest descent write down what each

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,275
步骤给了我们，看看他们有多快
step gives us and see how quickly they

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,885
收敛到答案是什么
converge to the answer and what is the

54
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,305
回答所以Yminima我没有投入任何
answer so Y minima I haven't put in any

55
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,365
线性术语在这里，所以我只是有一个
linear term here so I'm I just have a

56
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,215
当然，公牛坐在原点上
bull sitting on the origin so of course

57
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,035
最小点是x等于0y等于
the minimum point is x equals 0 y equals

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,484
0所以最小点X星是00
0 so the minimum point X star is 0 0 of

59
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:25,145
课程
course

60
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,725
所以这个问题会有多快
so the question it will be how quickly

61
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,185
我们会去那个，你会说
do we get to that one and you'll say

62
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,935
非常小的例子不典型，但
pretty small example not typical but the

63
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,385
很棒的是我们看到了一切
terrific thing is that we see everything

64
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,925
对于这个例子我们可以看到实际的
for this example we can see the actual

65
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,984
我们可以看到最陡峭的下降步骤
steps of steepest descent we can see how

66
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,854
很快他们就会聚集到x星了
quickly they converge to the x star the

67
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,755
回答他们被视为一个地方的地方
answer the place where they're seen as a

68
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,895
最小，我们可以开始思考什么
minimum and we can begin to think what

69
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,954
要做的话，如果太慢那么好，我会来的
to do if it's too slow okay so I'll come

70
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,715
我会回到那个例子之后
back I'll come to that example after

71
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,035
关于渐变的一些一般想法
some general thoughts about gradients

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,134
Hessians所以渐变告诉了什么
Hessians so what does the gradient tell

73
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,435
我们这么让我走的一个例子
us so let me just take an example of the

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,734
梯度
gradient

75
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,075
现在让我采取线性函数f
now let me take a linear function f of

76
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:27,245
XY等于说2x加5y我想我们
XY equals say 2x plus 5y I just think we

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,075
应该完全熟悉这些
ought to get totally familiar with these

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,085
我们正在做一些你知道的事情
we're doing something you know we're

79
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,945
当我进入一个重要的话题
jumping into an important topic when I

80
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,085
问你是什么梯度
ask you what's the gradient that's a

81
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,885
新生问题但是我们就是这样
freshman question but let's just

82
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,855
记住我们知道如何解释
remember we know how to interpret the

83
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,785
渐变如何计算它意味着什么
gradient how to compute it what it means

84
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,215
它如何在几何看到它如此
what it how to see it geometrically so

85
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,315
什么是该功能的梯度
what's the gradient of that function

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,595
这两个变量的函数，所以
it's a function of two variables so the

87
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,355
渐变是具有两个分量的向量
gradient is a vector with two components

88
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,675
他们是尊重的衍生物
and they are the derivative with respect

89
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,435
到X是2，导数是
to X which is 2 and the derivative is

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,735
矢量Y是5，所以在这种情况下
vector Y which is 5 so that in this case

91
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,505
渐变是恒定的和Hessian
the gradient is constant and the Hessian

92
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,855
我经常在Hessian之后称之为H
which I often call H after Hessian or

93
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,165
delsquaredF会告诉我们我们正在服用
del squared F would tell us we're taking

94
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,155
将成为第二衍生品
second derivatives that will be the

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,225
二阶导数显然为零
second derivatives obviously zero in

96
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,855
这种情况那么H的形状是什么
this case so what what what shape is H

97
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,055
每个人都是2比2
here it's 2 by 2 right everybody

98
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,875
承认2比2这个H会有我
recognizes 2 by 2 this H would have I

99
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,625
采取那个抱歉的二阶导数
take the second derivative of that sorry

100
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,095
与之相关的第一个衍生物
the first derivative of that with

101
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,735
尊重X显然是第一个零
respect to X obviously zero the first

102
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,375
衍生出对Y的尊重第一
derivative the respect to Y the first

103
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,275
关于XY的衍生物
derivative of that with respect to X Y

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:08,195
OKOK零所以让我画的表面，从而
ok zero ok so let me draw the surface so

105
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,275
XY和表面，如果我在此图f
X Y and the surface if i graph f in this

106
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,845
方向那么显然我有一架飞机
direction then obviously I have a plane

107
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,775
而我在飞机上的一个典型点
and I'm at a typical point on the plane

108
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,925
让我们说是的，所以我在X点
let's say yeah yeah so I'm at a point X

109
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,414
我应该说我在XY和
Y I should say I'm at a point X Y and

110
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,265
让我把飞机穿过它好吧
let me put the plane through it ok so

111
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,765
我怎么解释
how do I interpret the

112
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,215
在那个特定点XY什么是2x
at that particular point XY what does 2x

113
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,305
加上5y告诉我或者什么是什么
plus 5y tell me or what does rather what

114
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,805
免费提供
does gratis

115
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:48,325
告诉我从那一点开始的运动
tell me about movement from that point

116
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,295
XY当然是渐变常数所以它
XY of course the gradient constant so it

117
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,305
真的没关系我是什么意思
really didn't matter what point I'm

118
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,814
移动但服用点这里这么
moving from but taking a point here so

119
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:58,805
这是怎么回事
what's the deal

120
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,435
如果我搬到什么走的最快方法
if I move what's the fastest way to go

121
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,245
如果我乘坐那架飞机就可以了
up the surface if I took the plane that

122
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,485
经历了那一点XY是什么
went through that point XY what's the

123
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,404
攀登飞机的最快方式是什么
fastest way to climb the plane what's

124
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:14,765
什么方向最快他们的
the what direction goes up fastest their

125
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,775
渐变方向对齐渐变
gradient direction right the gradient

126
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,474
方向是我如何前进的方向
direction is the way up how am I going

127
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,164
把它放在这张照片中我猜我是
to put that in this picture I guess I'm

128
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,305
想到这架飞机就像飞机一样
thinking of this plane as so what plane

129
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,254
你能不能问我的飞机
you could it well ask what plane of I'd

130
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:33,034
我假设我画了2x的飞机
drawn suppose I've drawn the plane 2x

131
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:40,284
加上5Y等于等于零，所以我会做
plus 5y equal equal zero so I'll make

132
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,175
好吧，我已经采取了一个典型的观点
okay and I've taken a typical point on

133
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,365
如果我愿意的话，那架飞机现在可以
that plane okay now if I want to

134
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,714
增加我去的功能
increase that function I go

135
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,895
如果我，垂直于飞机
perpendicular to the plane right if I

136
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,024
想要保持与我的功能水平
want to stay level with the function I

137
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,085
希望它留在零我留在
want it to stay at zero I stay in the

138
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,515
飞机所以有两个关键方向
plane so there are two key directions

139
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,524
大家都知道，我只是在重复
everybody knows this I'm just repeating

140
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,254
这是梯度的方向
this is the direction of the gradient of

141
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:10,325
˚F离开平面的最陡的向上此
f out of the plane steepest upwards this

142
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,545
是向下的方向减去
is the downwards direction minus

143
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,325
F垂直平面的梯度
gradient of F perpendicular plane

144
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,295
向下，这就是那条线
downwards and this is the that line is

145
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,254
在飞机中，它是水平仪的一部分
in the plane that's part of a level set

146
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,075
2个加5Y等于零将是一个级别
2x plus 5y equals zero would be a level

147
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,235
设置好，这是我非常业余的
set okay that's my pretty amateur

148
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,375
图片就是我想要记住的全部内容
picture just all I want to remember is

149
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,895
这些话水平
these words level

150
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:50,395
陡峭的上升或下降是一个减号
and steepest up or down down was a minus

151
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,445
我们以最陡的血统看到的标志
sign that we see in in steepest descent

152
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:03,295
所以我们处于最陡峭的上升状态
so we're in steepest ascent okay and and

153
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,425
什么是黑森州告诉我的
what's the Hessian telling me about the

154
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,315
表面如果我采用矩阵的话
surface what if I take the matrix of

155
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,135
二阶衍生物哦是的所以我有
second derivatives oh yeah so I have

156
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,725
这个表面让我的表面F相等
this surface so I have a surface F equal

157
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:23,935
常数就是那种水平
constant that's the sort of level

158
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,075
表面如果我留在那个表面那么
surface so if I stay in that surface the

159
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,855
F的梯度为0，F的梯度为0
gradient of F is 0 gradient of F is 0

160
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,365
并且在进来的先生是一个
and in in in in on on the sir on is a

161
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,155
更好的表面上的渐变词
better word on the surface the gradient

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,915
F点垂直，但是什么
of F points perpendicular but what does

163
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,985
关于赫斯顿怎么办？
the what what does what about the Heston

164
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,585
的二阶导数那是什么
the second derivative what is that

165
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,685
告诉我
telling me about

166
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,815
那个表面特别是当
that surface in particular when the

167
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,355
Hessian是零或其他表面的东西
Hessian is zero or other surfaces what

168
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,035
Hessian告诉我它的说法
does the Hessian tell me about it says

169
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,565
我在考虑一下Hessian
I'm thinking of the Hessian at a

170
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,095
特别的一点，所以我得到了
particular point so I get I'm getting

171
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,465
对于黑森州来说是零因为表面
zero for the Hessian because the surface

172
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:31,575
如果表面是凸的，则是平的
is flat if the surface was convex

173
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:38,055
向上，如果它是一个凸图
upwards from if it was a convex graph of

174
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:46,935
如果我只是Hessian那么
F the Hessian would be so what so I just

175
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,005
我想现在就建立这样的联系
want to make that connection now what's

176
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,905
Hessian与Hessian之间的联系
the connection between the Hessian and

177
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,685
Hessian的父亲的凸性
convexity of the father the Hessian of

178
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,954
的功能和凸性
the function and convexity of the

179
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,295
功能是什么所以关键在于
function what so the point is that's the

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,155
是的那个凸起的Hessian
yeah that convexity the the Hessian

181
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,615
告诉我，表面是否是
tells me whether or not the surface is

182
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,515
凸和什么是测试正面
convex and what is the test positive

183
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,015
明确或半确定我只是
definiteness or semi definite I'm just

184
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,745
寻找借口写下来
looking for an excuse to write down

185
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:27,315
我说是凸性和强烈的限制
convexity and strong restrict do I say

186
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,255
我忘记了更严格的强烈凸度
stricter strong convexity I forgotten

187
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:37,145
严格我认为严格凸
strict I think strictly convex

188
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,475
好吧，这是Hessian的凸性
okay so convexity the Hessian is

189
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,334
正半正定或包括
positive semi-definite or which includes

190
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,545
我最好在这里说
which I better say that right here

191
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:56,085
包括肯定的
includes positive definite

192
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,275
如果我只是在寻找一个
and if I'm only if I'm looking for a

193
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,495
严格的凸性然后我必须要求
strict convexity then I must require

194
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,845
肯定的
positive definite

195
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:10,555
H是正定半定
H is positive definite semi definite

196
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,115
不会这样做半定的凸
won't do so so semi definite for convex

197
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,445
所以实际上是线性函数
so that in fact the the linear function

198
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,655
是凸的但不严格凸
is convex but not strictly convex

199
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,445
严格意味着它真的向上弯曲
strictly means it really bends upwards

200
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,025
黑森州是肯定的
the Hessian is positive definite that

201
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,315
曲率是正的所以这样
curvatures are positive so so that this

202
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,915
这将包括线性函数和
this would include linear functions and

203
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,985
那不包括线性函数
that would not include linear function

204
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,915
他们不是严格凸出好的
they're not strictly convex okay good

205
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,175
好的好一些例子好的号码
good good some examples okay the number

206
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,155
当然，我们就是一个例子
one example of course is the one we're

207
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,955
在这里谈论
talking about over here

208
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:58,795
所以X的例子f等于一半x
so examples f of X equal one half x

209
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,105
转置X，当然我可以
transpose X and of course I could have

210
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,875
线性项减去aa转置Xa
linear terms minus a a transpose X a

211
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,015
线性项，我可以有我们的概念
linear term and I could have our concept

212
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:21,505
好吧所以这个功能是严格的
okay so so this function is strictly

213
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,075
当这是肯定的时候是凸的
convex when this is positive definite

214
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,355
因为HsH现在是F的
because H s H is now F for this for that

215
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,355
该函数的函数H通常为H.
function for that function H usually H

216
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,335
Hessian矩阵从点变化到
the Hessian is varying from point to

217
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,615
指出纯粹的好事
point the nice thing about the pure

218
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,315
二次方是不变它是一样的
quadratic is it's constant it's the same

219
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,735
在所有点上好吧让我问你
s at all points okay let me just ask you

220
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,965
这是一个凸函数，是什么
so that's a convex function and what's

221
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,715
它的最小值是渐变的最小值
its minimum what's the gradient first of

222
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,814
所有赌注都是颗粒状的
all what's the grainy in the bet

223
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:08,004
我真的要求区分
I'm asking really for differentiating

224
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:11,935
思考Victini和矢量做所有n
thinking Victini and Vector doing all n

225
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,944
我在问这个衍生品
derivatives that at once here I'm asking

226
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,865
对于整个矢量的第一个
for the whole vector of first

227
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,944
衍生品，因为我在这里给予
derivatives and because here I'm giving

228
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:26,285
你用X的整个功能
you the whole function in with X for a

229
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,975
矢量X当然我们可以采取n
vector X of course we could take n to be

230
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,305
1然后我们会看到如果n是1
1 and then we would see that if n was 1

231
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,725
这只是XX平方x平方
this would just be X X squares x squared

232
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,295
1/21/2sx平方和衍生物
1/2 1/2 s x squared and the derivative

233
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,004
1/2ikSX平方让我刚才放
of 1/2 ik SX squared let me just put

234
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,624
在这里，所以我们一定会得到它
that over here so we're sure to get it

235
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,295
右侧的sx平方这是在
right half of s x squared this is in the

236
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,475
n等于一个案例，衍生物是
n equal one case and the derivative is

237
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,084
显然sx，这就是它在这里
obviously sx and that's what it is here

238
00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:06,605
sx它真的只是你知道它
sx it really just you know it's

239
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,475
显然很简单，但如果你没有
obviously simple but if you haven't

240
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,675
想到了它要求的那条线
thought about that line it's asking for

241
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,824
所有的第一衍生品都是一部分
all the part all the first derivatives

242
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:20,764
那个二次函数哦
of that of that quadratic function oh

243
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:24,785
这不是什么，如果我如果我做什么我
it's not what if I what if I what do I

244
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,934
现在必须包括我不是那个
have to include now here I didn't that's

245
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,245
不正确，因为它代表功能
not right as it stands for the function

246
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,155
在上面写的是什么是正确的
that's written above it what's the right

247
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,915
渐变-感谢因为线性
gradient - a thanks because the linear

248
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,405
功能它的偏导数
function it's partial derivatives that

249
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,415
显然只是一个组成部分
are obviously just the components of a

250
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:52,804
好吧，HessianH就是了
ok and the Hessian H is s the

251
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,125
那家伙的衍生物确实不错
derivatives of that guy ok good good

252
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,865
我们可能的良好和最低价值
good good and minimum value we might as

253
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,535
还有哦，是什么是话语权
well oh yeah what's the right words for

254
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,634
最小值，不，我很抱歉
a minimum value the no I'm sorry the

255
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,575
正确的词有像男人一样的最低价值
right word has minimum value like f men

256
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,615
所以我想先计算好FMN
so I want to compute FMN well first I

257
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,045
要搞清楚哪里哪里是
have to figure out where where is that

258
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,915
达到的最小值和答案是什么
minimum reached and what's the answer to

259
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,585
那就是我们正在放的
that so that's just we're putting

260
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,105
一切都在黑板上这个简单
everything on the board for this simple

261
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:38,405
case的最小f为f的f
case the minimum of f of f of f of X

262
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,535
记住它的X是我们的n维度
remember it's X's we're in n dimensions

263
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:50,895
在X等于最小值
is at X equal what well the minimum is

264
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,505
渐变为零的地方就是这样的
where the gradient is zero so what's the

265
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,425
最小化Xs逆转谢谢
minimizing X s inverse a thanks

266
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:11,525
什么是抱歉，这是不对的
and what's the sorry that's not right

267
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,245
在这里，我打算写它
it's here that I meant to write it I

268
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,095
对我来说，这并不是我的全部观点
didn't really my whole point for this

269
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,975
小小的一刻是要确保我们保持
little moment is to be sure that we keep

270
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,725
直接我所说的地方
straight what I mean by the place where

271
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,635
达到最小值并达到最小值
the minimum is reached and the minimum

272
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,545
这些是两件不同的东西
value those are two different things

273
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,165
好的，所以在s达到最小值
okay so the minimum is reached at s

274
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,565
逆a因为那显然在哪里
inverse a because that's obviously where

275
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,325
梯度为零，这是一个解决方案
the gradient is zero it's a solution to

276
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,775
sX等于a和我要问的内容
s X equal a and what I was going to ask

277
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,995
你是正确的单词
you is what's the right word well sort

278
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,855
为了for而向上划伤的单词
of words scratch-made upward for the for

279
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,615
这一点X星的最小值是
this point X star where the minimum is

280
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,045
达到，所以它不是最小值
reached so it's not the minimum value

281
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,845
这是它到达的地步
it's the point where it's reached and

282
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,395
这就是所谓的为符号
that's called the notation for that

283
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,585
点是arghmen感谢argh
point is argh men Thanks argh

284
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,625
我的功能的分钟，这意味着
mins of my function and that means the

285
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:24,315
这就是F等于F的点
place that's the point where F equals F

286
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,465
分
min

287
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,815
我还没有说最低限度的是什么
I haven't said yet what the minimum

288
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,884
价值是这告诉我们的要点和
value is this tells us the point and

289
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:33,644
这通常是我们感兴趣的
that's usually what we're interested in

290
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:36,044
在哪里说实话不是
where to tell the truth not that

291
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,995
感兴趣的一个典型的例子，
interested in a typical example that

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,995
最小值是多少
what the minimum value is as much as

293
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,534
我们在哪里达到那个目的
where is it where do we reach that thing

294
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:50,874
当然所以这就是x-men
and of course so this is x-men this is

295
00:18:50,879 --> 00:19:00,085
然后是我的功能的男人，如果那样的话
then are men of my function if that's

296
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,695
关键在于它恰好在此
the point and it happens to be in this

297
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,384
case最小值实际为零
case the minimum value is actually zero

298
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:11,365
所以它是因为它因为没有
so it goes because it because there's no

299
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,914
因为没有线性没有线性项
because there's no linear no linear term

300
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,374
aa转置一个好的我猜我觉得
a a transpose a okay III guess I feel

301
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:23,124
我为什么要谈
why am I talking about

302
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,544
武装人员，当你们都看到它三
armed men when you've all seen it III

303
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,945
我猜我觉得有人可以
guess I think that somebody could just

304
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,674
正在阅读这些东西
be reading this stuff for example

305
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,325
学习神经网络并进入
learning about neural nets and run into

306
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,095
这个表达论点和思考
this expression argument and think

307
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,924
这是什么，所以它可能是一个权利
what's that so it's it's maybe a right

308
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,264
到时候再说吧就是它的点
time to say what it is it's the point

309
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,424
达到最低值的地方就是这样
where the minimum is reached and that's

310
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,534
这就是为什么那些话为什么呢
it's the why that why those words by the

311
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:54,865
办法
way

312
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,355
以及哎呀不是太大的话那
well argh isn't much of a word that

313
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,154
听起来你被勒死了但是
sounds like you're getting strangled but

314
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,144
它有点短
it's sort of short

315
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:06,475
我认为它的短从来没有人告诉我
I assume it's short nobody ever told me

316
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,284
我认为这是争论的缩写
this I assume it's short for argument

317
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:12,355
单词论证是一种长话
the word argument is a kind of long word

318
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,894
对于x的值，如果我有一个函数
for the value of x if I have a function

319
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,134
fF的XFI调用函数，X是
f of X F I call a function and X is the

320
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:24,325
您可能经常使用的函数的参数
argument of the function you might often

321
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,914
更经常看到变量这个词，但是
more often see the word variable but but

322
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,235
争论，我假设那是什么
argument and I'm assuming that's what

323
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,715
指的是那个论点
that refers to is the argument that

324
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,504
最小化功能好的和
minimizes the function okay good and and

325
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:38,294
和
and

326
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,744
在这里它现在是反过来但只是通过
here it is s inverse a now but just by

327
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:43,754
什么是F男人你知道吗？
the way what is F men do you know the

328
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,214
最小的二次方我的意思是
minimum of a quadratic I mean this is

329
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:49,874
根本最小化问题
the fundamental minimization question to

330
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:53,144
最小化二次电
minimize a quadratic electrical

331
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,575
设计二次调节器
engineering the quadratic regulator

332
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,914
问题是最简单的问题
problem is the simplest problem there

333
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,435
可能有限制，我们会看到
there could be constraints and we'll see

334
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,374
它包含约束但是正确
it with constraints included but right

335
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:06,315
现在我们没有任何限制
now no constraints at all we're just

336
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,744
看着X和我们的函数f
looking at the function f of X and we

337
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:14,464
让我删除B，因为那只是
let me remove the B because that's just

338
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:19,424
如果我删除它，则将函数移位B.
shifts a function by B if I erase that

339
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:22,244
这只是说这并不重要，它的
that's just to say it didn't matter it's

340
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,304
这真的是功能，使
it's really that function so that

341
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,014
功能实际上是零
function actually goes through zero

342
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,584
正确的是，当X为零时，我们
right as it is when X is zero we

343
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,644
显然是零，但它仍然在它
obviously get zero but it's still on its

344
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:36,644
下来，所以说它正在路上
way down so to speak it's on its way

345
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:40,244
到目前为止，反过来了
down to this point s inverse a that's

346
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:43,244
它最低点和最低点
where it bottoms out and when it bottoms

347
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:47,445
你有什么东西我得到的一件事我
out what do you get for F one thing I

348
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,815
知道这会是消极的，因为
know it's going to be negative because

349
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,824
它通过了零，它就在它的上面
it passed through zero and it was on its

350
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:54,794
低于零的方式所以让我们弄清楚
way below zero so let's just figure out

351
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,264
Fmin是什么，所以我有一半是的
what that F min is so I have a half yeah

352
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:04,364
我只是插入反向的
I'm just gonna plug in s inverse a the

353
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:06,824
底部点进入功能并看到
bottom point into the function and see

354
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,935
什么是表面的地方
what's the what's where the surface

355
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,204
最底层，以及什么在什么
bottoms out and and what at what at what

356
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,354
它最低点，所以我有一半
level it bottoms out so I have a half so

357
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,584
这是一个转换s
that's s inverse a is a transpose s

358
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,764
反s是对称的，所以我只是
inverse s is symmetric so I'll just

359
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:29,264
只写逆转置ss逆
write just inverse transpose s s inverse

360
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:34,984
a从二次项减去a
a from the quadratic term minus a

361
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:40,185
转置和X是反向的
transpose and X is s inverse a have

362
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,614
你已经完成了这个计算
you've done this calculation if you it

363
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:46,214
只是没有伤害重复它好吧
just doesn't hurt to repeat it okay so

364
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:50,285
我登录了s逆a
I've logged in s inverse a

365
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,304
在那里，那里有什么我
there there and there okay what have I

366
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:54,785
拿到
got

367
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,595
好s反取消s所以我有一个
well s inverse cancels s so I have a

368
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,865
转置的一半与-1相反
half of a transpose s inverse a minus 1

369
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,775
我得到的转置反转a
of a transpose inverse a so I get

370
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,695
最后是负1/2的一半-1
finally negative 1/2 half of it - 1 of

371
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:16,085
它的转置是对不起的
it of a transpose s inverse a sorry

372
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,905
那不是很好用的
that's not brilliant use of the

373
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,885
黑板挤在那里但是
blackboard to squeeze that in there but

374
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:28,235
这很容易重复，好吧
that's that's easily repeatable ok good

375
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,164
所以这是一个二次碗a
so that's what a quadratic bowl a

376
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:36,174
完美的二次问题最小化到
perfect quadratic problem minimizes to

377
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,835
哪个是最低级别我可以
where that's its lowest level ok I

378
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,605
想提一个其他功能
wanted to mention one other function

379
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,895
因为我主要讲的是
because I'm going to speak mostly about

380
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,525
二次但显然是整点
quadratic but obviously the whole point

381
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,155
这是真正的凸性
is that it's the convexity that's really

382
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,054
让事情变得如此有效我在这里让我
making things work so so here I let me

383
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:06,605
只是放在这里一个非凡的凸
just put here a remarkable convex

384
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:17,975
功能和笔记告诉那是什么
function and the notes tell what is that

385
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,655
什么是这个函数的梯度
what's the gradient of this function

386
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,205
他们实际上并没有走得那么远
they don't actually go as far as the

387
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,155
黑森州证明这是一个罪犯
Hessian proving this as a convict

388
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,195
证明这个功能我要去
proving that this function I'm going to

389
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,785
写下来是一个凸起的凸起吧
write down is a convex is convex it

390
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,914
需要一点点的思想，但它是它的
takes a little thinking but it's a it's

391
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,395
一个你永远不会有的奇妙功能
a fantastic function you would never

392
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,725
排序的想象，如果你没有没
sort of imagine it if you didn't didn't

393
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,125
有时看到它所以我会这样
see it sometimes so I'm it's going to be

394
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,765
矩阵的一个函数
a function of a matrix a function of

395
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:57,785
那些是N平方变量XIJ
those are N squared variables X IJ

396
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,585
所以它是许多变量和函数的函数
so it's a function of many variables and

397
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,275
这是这个功能你拿走了
here's this function it's you take the

398
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,755
明确的矩阵的决定因素
determinant of the matrix that's clearly

399
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,675
所有N平方的函数
a function of all the N squared

400
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,935
变量然后你取日志
variables then you take the log of the

401
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,505
决定因素并加上减号
determinant and put in a minus sign

402
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:22,305
因为我们想要凸起的那个转动
because we want convex that that turns

403
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,365
是一个凸函数甚至是
out to be a convex function and even to

404
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,495
只需检查两个两个
just check that for two by two

405
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,775
两个两个你有四个
well for two by two you have four

406
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,455
变量，因为它是两个两个
variables because it's a two by two

407
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,885
矩阵，我们也许可以检查它的
matrix we could maybe check it for a

408
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,195
对称矩阵我向下移动到三个
symmetric matrix I move down to three

409
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,545
变量，但我会很高兴任何人
variables but it's I'd be glad anybody

410
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:46,365
谁也有雄心壮志，不知道为什么要登录
who's ambitious too to see why that log

411
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,245
行列式是一个非凡的功能
determinant is is a remarkable function

412
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:55,145
让我看看我认为我认为它是
and let me see I think I I think it is

413
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,405
使得散热器的梯度也
so the gradient of that sink is also

414
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,105
该功能我的惊人的梯度
amazing the gradient of that function I

415
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,445
意思是我有一个高峰，所以我不写
mean I've got a peak so I don't write a

416
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:16,535
这是对的错误事实，所以
right to wrong fact here yep so the

417
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,725
该函数的偏导数是
partial derivatives of that function are

418
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,345
这些条目是项
the entries of these are the entries of

419
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,385
一个逆
of a inverse

420
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:36,865
那就是X逆
that's the of X inverse

421
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,295
是的，那就像哇那样做了
yeah that that's like wow where did that

422
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,975
来自好吧
come from okay

423
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,055
它可能是-当然是条目是的
it might be - the entries of course yeah

424
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:52,295
是的，所以我们有N平方功能
yeah so we've got N squared function so

425
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,065
想想那是什么典型的
think of the well what is a typical

426
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,915
进入X逆是什么的
entry in in X inverse what is the

427
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:03,425
典型的X逆IJ只是要记住
typical X inverse IJ just to remember

428
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,235
那一点非常老式的线性
that bit of pretty old-fashioned linear

429
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,745
代数反转的条目
algebra the entries of the inverse

430
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,555
矩阵
matrix

431
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,065
我敢肯定-除以什么
I'm sure - divided by what the

432
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,185
确定这是我们所知道的一件事
determinate that's the one thing we know

433
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,555
这就是我们记录日志的原因
and that's the reason we take the log

434
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,465
因为当你采取一个衍生物
because when you take derivatives of a

435
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,095
记录你将确定X的内容
log you that will put determine of X in

436
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,105
分母然后是分子
the denominator and then the numerator

437
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,115
将是的衍生物
will be the derivatives of the

438
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,575
决定性的X哦
determinant of X Oh

439
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,555
我们可以得到任何想法还有的
can we get any idea what there are the

440
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,885
我的决定因素的衍生物哦
derivatives of the determinants oh my

441
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:46,145
天啊好的
god okay

442
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,705
所以，到目前为止，你和我在一起
so you with me so far this is gonna be

443
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,935
决定因素的衍生物
derivatives of determinants respect of

444
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,205
所有这些变量由分割
all these variables divided by the

445
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,935
决定因素，因为这是日志
determinant because that's what the log

446
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,855
当我拿走时，这是正确的
achieved right so when I take the

447
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,655
事物日志的衍生物
derivative of the log of something the

448
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,175
连锁规则说采取衍生物
chain rule says take the derivative of

449
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,445
因为那个东西除了
that since of that something divided by

450
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,195
行列式向量除以
determinant vector divided by the

451
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,595
X的功能决定因素那么什么
function determinant of X okay so what

452
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,965
什么是决定因素的衍生物
what's the derivative of the determinant

453
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,965
矩阵相对于它的一个
of a matrix with respect to its one one

454
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,905
进入是肯定这是疯了但是
entry yes sure this is this is crazy but

455
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,825
它的疯狂到做这一点，但它的
it's crazy to be doing this but it's

456
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,435
健康还好
healthy okay so

457
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,865
好的，所以我有一个矩阵XDeltaXX11
okay so I have a matrix X Delta X X 1 1

458
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:45,644
X1n所以2xn1xnnok，我是什么
X 1 n so 2 xn 1 xn n ok and what am I

459
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:48,164
寻找我在寻找，对于
looking for I'm looking for that for the

460
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,754
我想要的那些衍生物
derivatives of that do I want the

461
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:57,674
决定因素是这样的衍生物
derivatives of the determinants yes so

462
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,544
什么是X的衍生物
what's the derivative of X of the

463
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:08,585
关于他们的第一个决定因素
determinant with respect to their first

464
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:15,404
等于我怎么能弄明白我是不是
equals what how can I figure out if I

465
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,384
改变所以这就要求我这样做
change so what's this asking me to do

466
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,475
它要我用Delta改变X11
it's asking me to change X 1 1 by Delta

467
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,475
X，看看有什么变化
X and see what's the change in the

468
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,544
决定性的权利是决定的
determinant right that's what determines

469
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:29,205
这就是衍生品的变化X11
that's what derivatives are change X 1 1

470
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,544
一点点的多少做多少钱
a little bit how much did how much did

471
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:35,115
决定性的变化和看到的方式
the determinant change and what see how

472
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,205
做什么有决定因素
do i what what has the determinant of

473
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,065
整个矩阵与X11有关
the whole matrix got to do with X 1 1

474
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,804
你还记得，有一个公式
you remember that there's a formula for

475
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,215
决定因素所以我需要这个事实
determinants so I need that fact the

476
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,924
X的行列式是X11次
determinant of X is X 1 1 times

477
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,874
事情就是这样
something and it's that it's that

478
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,435
我真想知道的事情
something that I really want to know

479
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,095
加上X1/2倍的其他东西加
plus X 1/2 times others something plus

480
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,725
加上第一排的时间
plus say along the first row times

481
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:12,284
另外一件事是什么因素
another something what are these factors

482
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:18,644
即乘以XS给予
that multiply the XS to give the

483
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:21,735
决定因素给出的是线性的
determinant what that gives is a linear

484
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,014
第一行时间的组合
combination of the first row times

485
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:26,835
某些因素给出了决定因素
certain factors gives the determinant

486
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,784
和我怎么知道会有
and how do I know that there will be

487
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,784
因为这些因素的根本
such factors because the fundamental

488
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,705
决定因素的属性就是它
property of the determinant is that it's

489
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,605
在第1行线性的，如果我不乱用
linear in Row 1 if I don't mess with

490
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,695
其他行是Rho的线性函数
other rows it's a linear function of Rho

491
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,174
Rho1所以它是如何
of Rho 1 so it is how

492
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,874
形式X11次和什么
the form X 1 1 times something and what

493
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:51,195
这是决定因素的东西
is that something the determinant of the

494
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,435
这就是X11乘以的时候
of this so what is X 1 1 multiply when

495
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,554
你计算决定因素X11不会
you compute determinants X 1 1 will not

496
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,504
在其行中乘以任何其他人
multiply any other guys in its row

497
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:01,815
因为从来没有你永远不会
because you never you never are

498
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,394
在同一行中乘以2个X.
multiplying 2 X's in the same same row

499
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,274
X11是同一列
or the same column what X 1 1 is

500
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,965
事实上，所有这些人都成倍增加
multiplying are all these guys in fact

501
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,524
事实证明这是决定因素
it turns out to be it's the determinant

502
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:15,975
所以这就是这样，这叫做什么
so this is so and what is this called

503
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,965
那是我的一个较小的决定因素
that that one smaller determinant that I

504
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,225
扔掉第一排和
get by throwing away the first row and

505
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,494
它被称为第一列
first column it's called

506
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:29,985
当一个未成年人好的时候，未成年人是好的
when one minor is good yes minor is good

507
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,595
我说有两个字
I was saying there are two words that

508
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:43,274
可以使用次要和辅助因素是和
can be used minor and cofactor yeah and

509
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,735
这是什么意思我如何计算它
what is it I mean how do i compute it

510
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,685
没有什么，这是一个数量
wasn't what is the number this is a

511
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,674
号和它的那就是它只是一个
number and it's it's that it's just a

512
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,914
数字，但我想到的可能是什么
number but what maybe I think of the

513
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,065
我觉得这个决定因素很小
minor as this determinant maybe I think

514
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,585
作为这个较小的矩阵和未成年人
of the minor as this smaller matrix and

515
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,914
辅助因子是决定因素
the cofactor which is the determinant of

516
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,845
未成年人，有一个加号或减号
the minor and there's a plus or minus

517
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,274
关于决定因素的一切都有
everything about determinants there's a

518
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,485
有一个加号或减号的选择
there's a there's a plus or minus choice

519
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,335
要做，我们不会不去
to be made and we won't we're not going

520
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,014
担心这一点
to worry about that

521
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:33,465
但无论如何，所以它是我的辅助因素
but so anyway so so it's the cofactor I

522
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:38,804
意味着太阳能称它为c11，所以那就是
mean solar call it c11 and and so that's

523
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,644
决定因素的公式
the formula for the determinant

524
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:45,705
这是一个辅助因子扩张
that's the cofactor expansion of a

525
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:53,595
行列式
determinant

526
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,165
好的，这将连接到这个
okay and that will connect back to this

527
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,405
惊人的事实是，梯度是
amazing fact that the gradient is the

528
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,655
X逆的条目因为逆
entries of X inverse because the inverse

529
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,735
是辅因子的比例来决定的
is the ratio of cofactor to determine so

530
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,665
X逆11是那个辅助因子
X inverse 1 1 is that cofactor over the

531
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:23,685
行列式所以这就是反正这个地方
determinant so that's where this anyway

532
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:30,025
我只是提到这一点
I'm just mentioning that as a as a very

533
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:35,115
凸函数的有趣例子
interesting example of a convex function

534
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,155
好的，我会留下那只是为了喜欢
ok I'll leave that that's just for like

535
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,875
教育好现在我准备去上班了
education ok now I'm ready to go to work

536
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,075
在梯度下降所以实际上
on on gradient descent so so actually

537
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,174
本课程的其余部分和周五的
the rest of this class and Friday's

538
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,054
关于梯度下降的课程非常
class about gradient descent are very

539
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,865
1806年的基本部分
fundamental parts of this of the of 1806

540
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,225
5这将是我们的一个例子
5 and that will be one of our examples

541
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,625
然后这里的一般情况确定没问题
and then the general case here ok ok so

542
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,085
我正在使用它
I'm using this

543
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,935
我不打算这会很有趣
I'm not going to it would be interesting

544
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,725
尽量减少那件事，但我们不是
to minimize that thing but we're not

545
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,025
去那里让我们隐藏它所以我们不这样做
going there let's hide it so so we don't

546
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,674
再次看到它，我将与之合作
see it again and I'll work with that

547
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,104
例如ok，所以这里是渐变
example ok so here's here's gradient

548
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:36,275
降落
descent

549
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:44,055
是XK加1是XK减去SK的步骤
is XK plus 1 is XK minus SK the step

550
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,875
大小乘以X的渐变为X好
size times the gradient of s at X okay

551
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,995
所以唯一剩下的东西需要我们
so the only thing left that requires us

552
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,255
输入一些决策是
to input some decision-making is the

553
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,555
步长我们可以采取的学习率
step size the learning rate we can take

554
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,425
如果我们采取太大的a，它就是不变的
it as constant if we take too big a

555
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,885
学习率会让事情发生变化
learning rate the thing will oscillate

556
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,505
到处都是它的地方
all over the place and where it's a

557
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,865
如果我们学习太少，那就是灾难
disaster if we take too small a learning

558
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,145
速度太小步骤是什么问题
rate too small steps what's the matter

559
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,205
这需要太长时间
with that takes too long takes too long

560
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,855
所以我们的问题是要做到这一点
so we the problem is to get it just

561
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,965
正确和一种你可以说得到的方式
right and one way that you could say get

562
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:36,585
它是正确的想到优化
it right would be to think of optimize

563
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,465
当然选择最佳SK
choose the optimal SK of course that

564
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,515
花费的时间比决定SK的时间要长
takes longer than just deciding an SK in

565
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,425
推进这是人们所做的事情
advance which is what people do so I

566
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,415
认为人们所做的事情真的很重要
think what people do is on really big

567
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,955
问题是SK估计a
problems is take an SK estimate a

568
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,985
合适的SK，然后用它去了
suitable SK and then go with it for a

569
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,695
然后回头看看是不是
while and then look back to see was it

570
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,255
如果它太大他们会看到
if it was too big they'll see

571
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,475
在你知道这将是振荡
oscillations in the you know it'll be

572
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,925
整个地方或当然都在弹跳
bouncing all over the place or of course

573
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,475
一个确切的行搜索，所以你看到了
an exact line search so you see that

574
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,845
这个表达通常是一个确切的线
this expression often an exact line

575
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:30,945
搜索选择SK来制作我的功能f
search choose SK to make my function f

576
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:38,985
在XK加1线上的最小值
at XK plus 1 a minimum on the line on

577
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:42,615
在他们的搜索线上这个
the on their search line this in the

578
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,665
搜索最少的
search a lot minimum in the

579
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:54,814
在搜索中直接搜索
in the search direct the search

580
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,995
方向由渐变给出
Direction is given by the gradient

581
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,854
这就是我们改变这个方向的方向
that's the direction we're moving this

582
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:02,705
是我们移动的距离还是a
is the distance we're moving or a

583
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,195
衡量我们正在移动的距离
measure of the distance we're moving and

584
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,074
一个精确的搜索将继续
an exact search would be to go along

585
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,824
如果我有凸函数那么
there if I have a convex function then

586
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,554
随着我的增加，我沿着这条线移动
as I move along this line as I increase

587
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,715
SK我会看到该功能开始下降
SK I'll see the function start down

588
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,675
因为渐变负梯度
because the gradient negative gradient

589
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,364
意味着向下，但在某些时候它会转向
means down but at some point it'll turn

590
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,584
再次和那个精确的线搜索
up again and that an exact line search

591
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:33,094
会找到那一点并停在那里
would find that point and stop there

592
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:38,675
好吧，这并不意味着我们你知道吗
okay that doesn't mean we would you know

593
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,745
我们将在这个例子中看到我们在哪里
we will see in this example where we

594
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:45,635
将完全搜索一个
will do exactly searches that for a

595
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,385
B值很小，速度极慢
small value of B it's extremely slow

596
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,844
条件号控制
that the condition number controls the

597
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,294
速度真的是我的信息
speed that's really what my message will

598
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:58,505
只是在最后一分钟和下一分钟
be just in these last minute and next

599
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,145
时间关键的讲座
time the sort of key lecture on on

600
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,175
梯度下降确定如此确切的线
gradient descent ok so an exact line

601
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,235
搜索将是那样的
search would be that so what a

602
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:16,445
回溯线搜索回溯
backtracking line search backtracking

603
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:28,675
将是一个固定的s，如1然后
would be take a fixed s like 1 and then

604
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,594
准备来向后把它
be prepared to come backwards take it

605
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,864
减少一半，看看你得到了什么
take cut back by half see what you get

606
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:37,535
那时减少了一半
at that point cut back by half of that

607
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,354
到原来步骤的四分之一看
to a quarter of the original step see

608
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,015
那是什么
what that is

609
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,785
当你如果你那么充实
and when you if your so the the full

610
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,285
步骤可能会带你回到
step might have taken you back to the

611
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,344
半途向前中途向上扫
upward sweep halfway halfway forward

612
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:55,594
可能仍然在向上扫威力
might still be on the upward sweep might

613
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,354
可能是太多，但这样出尔反尔
might be too much but so backtracking

614
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:59,495
削减了
cuts the

615
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,965
步长大小并检查直到
step size in pieces and and checks until

616
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:12,485
所以不是一半而不是季度
it so so so s not half of s not quarter

617
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,035
s不是或明显不同
of s not or obviously a different

618
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,545
参数不是平方而不是
parameter a s not a squared s not and so

619
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:23,435
直到你对此感到满意为止
on until you're satisfied with with that

620
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,155
一步好，那当然有很多
step okay and there of course many many

621
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,745
改进我们谈论的是大事
refinements we're talking about the big

622
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:38,425
每个人都发现的算法
algorithm here that everybody finds has

623
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,415
根据它们的功能具有
depending on their function has

624
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,345
与还好还好如此不同的经历
different experiences with okay okay so

625
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:47,185
这是我的这里是我的基本问题
here's my here's my fundamental question

626
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,935
如果我想到一条确切的线怎么办？
what if I do to think of an exact line

627
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,205
搜索减少了多少
search how much does that reduce the

628
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:59,135
功能减少了多少
function how much does that reduce the

629
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,665
功能，这真的是什么
function so that's really what the

630
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,975
界定，我想，有多少是不
bounds that I want or how much does that

631
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,995
减少功能，它会
reduce the function and it will will

632
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:21,685
将看到减少涉及
will see that the reduction involves

633
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:29,165
他们的条件数M超过N，为什么呢
their condition number M over N so why

634
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,035
我不要先看看这个例子
don't I turn to the example first and

635
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,975
然后我们知道确切的地方
then where the where we know exact

636
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,495
答案给了我们一个基础
answers that gives us a basis for

637
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,915
比较，然后我们就是我们的
comparison and we're then we're then our

638
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,795
群众目标是证明得到的确是一定的
mass goal is prove get s did bounds on

639
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,535
与我们匹配的F的大小
the size of F that that match what we

640
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,655
准确地看那个我们的例子
see exactly in that example where we

641
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,385
我们知道我们所知道的一切
know everything we know that we know the

642
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,455
梯度我们知道Hessian就是这样
gradient we know the Hessian it's that

643
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,765
矩阵我们知道条件数等等
matrix we know the condition number so

644
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:13,135
如果我从x0y0点开始会发生什么
what happens if I start at a point x0 y0

645
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:20,765
在我的表面上对不起我是什么
that's on my surface sorry what do I

646
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,885
我想在这里做，是的，我明白了
want to do here that yeah I take a point

647
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:36,185
x0y0，好的，所以这里是这里的
x0 y0 and okay so here here's the here's

648
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:52,345
新的XYk加1是XYK减去S
the new XY k plus 1 is X Y K minus the S

649
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,475
我可以计算的次数
times of which I can compute times the

650
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,755
F的梯度所以我要投入
gradient of F so I'm going to put in

651
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,255
F的渐变这里的渐变是什么
gradient of F what is the gradient here

652
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,315
梯度是衍生物的关系
the gradient the derivative with respect

653
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:13,345
到X所以我有一个2x好，并成为Y.
to X so I have a 2x okay and to be Y

654
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,315
好吧，那是我的，这就是
okay right that's my and this is the

655
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,915
步长可以和这个小
step size okay and for this small

656
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,135
我们要得到这样的问题
problem where we're going to get such a

657
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,075
揭示答案我会选择确切的
revealing answer I'm gonna choose exact

658
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,725
线搜索我会选择最好的
line search I'm going to choose the best

659
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,705
XK好的，答案是什么让我
XK okay and what's the answer so let me

660
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,325
我只是想告诉你什么
I just want to tell you what the

661
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,775
迭代是针对那个特定的
iterations are for that particular

662
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:49,925
功能从x0y0开始启动
function starting at x0 y0 start start

663
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:55,605
x0y0而我还没有这样做
x0 y0 and I haven't done this

664
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,945
计算自己它取自
calculation myself it's taken from the

665
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,305
斯蒂芬博伊德和范登伯格的书
book by Stephen Boyd and Vandenberg

666
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,495
当然称为凸优化
called convex optimization of course

667
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,475
他们没有不是第一个这样做
they didn't weren't the first to do this

668
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,845
不管怎么说，我很乐意提及
either but that's a I'm happy to mention

669
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,535
那本书凸优化和
that book convex optimization and

670
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,635
斯蒂芬·博伊德将在校园这个
Stephen Boyd will be on campus this

671
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,185
春天实际上是四月份的三个
spring actually in in April for three

672
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,595
讲座
lectures

673
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,985
这是四月也许没关系
this is April maybe yeah okay

674
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,625
所以这个月是两三个星期
so it's this month in two or three weeks

675
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,475
我会告诉你关于那么好的事情
and I'll tell you about that so okay so

676
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,945
这里有XChes和
here are the here are the X Ches and the

677
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,385
ycase和F以及函数值
y case and the F and the function values

678
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,105
好的
okay

679
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:45,285
所以XK所以我要去哪里开始
so XK so where am I going to start yep

680
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,345
所以我从X0y0开始
so I'm starting from the point X 0 y 0

681
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,405
等于B，结果是什么
equal B what it turns out that'll make

682
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,795
我们的公式非常方便x0y0
our formulas very convenient x0 y0

683
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,765
等于一个b1好，所以好，所以XK是B次
equals a b1 good so ok so XK is B times

684
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:09,405
关键比B减去B超过B加1到
the key ratio B minus 1 over B plus 1 to

685
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:17,565
K幂和YK碰巧是一个
the K power and YK happens to be one

686
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,005
可能只是它具有相同的比例
might it's just it has this same ratio

687
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:28,745
我的函数f具有相同的比率-
and my function f has the same ratio -

688
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:33,315
这是FK具有相同的比率1减去B.
this is FK has that same ratio 1 minus B

689
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:39,075
超过1加B到K次f0那是
over 1 plus B to the K times f0 that's

690
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,585
我的那是美丽的配方
my that's the beautiful formula that

691
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:52,665
我们要把它当作最好的
we're we're gonna take as the best

692
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,485
例如可能让我们看到它K.
example possible let's just see it K

693
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:01,935
等于0我有XK4月4日YK41
equals 0 I have XK april-b YK 4 1

694
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,315
服务于b-1并告诉我
be serving a b-1 and that tells me the

695
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,735
它的功能下降率
rate of decrease of the function it's

696
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,315
同样的比例所以我在学习什么
the same ratio so what am i learning

697
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,865
从这个例子
from this example

698
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,565
跳出来的是这个比例1
what's jumping out is that this ratio 1

699
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:21,485
减去B超过1加B是至关重要的
minus B over 1 plus B is is crucial

700
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:25,935
这就是如果B是大的话
that's that that's the if B is large if

701
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,925
如果B为B，则B接近1，该比率较小
B is near 1 that ratio is small if B is

702
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,955
接近1，接近0比2和我
near 1 that's near 0 over 2 and I

703
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,385
快速收敛完全没问题
converge quickly no problem at all

704
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:39,885
但是如果B接近于0，如果是我的话
but if B is near 0 if it's if my

705
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,885
条件数是坏的所以不好的情况
condition number is bad so the bad case

706
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:56,085
硬案例是小B加1B是
the hard case is small B plus 1 B is

707
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:00,825
这个比例非常接近1所以我得到了
small that ratio is very near 1 so I get

708
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:04,335
它低于1，比率低于1，所以我
it's below 1 the ratio is below 1 so I'm

709
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,305
收敛我会收敛
getting convergence I do get convergence

710
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:10,755
我确实走下坡路但发生的事情是我
I do go downhill but what happens is I

711
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,795
在我走之前不要走得很远
don't go downhill very far until I'm

712
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,605
后面又回到了上坡，所以
back headed back uphill again so the the

713
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:21,965
为此绘制的图片让我
the picture to draw for this let me

714
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,395
将图片更改为图片中的图片
change that picture to a picture in the

715
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,685
水平的XY平面设置是的
XY plane of the level sets yeah so the

716
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:33,005
图片真的要看是在XY平面上
picture really to see is in the XY plane

717
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:36,945
水平设定F等于常数
the level sets F equal constant that's

718
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,555
什么样的水平说是它的一组
what a level said is it's a set of

719
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,195
点x和y，其中f具有相同的值
points x and y where f has the same

720
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,565
价值和那些看起来像是什么
value and what do those look like let's

721
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:54,285
看到我想你认为什么是什么
see I think what do you think what are

722
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,965
水平集看起来像这样
the level sets look like for for this

723
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,385
如果我看看特别的功能
particular function if I look at the the

724
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:04,515
曲线x平方加上BY平方邪恶
curve x squared plus B Y squared evil

725
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,275
常数就是这个水平集
constant that's what a level set is this

726
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,385
是x平方加上By平方等于或
is x squared plus B y squared equal or

727
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:16,504
常量一个什么样的曲线是
constant what kind of a curve is that

728
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:20,385
这是一个椭圆形，它是什么
that's an ellipse and what's up with

729
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:23,774
那个椭圆是什么形状的呢
that ellipse what's the shape of it so

730
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:27,284
这是因为没有XY术语
it's because there's no XY term that

731
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:30,915
椭圆就好像是排成一列的
ellipse is like well lined up with the

732
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,534
轴是椭圆的主轴
axes the the major axes of the ellipse

733
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,875
是在x和y方向，因为
are on in the x and y directions because

734
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,465
这里没有交叉术语，我们可以
there is no cross term here and we could

735
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,524
如果，总是对齐我们的矩阵
always have diagonalized our matrix if

736
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,044
如果它不是对角线那就没有
it didn't if it wasn't diagonal and that

737
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:49,995
这不会改变任何事情
wouldn't have changed anything so this

738
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,875
是它只是旋转这个基地和
is it's just rotating this base and

739
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,675
我们做得那么好，那是什么
we've done that okay so what's the what

740
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,264
水平集看起来像他们
are the level sets look like they're

741
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:03,425
省略号，假设B是一个小数字
ellipses and suppose B is a small number

742
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,185
如果B是，那么椭圆是什么的
then what's with the ellipses if B is

743
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,385
小我必须去漂亮我必须采取
small I have to go pretty I have to take

744
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,685
一个相当大的Y来匹配X的变化
a pretty large Y to match a change in X

745
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,844
或者我想也许他们是省略号
or I think maybe they're ellipses of

746
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:25,155
那是他们排队等候的
that sort are they they're lined up for

747
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,604
轴，我希望我画画
the axes and I hope I'm drawing the

748
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:29,895
正确的方向画
right drawing on the right direction

749
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,274
他们是长而瘦的是对的
they're long and thin is that right

750
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,135
因为我不得不采取一个漂亮的
because I would have to take a pretty

751
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,925
大Y来弥补小B好吧
big Y to make up for a small B okay so

752
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:43,995
当我下降时会发生什么
what happens when I'm descending this

753
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,334
这是一个狭窄的山谷然后想到它
this is a narrow Valley then think of it

754
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:51,945
作为急剧归结在一个山谷
as a valley which comes down steeply in

755
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,675
Y方向但在X方向
the Y direction but in the X direction

756
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,735
我正在越过山谷法律那么
I'm crossing the valleys law so so what

757
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,125
如果我，如果我在那里采取一点哦，就会发生
happens if I if I take a point there oh

758
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,465
是的，我记得该怎么做
yeah I remember what to do

759
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,794
所以我们说，让我们在这一点上开始
so let's that let's start at that point

760
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:14,715
在那个椭圆上现在还可以
on that ellipse okay now and those were

761
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,804
水平设定f等于常数，那么什么
the level sets f equal constant so what

762
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:19,514
方向是什么是第一次搜索
direction what's the first search

763
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,304
方向我移动的方向
direction what direction do I move from

764
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:27,605
x0y0
x0 y0

765
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,905
我绝对沿着椭圆移动
do I move along the ellipse absolutely

766
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,245
不是因为它沿着椭圆而已
not because along the ellipse if it's

767
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,385
梯度方向是恒定的
constant the gradient direction is

768
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,885
垂直于你的嘴唇，所以我移动
perpendicular to your lips so I move

769
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,795
垂直于椭圆，何时做
perpendicular to the ellipse and when do

770
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,935
我很快就会停下来，因为我很快就会
I stop pretty soon because very soon I'm

771
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,795
再次回来，所以我开始一些
going back up again so I I start some

772
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,775
好吧，我不知道你是不是我
well I don't know whether you yeah I

773
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,245
没有练习这条曲线，但我
haven't practiced with this curve but I

774
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,565
知道有一次感谢上帝，但是如此
know one time's up thank God but what so

775
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,365
再次我知道什么是要去
once again what do I know is going to

776
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:12,465
发生在星期五，我们会成功
happen and by Friday we'll make it

777
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,365
发生了什么是什么是什么
happen so what's the what's what's

778
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:20,145
什么是我们看到的曲线
what's what do we see for the curve that

779
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:26,025
它的轨道说它是一个
the the track of the it's say it's a

780
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,635
之字形是的，如果我们愿意的话
zigzag yeah so it's if we would like to

781
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,765
来到这里，但我们根本不是针对这里的
get here but we're not aimed here at all

782
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:35,295
所以我们之字形曲折并且非常缓慢
so we zigzag zigzag and very slowly

783
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:42,045
接近这一点，以及如何与慢
approach that point and how slowly with

784
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,345
那个乘数1减去B
that with that that multiplier 1 minus B

785
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:49,455
超过1加B这就是那个
over 1 plus B so that's the that's what

786
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,105
我正在从这个例子中学习
I'm learning from this example that

787
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,525
这是一个关键数字然后你可以
that's a key number and then you could

788
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,655
请问一般的例子
ask well what about general examples

789
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,955
这是一个特别挑选的例子
this was one specially chosen example

790
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,355
我们会看到完全解决方案
with the exact solution well we'll see

791
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,085
在下一次开始的那个
at the beginning of next time that for a

792
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,385
凸函数这是典型的
convex function this is typical it's

793
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,505
这1减B是关键是
this 1 minus B is the key is the

794
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,955
临界数量或1超过B或如何
critical quantity or 1 over B or the how

795
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,645
小是B比1那么就是这样
small is B compared to 1 so that's that

796
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,685
将是关键数量，我们看到
will be the critical quantity and we see

797
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,015
它在这个比例1减去B超过1加B
it in this ratio 1 minus B over 1 plus B

798
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,285
所以如果B是100，这是0.99而不是1.01
so if B is 100th this is 0.99 over 1.01

799
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:34,115
它几乎是1好，所以下次是
it's virtually 1 ok so next time is a

800
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:40,155
看看我有什么关键讲座
sort of a key lecture to see what I've

801
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,875
刚说
just said

802
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,715
这是控制它的
that this is that this controls the

803
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,785
最陡峭的血统收敛然后
convergence of steepest descent and then

804
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:51,405
一看就知道其加速一个想法
to see an idea that speeds it up that

805
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:53,775
这个想法被称为动力或沉重
that idea is called momentum or heavy

806
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,515
球，所以如果你是物理的想法
ball so the physical idea is if you're

807
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,645
如果你想得到沉重的话
if you wanted to get if you had a heavy

808
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,675
球在那里，想得到它
ball right there and wanted to get it

809
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,005
沿着山谷向下走到你的底部
down the valley toward the bottom you

810
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:10,215
不会垂直于水平
wouldn't go perpendicular to the level

811
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,645
你根本没有让动力
sets not at all you let the momentum of

812
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:16,145
球接管并让它滚下来
the ball take over and let it roll down

813
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:19,995
所以动量的想法就是建模
so the the idea of momentum is to model

814
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,425
让这种沉重的可能性
the possibility of letting that heavy

815
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:27,755
球滚动而不是指挥它
ball roll instead of directing it by

816
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,495
每个点都有最陡的下降
steepest descent at every point so

817
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,385
最陡的一个额外的术语
there's an extra term in steepest

818
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,965
下降的势头转向了那个
descent the momentum turn that

819
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,950
accelerates it okay so Friday is the day

820
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:42,760
加速它好，所以星期五是一天

821
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,760
那么很高兴见到你
good see you then
