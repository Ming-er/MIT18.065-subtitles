9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,524
所以我提到了随机线性
so I've mentioned randomized linear

10
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:29,074
代数几次，我觉得我很好
algebra a few times and I thought ok I'm

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:34,415
要跳进去描述随机的
gonna jump in and describe randomized

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,715
矩阵乘法它非常酷
matrix multiplication it's a pretty cool

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,575
这个想法在我看来是这样的
idea it seems to me so so this is a

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,035
随机线性代数中的主题
topic within randomized linear algebra

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,465
当我们会做任何这
and when would we be doing any of this

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,335
这将是对于那些刚刚矩阵
it would be for matrices that are just

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,815
真的很大，所以我们打算抽样
really really large so we plan to sample

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:00,235
a的列和样本
the columns of a and sample the

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,365
相应的B行实际上是
corresponding rows of B so actually the

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,585
当我们决定列时，我们也是
when we decide on a column we've also

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,424
决定连续，所以我们采取这些
decided on a row so we're taking those

22
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:13,565
正确加起来的B件
pieces which do correctly add up to a B

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,144
但我们不打算全部接受它们
but we're not going to take them all

24
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:20,154
我们要采取不同的人
we're going to take different ones

25
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,095
随机抽样我们的概率
randomly sampled with probabilities we

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,934
必须决定概率然后
have to decide probabilities and then

27
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,415
我们会加上我们的样品，我们希望
we'll add up our samples and we hope

28
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,614
结果接近于B的结果
that the result is close to a B that's

29
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:45,784
这个想法没关系，所以这个讲座呢
the idea okay so this this lecture then

30
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:50,464
所以我写了这些页面大约六个月
so I wrote these pages about six months

31
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,095
所以我一直在拼命想
ago so I've been desperately trying to

32
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,794
记得我写的是因为它不是
remember what I wrote because it's not a

33
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,074
以前我曾经说过的话题
subject I have ever spoken about before

34
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,614
但它是如此整洁，所以这里有一些
but it's so neat so here are some of the

35
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,284
事情进入它，我们必须
things that come into it we have to

36
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,885
决定我们想要的概率
decide on probabilities then we want to

37
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,544
计算均值所以它就是我们的
compute the mean so so it's it's our

38
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,705
有一些关键的第一天我
first day with some of these key I

39
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,575
从统计和概率，所以我们
from statistics and probability so we're

40
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,905
要采取增加一个的概率
gonna take probabilities that add to one

41
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,585
我们要弄明白是什么意思
we're gonna figure out what's the mean

42
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,125
我们希望和我们随机的B值
value of our random a B we hope and we

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,615
将看到的平均值
will see that the mean value of the

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,405
随机的B是正确的B但是那里
random a B is the correct a B but there

45
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,675
将是一个变化，我们不会得到每一个
will be a variance we won't get every

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,835
样品不会在事实上不正确
sample won't be correct in fact no

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,545
样品是正确的
samples will be correct

48
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,305
只有当我们平均添加它们时
only when we add them up on the average

49
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,485
我们得到纠正B的正确答案
the correct answer we get to correct a B

50
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,085
但所以意思是正确的
but so the mean will come out right

51
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,965
它会出来作为B你会看到它
it'll come out as a B you'll see it

52
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,915
发生
happen

53
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,545
是正确的，但不是很大的变化
correct but there's a big variance not

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,935
零将遍布整个地方
zero will be all over the place

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,945
我们的样品只是平均值
with our samples they'll just average

56
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,925
对了，但他们将全部结束
out right but they'll be all over

57
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,355
没有没有特别的样品将在权
no no particular sample will be right at

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,635
所以我们想要选择最好的
all so then we want to pick the best

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,895
这样我们工作的可能性
probabilities when the so our job will

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,065
一旦我们看到系统如何运作
be once we see how the system works

61
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,545
我们要分配概率和
we're going to assign probabilities and

62
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,465
我们要选择概率
we're going to choose the probabilities

63
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,095
最小化方差所以这是一个
that minimize the variance so this is a

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,575
典型情况下平均为
typical situation where the mean is

65
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,695
非常直截了当，做了什么
pretty straightforward and and does what

66
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,965
你想要但是有正确的意思
you want but having the correct mean

67
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,395
并不意味着你已经在取得了很好的答案
does not mean you've got good answers at

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,025
你知道的所有平均值都是负M
all the average of you know like minus M

69
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,185
零下一百一百是
minus a hundred and a hundred is it

70
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,795
可能是一个正确的答案是零但是
might be a correct answer is zero but

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,035
你离开了，这就是如何衡量的
you're way off so and this measures how

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,845
你是这样，我不知道你是否知道
far you are so I don't know if you know

73
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,995
这些话很不幸，但我想
these words it's unfortunate but I guess

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,625
1806五现在不能改变它了
1806 five can't change it now that the

75
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,655
差异写成Sigma平方和我们
variance is written Sigma squared and we

76
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,815
已经很好地使用了这封信
already have a good use for the letter

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,345
希腊字母Sigma但是
the Greek letter Sigma but

78
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,495
今天它有不同的用途
today it has a different use for

79
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,995
差异和这个拉格朗纳供应商将
variance and this lagron suppliers will

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,365
接近尾声所以基本上让我
come in near the end so basically let me

81
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,595
让我做一个实践例子来样
let me do a practice example to kind of

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,055
回想一下什么意思和方差以及什么
recall what mean and variance and what

83
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,905
那些是关于所以让我拿一个矩阵
those are about so let me take a matrix

84
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,615
通过2是1，所以我的我的矩阵只是
that's 1 by 2 so my my matrix is just

85
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:59,825
要做个B没关系我会说样品
gonna be a B okay I'm gonna sample that

86
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,465
两次和我的两个规则
and twice and my rule for the two

87
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,485
样品将是相同的，他们将
samples will be the same they will be

88
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,905
相同的完全分布式
identically distributed totally

89
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,035
相同，我的规则是什么
identical and what's my rule gonna be so

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,675
这就像我的做法规则是怎么回事
this is like practice my rule is going

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,775
是我拿那个专栏或那个专栏
to be I take that column or that column

92
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,865
概率1/2好吧，我做到了
with probabilities 1/2 okay and I do it

93
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,755
两次如此如此，我取平均值，从而
twice so so and I take the average so

94
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,675
我将采取他们的概率
I'm going to take probabilities they're

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,385
将是一个一半一半了
going to be one half one half for the

96
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,835
两列，我会做的等于
two columns and I'm gonna do s equal to

97
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:50,895
两个样本，我会增加重量
two samples and I'm gonna add weight

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:59,705
他们和我一起取平均值
them with and I'll take the average of

99
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:08,495
这两个样品还可以，这将是我的
the two samples okay and that will be my

100
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,005
随机矩阵好吧我们也可以
randomized matrix okay so could we

101
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,045
计算这个的意思所以我
compute the mean for this so I've

102
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,435
描述了随机抽样过程
described a randomized sampling process

103
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,625
我给你一半的概率
I've given you the probabilities half

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,205
我要去的次数是他的一半
and a half the number of times I'm going

105
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,635
做到这一点然后我除以那个
to do it and then I divide by that

106
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,755
所以我真的有这么多次
number of times so this is really I have

107
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,665
1在这儿是因为我有S的
a 1 over s here because I've got s of

108
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,735
这些现在这么哪些
these and now so what are the

109
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,895
这里的可能性我想找到
possibilities here I want to find the

110
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,815
首先意味着它
mean first of all it's

111
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,055
是一个卑鄙的好，所以这里有两个我可以
was a mean okay so here are two I could

112
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,305
想到两个不同的方法来计算
think of two different ways to compute

113
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,215
让我从这个开始的意思是什么
the mean let me start with this one what

114
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,975
是平均值均值的平均值
is the mean the average value mean means

115
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,295
第一样本的平均值，因此
average value of the first sample so the

116
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,665
第一个样本I的平均值
average value of the first sample I

117
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,505
将军的意思是什么？
would what does the mean the general

118
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,325
公式是你加起来所有的样本
formula is you add up all the sample

119
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:17,115
采样时间是可能的样本
sample times it's the possible samples

120
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,005
倍的概率，在这种
times their probabilities and in this

121
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,205
情况的概率是一半即
case the probabilities are one-half that

122
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,735
样本是零和一半
the sample is a zero and one half that

123
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,525
样本是零拍，所以那些是我的
the sample is zero beat so those are my

124
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,765
两个样本并计算平均值
two samples and computing the mean of

125
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,175
总得到哦，但这意味着
the total I get oh but that mean for

126
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,635
每个样本，但我必须繁殖
each sample but then I have to multiply

127
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,655
所以，让我把这里的一半放在这里
so so let's put what I got here half of

128
00:07:53,660 --> 00:08:01,355
一个是为每一个样本的意义
a be that was the meaning of each sample

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,125
因为我的概率是相等的一半
because my probabilities were equal half

130
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,505
一半，现在我有两个人
and half and now I've got se for two

131
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:22,175
样本所以我乘以2得到一个B.
samples so I multiply by 2 and I get a B

132
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:36,585
并且平均值是正确的
and the mean mean is correct

133
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,714
好的，我们现在做的很简单
good we did the easy one the mean now

134
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,325
练习方差或退出
practice with the variance or else quit

135
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,335
在这里，也许我应该在我领先的时候退出
here maybe I should quit while I'm ahead

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,455
我的意思完全正确但是
I've got the mean exactly right but of

137
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,185
当然，样本可能不适合如此
course the samples might not be right so

138
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,565
对于方差现在怎么样呢？
what's so now for the variance so how do

139
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,635
什么是方差你还记得吗？
what is variance do you remember that

140
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,765
实际上有两种计算方法
there are actually two ways to compute

141
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,605
方差
variance

142
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,325
让我记住那里的人
let me just remember those over here and

143
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,245
把那块板推上去，以便方差Sigma
push that board up so the variance Sigma

144
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,395
如果你是的话，请原谅我
squared forgive me if you're a

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,065
统计学家就像你知道的那样
statistician this is like like you know

146
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,915
布伦特就像你出生时就知道这一点
Brent like you were born knowing this

147
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,305
但我们其他人不是这样的
but the rest of us were not so the

148
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,365
方差就是一种方法
variance is there's the sum one way to

149
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,095
这样做就是加起来的不同
do it is add up the different

150
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,795
不同事物的概率
probabilities of different things that

151
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:47,584
输出可能会减去平均值
could happen of output minus the mean

152
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,875
平方所以它一般它的
squared so it's the average it's the

153
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:03,875
平均距离肉的平方距离
average distance squared from the meat

154
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,185
所以它需要我的任何输出
so it takes whatever output I have that

155
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,625
输出数字减去平均值
came with output number I minus the mean

156
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,935
这是我平方的平均输出
which is the average output I square

157
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,175
那些和我得到一个数字，那种
those and I get a number and that sort

158
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,595
告诉我这是怎么告诉我的
of tells me how that tells me like in

159
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:29,335
在着名的高斯
the in the famous Gaussian

160
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,405
如果我在这里有高斯分布我
if I had a Gaussian distribution here I

161
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,015
分布为1/2和1/2
have a distribution of 1/2 and 1/2 so

162
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,045
我喜欢甚至可能有一个名字
I'm like that's maybe even has a name

163
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,675
像二项式或其他东西或伯努利
like binomial or something or Bernoulli

164
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,315
或者除了这个高斯之外的任何东西
or whatever but here on this Gaussian

165
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,455
我们都记得
that we all remember

166
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,785
我可以在那个图中标出什么
can I mark in the what in that figure

167
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,525
其中的意思是正确的
where the mean is that right in the

168
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:59,795
中心就像我，我可以，什么是
center like ok me and can and what is

169
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,215
方差只是为了回忆一下
the variance just to recall what

170
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,345
第一次大家都可以
everybody in the first time may even

171
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,005
听到那个词变异的是什么
hear that word variance the what is the

172
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,495
差异测量就是这样
variance kind of measuring it's it's

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,735
你的总和正方形，无论是
your you're summing squares so whether

174
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,415
你在平均值或权
you're on the right of the mean or the

175
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,455
左边的平均没有区别因为
left of the mean no difference because

176
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,095
你正在瞄准它，这是距离
you're squaring it and it's the distance

177
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,825
所以方差就是这样的意思
so so the mean the variance would be

178
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,385
有点像典型的宽度也许我
sort of like a typical width maybe I

179
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,175
过度了，但这将是一种
overdid it but that would be a sort of

180
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:38,345
典型的西格玛我真的只是因为
typical Sigma I'm really just since the

181
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,685
单词统计均值和方差
words statistics mean and variance

182
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,845
在1806年没有提到五个
haven't been mentioned in 1806 five

183
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,425
直到今天，我只是回忆起来
until today I'm just kind of recalling

184
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,145
他们还好，所以现在我准备计算了
them ok so now I'm prepared to compute

185
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:55,085
这个例子好吧也许我也许我会
this example ok maybe I'll maybe I'll

186
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:01,175
在这里计算它确定所以我计算
compute it over here ok so so I compute

187
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,815
然后是每个样本的方差
the variance for each sample and then

188
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,915
我会乘以2因为我有两个
I'll multiply by two because I have two

189
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,445
那些样品是什么样的呢？
samples so what are they so this is the

190
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:16,775
西格玛平方的样本显然我可以
Sigma squared sample obviously I could

191
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,355
写下所有的可能性是的
write down all the possibilities yeah

192
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,815
让我这样做了一个月，因此
let me just do this a month so the

193
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,625
样本可能已经选出0
sample could either have picked out a 0

194
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,755
或0B，概率为1/2
or 0 B and the probabilities were 1/2 so

195
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,575
II的概率次数是概率的1/2倍
I I have 1/2 times the probability times

196
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,084
输出让我们说输出是
the output let's say the output is

197
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:50,054
零减去已结束的平均值
a zero minus the mean which was a over

198
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:55,804
超过两个，我想把它解决
to be over two and I want to square that

199
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,724
所以这是我的一种可能性
so that was one possibility when I

200
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:02,024
选了零，另一个选了
picked a zero and the other one which

201
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:04,334
我也在做概率1/2
I'm also doing with probability 1/2 is

202
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:15,944
如果我选择0B你看到了什么
in case I picked 0 B what was you see

203
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:19,174
因为差异，我不是0
I'm I'm not getting 0 for the variance

204
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,764
因为每次我都犯了错误
because every time I'm making an error

205
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,074
每次我都没有得到正确的答案
every time I'm never getting the correct

206
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,554
一个零或正确的零B，因为我
a zero or the correct zero B because I'm

207
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,524
总是在中间做这个好吗
always doing this one in the middle okay

208
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,504
现在，如果我计算所有我得到的
now if I compute all that I get a

209
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,134
量，也许我只是要上
quantity and maybe I'll just be to be on

210
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,184
安全的一面
the safe side

211
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:42,974
如果我写的，请问你的原谅
ask your forgiveness if I write the

212
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:45,914
回答，我们甚至可以尝试得到
answer and we could even try to get the

213
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:56,554
回答，但这是两个样本
answer but so this is from two samples

214
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:04,424
所以这是翻了一番一个做
so this is doubled that one do

215
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:10,184
我想我足够大胆尝试如此
I guess I'm bold enough to try it so so

216
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,544
零，所以这将是一个减去
a zero so that would be a minus a over

217
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,154
我认为两个和一个B和一个B超过两个
two and a B and a B over two I think

218
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:25,124
我认为看起来有一半了
we've got here one half of I think looks

219
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:33,014
对我来说就像一个超过两平方加B
to me like a over two squared plus B

220
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:38,624
我失去了正负，但它
over I'm missing by plus or minus but it

221
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,454
当我把它们整理成一体时
when I'm squaring them that's the whole

222
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,974
方差点没关系和
point of variance doesn't matter and the

223
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:49,624
B超过两个，在这里我想我就是我
B over two and here I think I'm I'm

224
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,514
两个人错了，我错了
wrong by a over two and I'm wrong by

225
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,494
加上B超过
plus by B over

226
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,644
两个或八个超过两个，但当我
two or minus eight over two but when I

227
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:00,104
把它们放在一起并不重要，所以我
square them again doesn't matter so I

228
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:04,004
我认为我得到了另外两半
think I get another half of a over two

229
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:11,194
正方形加B超过2平方
squares plus B over 2 squared

230
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,394
原谅我这么简单
what forgive me for this simple

231
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,294
计算，但只是为了练习那么
computation but just to practice so what

232
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,794
如果我得到了一半的话
have I got I've got a half of that in

233
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,314
的一半，这样加起来是这个
half of that so that adds up to this

234
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:27,074
平方超过四加B平方的东西
thing a squared over four plus B squared

235
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,794
超过四，但我正在做两个样本
over four but then I'm doing two samples

236
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,144
我会通过数量乘以
I'll have to multiply by the number of

237
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:38,744
样本所以我想两次两次
samples so I think so times two for two

238
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:42,914
我认为我得到的样本是1/4
samples I think I'm getting it was 1/4

239
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,354
但现在它将是平方B的1/2
but now it'll be 1/2 of a squared B

240
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:52,544
广场哦是的我没有呀呀嘿
Square oh yeah I didn't yeah yeah hey

241
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,204
是的，我认为我认为这是正确的
yeah I think I think that's right but

242
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:59,494
原谅我，我只是问自己是的
forgive me while I just ask myself yeah

243
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:05,384
是的，这实际上已经是你了
yeah this will be actually you already

244
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,404
有这些笔记
have these notes

245
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:10,304
这是第2.4节，所以我认为它是
this is section 2.4 so it's I think it's

246
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:14,715
他们自己的stiller所以有什么意义
their own stiller so what's the point of

247
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,184
这第一点是要记住
this first point was to like remember

248
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:21,494
进入的一些步骤
some of the steps that go into the

249
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:25,124
方差哦还有另一个公式
variance oh there's another formula for

250
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,554
我要告诉你和你的差异
variance that I want to tell you and the

251
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,914
第二点是要在把
second point is to make to bring in a

252
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:36,044
新想法假设我们想要做到这一点
new idea suppose we want to make this

253
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:38,684
假设这种差异比我们大
suppose this variance is bigger than we

254
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:42,704
我想假设B很多
want suppose for example that B is a lot

255
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:45,854
不是假设b越大很多大
bigger than a suppose B is a lot bigger

256
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:48,404
比那应该我们做
than a then what should we have done

257
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,494
不同的随机随机
differently in this random randomized

258
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:55,304
线性代数，如果我想要得到这个
linear algebra if I'm trying to get this

259
00:16:55,309 --> 00:17:01,234
事关亲近那个东西和
thing closed get close to that thing and

260
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:04,424
如果B比那么大了
if B is a lot bigger than a then what

261
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:05,935
我应该做些不同的事
should I do different

262
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:12,475
我不知道B究竟是什么，但我
I don't know what B is exactly but I

263
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,635
拥有更大的信息
have the information that it's bigger

264
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,965
比那时我应该增加了
than a then I should increase the

265
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,405
概率我不应该做一半
probability I shouldn't do half and half

266
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,175
所以这里是随机抽样
so here here was randomized sampling

267
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,935
取平均值我的概率是
taking the average my probabilities were

268
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,965
一半，但如果我想要我
a half and a half but if I want I

269
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,345
相信我可以保持平均值
believe that I could keep the mean

270
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,465
当然这是正确的
correct of course that's fundamental to

271
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,515
得到正确的权利，并获得更好的
get the mean right and get a better

272
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,455
答案比这更小
answer get a smaller variance than that

273
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,955
B通过挑选那个方形在那里
B squared over there by picking that

274
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,625
那个概率更高的东西
thing with higher probability so that's

275
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:03,295
随机的'男人出去的地方
where the randomized 'men out to be

276
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,695
称为norm平方概率I
called norm squared probability the I

277
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:14,155
什么是概率的决定
the the decision on what the probability

278
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,635
应该是事实证明是
should be goes it turns out to be the

279
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,635
最优的一个与广场相符
optimal one goes with the square of the

280
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,345
如果B是a和I的两倍那么大小
size so if B is twice as big as a and I

281
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,165
想要得到方差然后
want to get the variance down then the

282
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,255
概率我应该使用概率
probability I should use probabilities

283
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,015
这是经常的四倍四倍
that are four times four times as often

284
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,325
我会选择B而不是那个
I will choose B than a that's going to

285
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,615
是两点钟的结论
be the conclusion at two o'clock

286
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,305
希望没关系，所以这是一点
hopefully okay there so that's one point

287
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,885
并且，只是另一个小点，同时
and and just another little point while

288
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,195
我们正在审查方差
we're while we are reviewing variance

289
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,415
这是对标准公式
this is the standard formula for the

290
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,625
所有可能的方差和
variance sum of all the possible

291
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,135
结果与他们的概率
outcomes with their probabilities the

292
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,255
距离均方的距离是多少？
distance from the mean squared do you

293
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,195
知道第二公式，这是非常
know a second formula which is very

294
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,285
接近这个和它非常相似
close to this and very similar and it

295
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,545
来自于取代的含义
comes from substituting the meaning of

296
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,435
意味着平均值是这样的东西
means something where the mean is so

297
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,195
是啊，所以我只是我只是想提
yeah so I just I just want to mention a

298
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,054
第二个公式，我不知道
second formula and I don't I don't know

299
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,545
哪一个实际上会使用但是
which one will actually use but the

300
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,765
相同数量的第二个公式
second formula for the same quantity

301
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:45,755
西格玛广场是这个总和
Sigma square is this sum of

302
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:55,695
概率乘以输出平方所以我
probabilities times output square so I

303
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,765
没有减去这个中的平均值
haven't subtracted off the mean in this

304
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,945
第二个公式我现在必须这样做
second formula I have to do it now and

305
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,495
我会做的意思是我会做所有的意思
I'll do the mean I'll do the mean all at

306
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:12,674
一旦均方当然的意思
once mean squared of course the mean

307
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,505
涉及记住，平均是
involves remember that the mean is the

308
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,325
概率乘以的概率
sums of the probabilities times the

309
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:28,424
结果，它只是玩一个
outcomes and it's just playing with a

310
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:31,065
小代数表明你可以
little algebra to show that you can

311
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,804
或者你可以选择任何东西
either you have a choice of whatever is

312
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,265
更方便的是减去平均值
more convenient subtract the mean off

313
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:40,265
从每个输出或做所有输出
from each output or do all the outputs

314
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,635
但是你没有考虑到
but then you haven't accounted for the

315
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,845
事实上，你真的想要距离
fact that you really want the distances

316
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,635
从平均值然后你减去
from the mean and then you subtract off

317
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,674
平均值有两种方法可以做到
the mean squared two ways to do it

318
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,595
有两种方法可以做到这一点，是的，我们
two ways to equal ways to do it yeah we

319
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,455
将审查平均和。的基本思想
will review the basic ideas of mean and

320
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,815
在该部分中的差异
variance in the in the in the section on

321
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,795
这里的概率我是的问题是的
probability here I'm yes question yeah

322
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,045
这里的意思是哦
the mean oh in in here

323
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,475
在分开是的，这是重点
at separate yeah that's the whole point

324
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,045
是啊所以这是喜欢做这个，然后
yeah so this was like do this and then

325
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,725
减去均方或保持
subtract off the mean squared or keep

326
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,545
在每个学期的平均值，并做到这一点
the mean in every term and do it that

327
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,815
办法
way

328
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,264
你可以验证这两个是
you could verify that the two are are

329
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:41,985
同样没关系所以当我们现在去的时候
the same okay so when we go now to the

330
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,715
更大的问题我忘了哪个方向
bigger question I've forgotten which way

331
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,804
我这样做但是我可以自由选择好吧
I do it but I'm free to choose okay is

332
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,435
就像一个小样本合理而且
that like a small sample reasonable and

333
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,914
你和你明白如果我们
you and you get the idea that if if we

334
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,174
知道如果我们看看我们的矩阵
know that if we if we look at our matrix

335
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,195
首先，找出哪些列
first of all and find out which columns

336
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,715
是大点大规范和哪个
are large dot large norm and which

337
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,235
列小则可能是
columns are smaller then that might be

338
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,284
有用的信息来衡量我们的
useful information to weight our

339
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:17,634
挑选较大的概率
probabilities to pick the larger one

340
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:23,034
更经常没关系，其实让我好吧
more often okay okay well in fact let me

341
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,585
告诉你这两者是什么
just tell you what are the two

342
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,644
可能还有一个就是我刚才
possibilities there one is what I just

343
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:32,695
说等你的概率
said wait your probabilities by the

344
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,784
这个规范平方的常数平方
square of the norm this norm squared

345
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:40,225
等待，我们会看到并采取
waiting that we'll see and take the

346
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,255
列虽然来了，但更高
columns as they come but with higher

347
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,365
大栏目或你的概率
probability on the big columns or you

348
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:51,294
可以说另一种方式是混合
could say another way would be mix the

349
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,685
列使它们或多或少都有
columns so that they more or less have

350
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,435
相似的尺寸，然后跟踪
similar sizes and then keep track of

351
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,075
你做了什么，然后然后
what you've done and then and then just

352
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,404
概率都可以相等，
the probabilities can all be equal so

353
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,355
这将是你的另一种方式
that would be the other way take your

354
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,595
矩阵混合起来采取组合
matrix mix it up take combinations of

355
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,985
用随机数列有
the columns with random numbers there's

356
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,264
一个随机的世界在这里带你做一个混合
a random world here take you do a mixing

357
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:26,715
然后对混合矩阵进行操作
and then operate on the mixed matrix

358
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,144
是啊好吧，我打算这样做第一
yeah okay I'm going to do it the first

359
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:34,245
方式我会选择这些概率
way I'm gonna pick these probabilities

360
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,255
他们将会变成现实
to there'll be they'll turn out to be

361
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,075
与正常平方成正比准备好了
proportional to norm squared okay ready

362
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,144
为此它来了
for that here it comes

363
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:57,484
所以把它带下来是的，好吧我
so bring that down yeah okay actually I

364
00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:01,685
它告诉我们，现在可以把它留下来
could leave it up for now cuz it told us

365
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,414
我们正在做什么
what we're what we're up to

366
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:09,214
好吧所以我得到了什么
okay so so what have I got

367
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:13,774
让我看看我是否可以这样，所以我们
let me just see if I can so so we're

368
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:16,174
乘以B次，我们会
multiplying a times B and we're gonna

369
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,044
使用PJ的这些概率
use these probabilities PJ is going to

370
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:26,014
是该列的长度乘以
be the length of that column times the

371
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:32,254
那排长度的平方很好
length of that row norm squared well

372
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:35,674
如果我将a乘以a，则规范平方
norm squared if I was multiplying a by a

373
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,834
转置然后我真的会
transpose then I really would be

374
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,464
平方那将是相同的
squaring that would be the same as that

375
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:43,445
所以我要使用norm平方这个词
so I'm gonna use the word norm squared

376
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:49,774
或长度平方也在这里
or length squared also here where the

377
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,744
我不假设B是一个
two I'm not assuming that B is a

378
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,174
转置没关系
transpose okay

379
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:57,604
这将是概率意志
so that will be the probabilities will

380
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:00,754
与此成正比，但现在是那些
be proportional to that but now those

381
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,904
那个不加一个，所以我该怎么做
that don't add up to one so how do I

382
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:06,544
使概率加起来一个
make the probabilities add up to one

383
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:15,714
这是选择的概率
this is the probability of of choosing

384
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:26,614
斧子列J排J是什么的
column J of a x times row J that's what

385
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:32,095
这就是PJ所说的好
that's what PJ refers to okay

386
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,865
好吧那我的计划是什么哦我必须这样做
okay so what is my plan oh I have to

387
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,875
使概率加到一个或我
make the probabilities add to one or I'm

388
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,215
真的打破了他们的基本法
really breaking them the fundamental law

389
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,975
在这里，如果我有一堆
here so how if I have a bunch of

390
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,345
概率，我有点知道我
probabilities and I kind of know what I

391
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,325
想要，但他们没有加起来一个
want but they don't add up to one what

392
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,815
我做他/他们的总和让我打电话看
do i do / their sum let me call see

393
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,365
有一些所以概率正在发生
there's some so the probability is going

394
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,025
是C和C的目标
to be that over C and C is is going to

395
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:08,855
是许多行和的总和
be the sum of however many rows and

396
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,965
列我想也许我有R和我的
columns I guess maybe I had R and my

397
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:21,665
一个JVJ转换的图片好吧所以
picture of a J VJ transpose okay so all

398
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,215
我做的是重新调整概率
I did was rescale the probabilities so

399
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,985
他们现在添加到一个好的，所以
that they now add to one good okay so

400
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,585
现在我准备去上班了，我已经准备好了
now I'm ready to go to work I'm ready to

401
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,765
选择哦是的所以这是我的规则
choose oh yes so here's my rule I will

402
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:42,575
选择行列和列行J
choose row column and column row J with

403
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,105
这个概率但是我要去
this probability but then I'm going to

404
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,625
乘以它，如果我，我可以自由地做到这一点
multiply it and I'm free to do that if I

405
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,445
我希望如此近似我的
want to so my approximation my

406
00:26:52,450 --> 00:27:00,355
近似ami将是我会接受这个
approximate ami will be I'll take this

407
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,995
无论哪个出来我都会把AJ当成
whichever comes out I'll take the AJ be

408
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,565
j转置出来它出来了
j transpose there comes out it comes out

409
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,465
有概率PJ，但我要去
with probability P J but I'm going to

410
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,165
除以此，我想我就是这样
divide this by and I think I'm this is

411
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,255
正确的样本数量
the right one s the number of samples

412
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:26,315
PJ所以我一开始就想到了
times PJ so I thought at first that's

413
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,885
奇怪的
weird

414
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,525
去了所有的麻烦来接这些P
went to all the trouble to pick these P

415
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,355
J声称这些都是好事
J's claiming that these are the good

416
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,595
所以我是我最终证明的主张
ones so I'm my claim to eventually prove

417
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,355
最后我首先要明白
at the end first I'll have to understand

418
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,085
采样是如何做到这一点就像
how the sampling is done that's like the

419
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,355
最重要的但是当我走的时候
most important but then when I go

420
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,875
计算平均值我会得到正确的
to compute the mean I'll get the correct

421
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,565
意思是当我去计算时
mean and when I go to get to compute the

422
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,845
方差我会为一些表达
variance I'll get some expression for

423
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:59,145
方差然后计划将是
the variance and then the plan will be

424
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,775
选择这些PJ来减少总数
choose these PJ's to minimize that total

425
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,435
方差所以这就是这个
variance so here so this is what that's

426
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,985
一个这是一个典型的样本
a that's a typical sample with

427
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:16,135
概率PJ挑选那个矩阵
probability PJ pick that that matrix

428
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,215
秩一个矩阵，那么我的
that rank one matrix so then my

429
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,505
近似值B是所有这些的总和
approximate a B is the sum of all these

430
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:31,975
超过你的样品你和我一起让我
over s samples are you with me let me

431
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,125
让我重复一遍，我正在努力
let me just repeat I'm trying to

432
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,355
乘以B每个样本只是一个
multiply a B each sample is just a

433
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,385
单列时间排，所以它的方式
single column times row so it's way

434
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,235
错误的方式错了它只是一小块
wrong way wrong it's just a tiny piece

435
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,285
一个B，但我拿了那个样本
of a B but I take that sample with

436
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,855
概率PJ和我用sPJ把它
probability PJ and I divide it by s PJ

437
00:28:52,860 --> 00:29:03,075
所以这是PJ的取消哦哦，好的
so that's a PJ's cancel here oh yes okay

438
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,015
对，所以我想看看
right so I would like to see that the

439
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,335
意思是正确的我想看到
mean is correct I would like to see that

440
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,085
平均值是正确的我要计算
the mean is correct I'm going to compute

441
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,315
我的过程的意思是它就像它
the mean of my process so it's like it's

442
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,265
落到我的腿上，我做到了
falling into my lap here I made it that

443
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,685
办法
way

444
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,575
这些PJ取消了我除以s
these PJ's canceled I divided by s so

445
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,865
典型样本的平均值将是如此
the mean of a typical sample will be so

446
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:41,005
一个样本的平均值是
the mean of one sample is the

447
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,955
得到它的概率是我的
probability of getting it times what I

448
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,965
这样它只是jbj的总和
take so it's just the sum of a jb j

449
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,315
transpose/s你会说好的
transpose / s you're going to say okay

450
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,685
你在浪费我们的时间，但我们有一个
you're wasting our time but we've got a

451
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,905
我只是想证明我是
I would just want to show that I'm

452
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,635
得到正确的意思
getting the correct mean

453
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,225
出于这个计划，所以你看到了
out of this plan so do you see that if

454
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,775
这是一个样本的平均值所以是什么
that's a mean of one sample so what's

455
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:10,475
所有样本总和的平均值
the mean of the sum of all the samples

456
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,475
好吧x是的，因为它是相同的意思
well x yes because it was the same mean

457
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,785
每个样本都是同样的意思
every sample that the same mean just

458
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,755
就像我们的小联盟一样
just as it did in our little league

459
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,905
练习的例子就是这样的意思
practice example so that's the mean of

460
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,535
一个样本，所以所有样本的平均值
one sample so the mean of all samples

461
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:33,075
添加加在一起乘以此
added added together multiplies this by

462
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:44,175
是的取消了，我得到了B记住
s yeses cancel and I get a B remembering

463
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:52,895
我的方式是，我在那里定义了B，是的
my however way I defined a B there yeah

464
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,805
我在这里说的就是我做的
all I'm saying there here is that I did

465
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,915
抽样中合理的东西
something reasonable in the sampling

466
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,095
过程让平均出来了
process so that the mean came out right

467
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,205
现在是困难的部分
and now is the hard part

468
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:14,055
差异什么是方差好吧
the variance what's the variance okay so

469
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:25,275
我有什么需要计算的，我可以
what do I have to compute and I may it

470
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:37,875
将取决于P1至PRI
will depend on the piece P 1 to P R I

471
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,315
我猜我们有不同的行
guess we had we had our different rows

472
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,145
不同的列行对可供选择和
different column row pairs to choose and

473
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:49,425
我们选择了这些家伙的概率
we chose probabilities these guys that

474
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:53,985
取决于大小，现在我要去
depended on the size and now I'm going

475
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,435
计算方差，它不会
to compute the variance and it won't be

476
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,915
0因为每个样本都是错的我是
0 because every sample is wrong I'm

477
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,665
从来没有从样本中得到样本
never getting from a sample a sample is

478
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,095
只是给我写了一篇专栏文章
just giving me a wrote a column times a

479
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,135
排名第一的人
row a rank one guy

480
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,325
他们平均给出了
and they averaged out to give the

481
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:18,285
正确的产品但每一个都是
correct product but each one is

482
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,465
肯定是错的，因为它只是一个等级
certainly wrong because it's just a rank

483
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,825
一，所以当我计算方差时，我会去
one so when I compute variance I'm going

484
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,425
肯定不会在零中得到零
to definitely not get zero right in

485
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,675
其他的话当然是什么时候的
other words of course when were the

486
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,715
如果B排名，则方差为零
variance be zero yeah if a B were ranked

487
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,245
一个我想每一次我会得到它的权利
one I guess I'd get it right every time

488
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,195
谢谢哦，有一个比我更好的答案
thanks oh there's a better answer than I

489
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,765
记住，是的，差异会
had in mind yeah yeah the variance would

490
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,345
如果每个样本都是正确的，则只有零
only be zero if every sample was right

491
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,975
如果等级是这样的话，那就是真的
and that would be true if the rank was

492
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,075
一个，只有一件事
one and there was only one thing to

493
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,615
选择，但这不是我们的问题
choose but that's not the problem we

494
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:02,445
想要好，所以差异就在我的心里
want okay so the variance is there my my

495
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,845
本能是告诉你这是什么
instinct is to tell you what this

496
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,715
计算产生，因为你和我可以
calculation produces since you and I can

497
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:18,365
读，你会允许我这样做吗
read would you allow me to do that so

498
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:23,055
结果是样本的方差
here the variance for a sample turns out

499
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,465
事实证明我们会这样做
to be it turns out to equal so we will

500
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,965
想办法
figure it out

501
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,585
结果等于它的总和
turns out to equal the sum over as it

502
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:41,285
是AJAJ转置的
was up there of the AJ AJ transpose

503
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:46,305
可能是平方让我只是检查
probably squared let me just just check

504
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,935
是的，是的，为什么我不帮助自己
yes squared yeah why don't I help myself

505
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,365
这是因为这些是平方的
here so these are squared because

506
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,775
方差是平方然后当我
variances are squared and then when I

507
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,205
看看我认为有什么是S
look to see what I think there's an S

508
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,645
那里有一个PJ，为什么有一个
there and there's a PJ so why is there a

509
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,755
PJ那里取消了，所以在这里
PJ there when it cancelled here so here

510
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,705
当我乘以那个PJ时
the PJ when I multiplied by that

511
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,185
取消为什么不取消
cancelled why doesn't it cancel over

512
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,705
因为它在那边平方
there because it's squared over there

513
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,805
那边的东西是平方所以它
over there this thing is squared so it

514
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,634
那是PJ两次
was PJ twice here

515
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,234
PJ是概率一次，所以我仍然是我们
PJ it's probability once so I'm still we

516
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,685
得到PJ的分母1因子
got the PJ in the denominator 1 factor

517
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,584
PJ在分母中然后如此
of PJ in the denominator and then so

518
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:39,044
那就是我猜我正在做的就是我
that is I guess what I'm doing is I'm

519
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:45,254
以这种方式计算方差就是这样
computing the variance this way so what

520
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:48,064
我的电脑现在是他的第一位
I've computer now is his first bit and

521
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:51,225
然后我说应该减去
then I said should should subtract the

522
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,494
平均值，这是一个样本
mean squared and this is for one sample

523
00:34:56,499 --> 00:35:05,114
所以平均值是我认为它转
so the mean squared is I think it turns

524
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,244
出为1以上s乘以C倍一个乙
out to be 1 over s times C times a B

525
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:12,794
在这个弗罗贝尼乌斯规范中，这就是它的平方
squared in this Frobenius norm it's it's

526
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:16,574
一个平方加B平方的东西
the a squared plus B squared stuff that

527
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:26,264
我以前见过这么好，所以我跳了
I saw before so okay so this I've jumped

528
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:32,824
从总和中获得一个重要的一步
a serious step to get from the sum

529
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:36,215
插入的方差的公式
formula for the variance I've plugged in

530
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,375
这个问题，现在好了
this problem and got that okay and now

531
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:50,114
我要抽样让我们看看它在哪里
I'm gonna sample let's see where it yeah

532
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,994
哦，我想要简化这个
oh I want I would like to simplify this

533
00:35:52,999 --> 00:36:02,744
我想简化一下，所以我有
I would like to simplify that so I have

534
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:06,014
插上PJ好吧所以我必须这样做
to plug in the PJs okay so I have to

535
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:09,645
插入那个PJ，我们决定了什么
plug in for that PJ and we decided what

536
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,105
PJ将会是
PJ was going to be

537
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:21,205
这里好了，所以当我插入的是在
here okay so when I plug that in in the

538
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:26,545
分母将取消其中一个
denominator it will cancel one of these

539
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:30,835
我只需要一个JPG的总和
and I'll just have a sum of a JPG of a

540
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:38,905
JPjbj规范和C是什么
JP j bj norms and what's that is C so

541
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,095
让我再说一遍吧
let me say this again just it's

542
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,505
你什么时候可以检查一下
something you can just check when you

543
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,485
插入那个值时有一分钟
have a minute when I plug in that value

544
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:53,695
对于PJ，它取消了正方形和
for PJ here it cancels the squares and

545
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,185
只留下第一个力量所以我就是
just leaves the first power so then I'm

546
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,945
加起来的第一个力量，我得到了C.
adding up the first power and I get C

547
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:06,955
但是PJ中有一个因子C.
and but the PJ had a factor C in the

548
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,625
分母，它在分母中
denominator and it's in the denominator

549
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,385
那边是C，所以它就在那里
over there so that C is up there so it's

550
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:18,555
C平方来到这里一个恒定的方格
C squared coming here a constant square

551
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,775
减去另一个词有1个超过s
minus the other term there's a 1 over s

552
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,535
这最终会消失，这
that will eventually go away and this

553
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:30,895
其他任期是1比s更多也许是
other term is 1 over s more maybe the

554
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,815
弗罗贝尼乌斯的规范很好，也许一个
Frobenius norm squared well maybe one

555
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:44,335
在SS上，所以你看到了我
over SS are so you're seeing and I

556
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,765
道歉
apologize

557
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:52,005
代数一点点凌乱位
a little bit messy bit of algebra a

558
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,475
有点凌乱的代数但是
little bit messy bit of algebra but

559
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,635
这就是我们最终的结果
that's what we that's what we ended up

560
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,905
当我们采取样品和时
with and when we take s samples and

561
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,475
结合它们将取消s和
combine them that will cancel the s and

562
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,655
我认为，当我们这样做时，它会敲出来
the I think it'll knock that out when we

563
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:20,895
结合s样品好吧好的
combine the s samples okay yeah okay

564
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:31,585
知道现在我们可以选择那些
know what now we get to choose those

565
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,915
概率以及我们将如何进行
probabilities and how are we gonna

566
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,895
选择他们什么是最好的选择
choose them what will be the best choice

567
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,995
这是方差的表达式
here's the expression for the variance

568
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,595
是的，这很好，这很好
yeah this is good this is good

569
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,845
从现在开始和你在一起，依靠你
stay with me from now on you you you

570
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:51,685
你会对自己说的
you'll be saying to yourself there's

571
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,015
那里的一些步骤，我没有完全看到
some steps there that I didn't see fully

572
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,675
我想检查但是我同意但是
and I want to check but and I agree but

573
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,345
让我说我们达到了这一点
let me say that we get to that point and

574
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:08,395
这是一个固定的数字，所以它是我们的C.
this is a fixed number so it's C that we

575
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,995
我想做小，这就是我们的
would like to make small and that's our

576
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,165
最后的工作这对任何选择都是如此
final job this was true for any choice

577
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:22,395
P的概率哦，是的，是的
of the probabilities P well oh yeah yep

578
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,645
是的，所以我想这仍然有
yep so I want to the this still had in

579
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:35,485
可能性是啊我在哪里
it the probabilities yeah where do I

580
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,345
我想要表明那些
want to do I want to show that those

581
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,035
这是最好的选择，这是
that was the best choice that this was

582
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,055
最好的选择，是的，我想表明这一点
the best choice yeah I want to show that

583
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,354
这是最佳选择
that's the best choice that's a choice

584
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:55,375
基于概率的概率权重
of weights of probabilities based on the

585
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,225
一段时间的长度是B的长度
length of a time's the length of B of

586
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,535
当然听起来不合理
course that sounds reasonable doesn't it

587
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,675
我们想要四个大的大柱子和大的
we want to four big big columns and big

588
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,355
我们想要更高的行
rows we want to have a higher

589
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,475
选择那些的概率，但是
probability to choose those but is the

590
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,545
概率与长度成正比
probability proportional to the length

591
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,385
两者都应该成比例
of both or should it be proportional to

592
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,845
10次​​幂或平方根或
the 10th power or the square root or

593
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:24,015
那是我们最后一步的结果
what that's what our final step of

594
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,905
优化P所以这是最后的
optimizing the P so this is the final

595
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,865
步
step

596
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:40,765
优化概率P1到PsI.
optimize the probabilities P 1 to P s I

597
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:45,745
猜测没有P1到PR的R行或
guess no P 1 to P R for the R rows or

598
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,375
a和我们的B行主题的列
columns of a and our rows of B subject

599
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,605
他们必须加起来为1，
to their you have to add up to 1 and

600
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,405
我的意思是优化是什么意思
what do I mean by optimize I mean

601
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:00,415
最小化这是优化手段
minimize this is optimize means

602
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:10,525
最小化这个表达C所以AJBJ
minimizing this expression C so AJ BJ

603
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:26,155
转移到哪里是PG的希望
transfer where's it's the over PG o hope

604
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,955
帮忙
help help

605
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,895
所以让我看到亚我已经方差
so let me just see ya my variance has

606
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,305
得到一个PJ是的，我的差异对不起我
got a PJ in it yeah my variance sorry my

607
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:47,325
方差哦，这是我的差异
variance oh okay this is my variance

608
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,605
如果我做对了，这就是结果
this is the result if I make the right

609
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:56,425
对，如果我做出这个选择的选择
choice for the if I make this choice for

610
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,545
概率，但我正在备份一个
the probabilities but I'm backing up a

611
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:05,025
分钟，这是，如果这是与
minute this is if this is the with

612
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,685
最佳
optimal

613
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,285
PJ然后我们得到了那么好的回答
PJ's then we got that answer great that

614
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,064
是我们的答案
was our answer

615
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:18,285
但我正在支持这个并说
but I'm backing up to this and saying

616
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,915
什么是最佳PJs
what are the optimal PJs for to make

617
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,275
这种差异很小，所以我才是真的
this variance small so I'm I'm really

618
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,175
我只是做着这样做，我让我
I'm just doing what doing this I let me

619
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,255
就在那里，问题更简单，最小化
right there the problem simpler minimize

620
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:44,635
一些豌豆等于一些
with the some of the peas equal one some

621
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,324
数量q平方超过QJ/PJ是的
quantity q squared over QJ / PJ yeah

622
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:59,515
那就是你怎么这些qJS那个
that's it how do you so these q JS that

623
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,705
我刚刚介绍了那封信
i just introduced that letter for are

624
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:07,195
AJBJ他们可能是他们的
the AJ B J's they're they're given maybe

625
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,844
我只是把AJPJ放回去了
I'll just put put back AJ PJ so to

626
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:14,965
重复这是计算
repeat this is the calculation of the

627
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:19,375
方差睡衣的任何选择，这是
variance for any choice of PJs this is

628
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,614
如果我做出最好的选择，我会得到什么
what I get if I make the best choice but

629
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,685
在这里我要告诉它是
over here I'm gonna show that it is the

630
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,905
最好的选择因为它是选择
best choice because that it's the choice

631
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,725
这使得这个结果小到了
that makes this result as small as

632
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,145
可能这就是Mulder的呻吟声
possible so that's the the groans Mulder

633
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,195
钳子方面所以我们有统计数据
plier aspect so we there statistics has

634
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,044
已经完成我得到了我得到这个
been done I'm get I'm getting this

635
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:44,785
回答而不是放入一些
answer and instead of putting in some

636
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,854
奇怪的Q让我把在这些是什么
weird Q let me put in what these are

637
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,844
他们不管他们是一群
they're whatever they're bunch of

638
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:56,715
数字，但我除以PJ和
numbers but I'm dividing by the PJ and

639
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,145
你怎么找到最好的PJ你知道吗？
how do you find the best PJ do you know

640
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:10,015
关于那个优化问题我他们
about that optimization question I they

641
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,854
必须添加到一个和Grouch有
have to add to one and the Grouch had

642
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,225
伟大的想法，所以这可能是
the great idea so this is maybe the

643
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,945
我们第一次使用他的想法，所以你
first time we've used his idea so do you

644
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,485
记得他的想法
remember what his idea

645
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,524
他接受了这个约束并且建立了
he takes this constraint and he builds

646
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,965
它成为他乘以它的函数
it into the function he multiplies it by

647
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,864
一些不为人知的神秘数字
some unknown mysterious number often

648
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:35,965
叫做lambda但与此毫无关系
called lambda but nothing to do with

649
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,304
的关注的特征值
eigenvalues of the concern of the

650
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,004
PI应该添加的约束
constraints that the PI's should add to

651
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:46,375
一个，所以他零，他有零，但有
one so he had zero he had zero but with

652
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,544
一个变量lambda，这是拉格朗日的
a variable lambda this is Lagrange's

653
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:54,175
想法所以这是它很整洁，这
idea so it's it's pretty neat that this

654
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,844
问题我离开了随机抽样
problem I've left randomized sampling

655
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:00,165
我到达了这个最后的子问题
I've arrived at this final subproblem

656
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,965
优化下的概率
optimizing the probabilities under the

657
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,794
条件，他们添加到一个和
condition that they add to one and

658
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:08,304
拉格朗日的想法是建立这个等式
Lagrange's idea was build that equation

659
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:12,235
进入功能然后你可以采取
into the function then you can take

660
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,354
衍生品，但你也采取
derivatives but you also take

661
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,304
关于λ的衍生物
derivatives with respect to lambda

662
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:21,114
因为现在这是一个未知的你和你
because that's now an unknown and you

663
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,395
解决你将导数设置为零
solve you set the derivatives to zero

664
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,364
你会得到答案就像一个
and you get the answer it's like a

665
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:30,625
奇迹，但如果你已经看到了地面
miracle but if you've seen the ground

666
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,534
这是一个令人困惑的奇迹就是它
it's a confusing miracle that's what it

667
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:36,534
是啊好吧，如果我走了
is yeah okay so if I take the

668
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:39,534
豌豆规格的衍生物
derivatives of the spec to the peas set

669
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:42,895
他们为零我认为我会得到
them to zero I think I'm going to get

670
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:49,064
推荐的豆豆让我这么做
the recommended Peas so that so I've

671
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:51,804
我用a计算了最终的答案
I've computed the final answer with a

672
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,725
推荐作品，但现在我要
recommended piece but now I'm going to

673
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,975
表明他们确实是这样推荐的
show that they really are recommended so

674
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,225
你可以采取的衍生
can you take the derivative of that with

675
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:02,334
尊重P，我可以提出这个问题
respect to P could I just raise this a

676
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,965
很少提高它好一点
little raise it a little more okay take

677
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,784
关于每个P的P的导数
the derivative with respect to P each P

678
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:11,544
因为我有未知数
because I've got n unknowns there are

679
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:15,024
然而，许多人可能都是未知数而且我已经知道了
however many maybe are unknowns and I've

680
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:17,334
得到lambda所以我有R加1件事
got lambda so I've got R plus 1 things

681
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,554
那么这个突破到P的衍生物是什么
so what's the derivative this break to P

682
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,334
行演算采取衍生物即
okay calculus take the derivative that

683
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:30,955
这是一个JVJ转换为减号
it's a J VJ transpose over with a minus

684
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,074
PJ正确
P J squared right

685
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,135
以及相关的衍生物
and the derivative of that with respect

686
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:43,474
到PJ是负lambda所以那是
to PJ is minus lambda so that's

687
00:46:43,479 --> 00:46:46,724
衍生出幽灵PJ是0和
derivative the specter PJ is 0 and the

688
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:49,304
导数，所以这是衍生物
derivative so this was the derivative

689
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:55,184
关于PJ必须是0然后
with respect to PJ has to be 0 and then

690
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:58,514
对lambda的衍生方面
the derivative respect to lambda into

691
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:06,314
尊重lambda就是JSJS减去
respect to lambda is that JS JS minus

692
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:12,464
等于1lagravis混淆了整体
equals 1 the lagravis confused the whole

693
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:17,474
世界，但他给了我们一个休息时间
world but he gave us a break that in the

694
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:19,304
只是衍生出幽灵lambda
derivative the specter lambda it just

695
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,524
因为他带回了约束
brings back the constraint because he

696
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:23,144
刚用lambda因子构建它
just built it in with a factor lambda

697
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:25,244
然后他拿出了衍生物而且它
then he took the derivative and it

698
00:47:25,249 --> 00:47:27,524
带回了约束但是这个
brought back the constraint but this

699
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:34,304
部分是美丽的部分，我现在做什么
part is the beautiful part now what do I

700
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:40,994
从中吸取教训，有时甚至有时
learn from that and sometimes sometimes

701
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:43,214
这将是一个加号，为什么我不这样做
this would be a plus why don't I make it

702
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:46,954
只是为了让我的生活更轻松
a plus just to make my life easier

703
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:49,484
勒布朗说现在已经死了，他没有
LeBron said it's dead now and he don't

704
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:52,875
无论如何都要关心它是否接近-好吧
care anyway whether it's closer on - ok

705
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,204
好的，所以这就是告诉我这个
ok so so this is telling me this so this

706
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,974
告诉我什么什么击中倍增
is telling me what what hits multiplier

707
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:03,794
是他告诉我，如果这个等式
is he's telling me that if this equation

708
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:10,594
告诉我乘数是AJ
is telling me that the multiplier is AJ

709
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:18,704
VJ转置/PJ平方或放另一个
VJ transpose / PJ squared or put another

710
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:25,294
他告诉我PJ平方的方式就是我
way he's telling me that PJ squared is I

711
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:28,694
猜猜我希望漂亮之后
guess I'm hoping that after the pretty

712
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:32,144
我们采取的令人困惑的步骤是一个
confusing steps that we took this is a

713
00:48:32,149 --> 00:48:35,984
用数学的单独一点点
separate a little bit of math using the

714
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:38,354
LaGrant适用或想法，我希望如此
LaGrant apply or an idea and I hope that

715
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:40,875
你的想法将是你的结果
your your result your thought will be

716
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,754
男孩很简单，所以我要去
boy that was pretty simple so I'm gonna

717
00:48:43,759 --> 00:48:46,334
把PJ平方是这里的车道
put the PJ Squared's here in the lane

718
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:53,555
好吧，这告诉我什么看
okay well what does this tell me look

719
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,535
我已经采取了衍生规范来
I've taken the derivative the spec to

720
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,875
PJ和我得到了每个的等式
the PJs and I got this equation for each

721
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,864
J但是我把导数部分拿走了
J but I took the derivative the partial

722
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,795
衍生物回到每个睡衣和
derivatives back to each of the PJs and

723
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:13,785
它告诉我PJ平了等一下
it tells me that PJ squared wait a

724
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,135
分钟什么是广场因此
minute what's the square and therefore

725
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:21,215
帮助我只有两分钟哦
help I've only got two minutes and oh

726
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,455
他们必须加一个哦是的lambdas
they have to add to one oh yeah lambdas

727
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,705
要救我们哈哈吧
gonna save us haha right

728
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,975
拉姆达是想救我们，因为
lambda is gonna save us because the

729
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,935
总概率所以PJ将是
total probabilities so PJ will be the

730
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:42,015
这个东西的平方根然后我
square root of this stuff and then I the

731
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,055
号码lambda我还没有决定
number lambda I haven't decided

732
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,114
拉格朗日乘数还没有决定这样
Lagrange's multiplier haven't decided so

733
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,425
它是什么才是正确的数字
what is it it's the correct number to

734
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,535
使这等于一，所以就是这样
make this equal to one so that's that is

735
00:49:53,540 --> 00:50:00,795
C哦天哪，我得到了平方根
the C oh god what have I got square root

736
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,165
我应该开始拍摄
there shoot I should have started with

737
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:11,015
方块所以这些应该是正方形啊
squares so these should be squares ah

738
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,665
谢谢
thank you

739
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:17,745
你可以告诉我早些时候使用的时候
you could have told me earlier use when

740
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,364
你看到有麻烦的教授没有
you see a professor in trouble don't

741
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:23,805
让我只是让他挂在那儿好吧
let's just let him hang there okay right

742
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:30,435
好吧，这是AJBJ所以除了
okay and this is AJ BJ so apart from the

743
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,465
kerfuffle在这里和笔记得到它
kerfuffle here and the notes get it

744
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,145
是的，因为我有时间在那里思考
right because I had time to think there

745
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:41,625
结果证明这一点
that it it turns out that

746
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,175
这个最优给出了公式
this optimum gave the formula for the

747
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,975
PJS我以前使用，所以当我
PJs that I used earlier so when I

748
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,925
介绍这个公式，我说让我们
introduced this formula I said let's

749
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,655
让我们选择那些概率
take let's choose those probabilities

750
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,205
但后来我回到了最后
but then I came back at the very end and

751
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,845
表明他们是概率
showed that they are the probabilities

752
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,115
这样可以最大限度地减少方差
that minimize the variance so that's

753
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,715
就像今天的讲座你能想到的那样
like today's lecture can you just think

754
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,255
一分钟，但请回去
a minute but please do go back through

755
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,335
笔记因为有些杂乱
the notes because there's some messy

756
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,845
我在那里的差异步骤
steps in the variance there that I had

757
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,085
快点过去，但你明白了
to go by quickly but you understand the

758
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,535
我们建立一个随机的原则
principle that we set up a randomized

759
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:31,075
系统我们选择概率瞄准
system we we choose probabilities aiming

760
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,105
获得最小的最好的
to get the the best the smallest

761
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,835
差异，事实证明，好
variance and it turns out that the good

762
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,645
列时的概率更大
probabilities are bigger when the column

763
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,165
是一个更大的列，以便使用
is a big a larger column so that to use

764
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,905
这你必须通过矩阵
this you have to go through the matrix

765
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,905
并找到列的长度
and find the lengths of the columns

766
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,295
因为那是告诉你的
because that's what's telling you the

767
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:54,145
概率所以这就像第一个
probabilities so that's a like a first

768
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,825
在你做之前通过
pass through before you do the

769
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,195
随机抽样你必须决定
randomized sampling you must decide on

770
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,185
概率和它们取决于
the probabilities and they depend on the

771
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,615
不同栏目的大小谢谢
sizes of the different columns thank you

772
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,935
让我通过，我会来
for getting me through that I'll come

773
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,975
回多一点关于随机
back to a little more about randomized

774
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,475
事情下次再往后不多
things next time and then later not much

775
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,305
但后来一点点后，我们会
later but a little bit later we'll be

776
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,450
seeing probability much more seriously

777
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:23,600
更加认真地看待概率

778
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,600
好的谢谢你
okay thank you
