00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,405
我们准备好了
so are we ready to go

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,135
关于18065的任何问题，所以它将如此
any questions on 1806 5 so it will be as

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,855
我之前说过线性的混合物
I said before a mixture of linear

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,585
代数和数学问题
algebra and math questions along with

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,965
在线使用这些材料，所以我在
online using the material ok so I'm in

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,035
这第一个星期或两个审查
this first week or two reviewing the

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,345
线性代数的亮点，我
highlights of linear algebra and I've

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,745
达到这一点要记得那么好
reached this point to remember well so

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,555
我刚才说了两句话
we I just said two words about

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,495
使用列乘以矩阵
multiplying matrices by using column

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,885
时间行作为一种方式来做到现在
times row as a as a way to do it and now

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,404
我想通过五个来说明这一点
I want to illustrate that by the five

21
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:24,435
矩阵的关键因子分解是可以的
key factorizations of matrices okay so

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,425
他们是什么，你认识他们
what are they and do you recognize them

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,135
事实上每个人都使用这些字母
everybody uses those letters in fact

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,895
这些字母中的一些像卢或
those some of those letters like lu or

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,955
QR将是最常用的matlab
QR would be the most used matlab

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,544
线性代数中的命令所以是四月路
commands in linear algebra so a April Lu

27
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,695
我可能会说一些我会发展的东西
I'll maybe say something I'll develop

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:54,055
今天，但它是关于消除
today but it's about elimination

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,845
求解线性系统，这样总是
solving linear systems so that's always

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,214
线性代数课程的开始但是
the start of a linear algebra course but

31
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,875
我会快速到这里，我只是想
I it will go fast here I just want to

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,114
告诉你一个不同的方式来到L
show you a different way to get to L

33
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,935
你将三角形时间降低到上部
times u lower triangular times upper

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,044
三角形可能你已经看过了
triangular probably you've seen that

35
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,255
那些三角矩阵你知道吗？
those triangular matrices so do you know

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,855
QR是关于这些方块的QR是什么
what QR is what's QR about these squares

37
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,514
是分解的重要应用
is the big application the factorization

38
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,945
那么什么样的矩阵才能得到它
so what kind of a matrix gets that

39
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,814
字母Q正交列
letter Q orthogonal the columns are

40
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,324
正交常常是正交的
orthogonal often orthonormal so

41
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,794
正交意味着它们是垂直的
orthogonal means they're perpendicular

42
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,615
彼此和/或正常的手段
to each other and or so normal means

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,655
它们是单位向量，所以就是这样
they're unit vectors so that that is so

44
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,835
所以Q经常代表一个矩阵
so Q often represents a matrix with

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,695
正交列，所以你我们可以
orthonormal columns so so you we could

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,984
如果你想记住，请说克施密特
say gram-schmidt if you want to remember

47
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:08,764
几个老人谁的
a couple of old-timers who whose

48
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,775
算法产生Q和R怎么样
algorithm produces Q and R how about

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,074
这个真的是中心的一个
this one this is really a central one in

50
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,035
数学纯数学应用数学无处不在
math pure math applied math everywhere

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,914
应用程序所以S代表对称
applications so S stands for symmetric

52
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,215
所以这是一个特殊的因素分析
so this is a special factorization for

53
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,125
对称矩阵，你可以看到
symmetric matrices and you can see that

54
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,854
它是对称的这个lambda是
it's symmetric this lambda is the

55
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:36,305
对角特征值矩阵总是lambda
diagonal eigenvalue matrix always lambda

56
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,344
对于4ighen值
for 4i ghen values

57
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,535
q当然就像那个q不同的q
q is like that q different q of course

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,085
那你可以找到一些公正的
that q you can find sort of just

59
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,785
从革兰氏施密特直截了当这
straight forward from gram-schmidt this

60
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,264
所涉及的具有特征向量，所以你
q involved has the eigenvectors so you

61
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,395
没有一些没有找到特征向量
don't find eigenvectors without some

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,624
额外的工作还可以，这就是特征向量
extra work okay so that's eigenvectors

63
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:04,504
是啊所以这将是值得推广等等
yeah so that would be worth expanding so

64
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,425
这里的特征向量
here are the eigenvectors of

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,525
他们在这里规范化了矩阵sn2
of the matrix sn2 them normalized here

66
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,794
是特征值lambda1到lambdan
are the eigenvalues lambda 1 to lambda n

67
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,245
现在这里是特征向量
and here are the eigenvectors now

68
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:26,555
换位好吧让我想起了
transposed okay so remind me of the

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,425
我猜一个关于两个事实的重大事实
great fact about two facts I guess one

70
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,155
其实关于特征值和一个事实
fact about the eigenvalues and one fact

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,855
关于特征向量这就像一个
about the eigenvectors this is like an

72
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,384
线性声明中的重要事实
important fact in a statement in linear

73
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,875
代数什么是我们所知道的
algebra what is what do we know about

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,065
特征向量哦，我想我是
the eigenvectors oh well i guess i'm

75
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,085
放弃它
giving it away

76
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,435
特征向量是正交的
the eigenvectors are orthogonal that's

77
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,145
很重要
very important

78
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,095
很好地制作一些矩阵
make some matrices well they're

79
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,795
美丽的矩阵他们是国王
beautiful matrices they're the kings of

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,335
线性代数Q是我的王后
linear algebra Q's are the queens in my

81
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,645
看来正交矩阵是
opinion orthogonal matrices are the

82
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,825
对称矩阵的皇后是
queens of symmetric matrices are the

83
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,974
国王所以这些都是正交的
king so so these are orthonormal

84
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,465
特征向量和关键点
eigenvectors and the key point an

85
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,255
这里暗示的重点是
important point that's implicit here is

86
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,835
他们中有n个是完整的
there are n of them there's a complete

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,955
设置矩阵可以对角化和
set the matrix can be diagonalized and

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,305
那些有关的特别之处
those well what's special about the

89
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,034
特征值其他矩阵可以是Q.
eigenvalues other matrices could be Q

90
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,245
lambdaQ转置但对称
lambda Q transpose but symmetric

91
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,914
矩阵是额外的东西
matrices are something additional about

92
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,634
拉姆达所以他们都真正使本征
lambda so they're all real so eigen

93
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,344
值是真实的，而特征向量是
values are real and eigen vectors are

94
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,045
正交可以选择正交
orthonormal can be chosen orthonormal

95
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,654
可以选择我只需说好了
can be chosen I just have to say okay

96
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,985
好的好哦现在也许我会用
good good good oh now maybe I'll use

97
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,565
作为矩阵的一个例子
that as an example of matrix

98
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,325
乘法，所以让我做
multiplication so let me just do that

99
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,175
这里简单的矩阵乘法但是
here simple matrix multiplications but

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,955
它使QlambdaQ成为重点
it makes the point so Q lambda Q

101
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,025
换位好吧我的观点是什么
transpose okay well what was my point

102
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,914
关于矩阵乘法让我成为
about matrix multiplication let me be

103
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,374
这真的涉及两个矩阵我
it really involved two matrices here I

104
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,115
不幸的是有三个，所以我会
unfortunately have three so I'm gonna

105
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,724
必须用其中一个来挤压lambda
have to squeeze lambda in with one of

106
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,605
这些立方体也很好地看作两个
the cubes too to see it nicely as two

107
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,805
矩阵，所以他们只是那样做那里
matrices so they just do that yeah there

108
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,895
现在我已经制作了两个很简单的矩阵
now I've made two matrices that was easy

109
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,485
好吧现在是什么规则和在
okay now what's the rule and in the

110
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,274
首先注意到这是一个，这是B
first notes this was a and this was B

111
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,214
当你乘以两个矩阵时
and when you multiply two matrices the

112
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:52,045
规则是这是Qlambda的列
rule is this is columns of Q lambda

113
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:59,944
时间行Q转置我是
times rows of Q transpose I'm

114
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,034
按行乘以列，所以它是
multiplying columns by rows and so it's

115
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,904
列向量乘以行向量和
a column vector times a row vector and

116
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:11,374
这给了我们一个矩阵，所以每个都是
that gives us a matrix so each and it's

117
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,985
这是一个特殊的矩阵
a special matrix what so this is a

118
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,305
列这是一行，当我乘以
column this is a row and when I multiply

119
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,244
n乘以1乘以n得到N乘n
n by 1 times 1 by n I get an N by n

120
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:24,694
矩阵，这是非常特殊和什么
matrix and it's pretty special and what

121
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,605
是我的一个特殊事实
is the special fact about I'm sort of

122
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,134
从上次回忆起
recalling from last time

123
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,534
列的时间有什么特别之处
what's special about a column times a

124
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,765
排它的等级是特殊的，它的等级是1
row it's rank is special it's rank is 1

125
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,205
它的所有列空间都是唯一的
it all its column space well the only

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,925
列周围是这一列所有列
column around is this one so all columns

127
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,735
所有行都是这个家伙的倍数
are multiples of this guy all rows are

128
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,245
我们可以看到这个家伙的倍数
multiples of this guy as we could see

129
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,194
从一个例子，他们只是做一个
from an example so they just do an

130
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,834
示例12次34随机取
example 1 2 times 3 4 to take a random

131
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,874
例如使得将给予我们3468
example so that would give us 3 4 6 8

132
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,524
我确信这些专栏是
I'm sure enough the columns are

133
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,884
1的倍数是行的倍数
multiples of 1 2 the rows are multiples

134
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,374
34和等级是1好等所以那些
of 3 4 and the rank is 1 okay so those

135
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:19,894
是我想要的构建块
are the building blocks now I want to

136
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:25,774
建立一些东西，所以我们去，所以这是
build something so here we go so this is

137
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,545
一些等级的总和
a sum of rank some

138
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:37,095
秩1的总和列时间排，所以我
of Rank 1 sum of column times row so I

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,545
第1列第1行是我的
take column 1 times Row 1 that's my

140
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,245
总和中的第一件事就是第1列
first thing in the sum so column 1 of

141
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,465
这让你看到我只好潜行
that so you see I had to sneak the

142
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,055
lambda结束只有两个因素
lambda end to have just just two factors

143
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,995
那么Qlambda的第1列是什么哦
so what's column 1 of Q lambda oh that's

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,985
一个好问题
a good question

145
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,385
所以Q的第1列是第1个Q1
so column 1 of Q is Q 1 the first

146
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,985
特征向量，但现在我正在乘以
eigenvector but now I I'm multiplying by

147
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,495
这个对角线矩阵你看到你的
this diagonal matrix do you see in your

148
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,555
记住Qlambda的第一列是什么
mind what's the first column of Q lambda

149
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,675
想想那一秒就这样吧
just think about that a second so here's

150
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,285
我们可以窃取任何小角落
we can steal any little corner for for

151
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,235
对于一个矩阵，所以这里是Q1和
for a matrix ok so here's Q 1 and the

152
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,455
其余的列然后在这里
rest of the columns and then here's

153
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,745
lambda1和那个Qlambda所以我是
lambda 1 and that's Q lambda so I'm

154
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,235
将这些放在一起，我问
putting those together and I'm asking

155
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,235
什么是答案的第一列
what's the first column of the answer

156
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,035
你看它是如何工作
and you see how that works

157
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,775
它是Q1lambda1恰好是lambda1
it's Q 1 lambda 1 exactly that lambda 1

158
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,655
将Q1乘以其他lambda
will multiply Q 1 these other lambdas

159
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,635
乘以后面的列，所以第一个
multiplied later columns so the first

160
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,605
列是λ-1次，Q1右所以
column is lambda 1 times Q 1 right so

161
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,985
那是第一个lambda1Q1的人
that's it's the first guy lambda 1 Q 1

162
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,275
然后第一行将是Q.
and then the first row of this will be Q

163
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,865
1转置那是我们的第一个人
1 transpose that's the first guy in our

164
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,885
N物的总和，让我把下一个
sum of N Things and let me put the next

165
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:18,125
一个在最后1拉姆达2Q2Q2
one in the last 1 lambda 2 Q 2 Q 2

166
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:28,855
转置和lambdanqnQN转置
transpose and lambda n qn QN transpose

167
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,835
这真的是一种很好的写作方式
that's really a nice way to write to

168
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,185
分解产品QlambdaQ.
break up the product Q lambda Q

169
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,585
转置这称为谱
transpose this is called the spectral

170
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,365
定理，这是对称的s
theorem so that's the symmetric that's s

171
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,295
那就是那样的
that's s there is that so that's the

172
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,485
我们已经分成了一个等级
we've broken up s into rank one pieces

173
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,205
这就像一个不变的主题和
that's that's like a constant theme and

174
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,325
这些写一件很特别
these write one pieces are quite special

175
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,565
因为它们是对称的Q1Q1
because they're symmetric Q 1 Q 1

176
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,155
转置将是对称的哦哦
transpose will be symmetric and oh so

177
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,395
我们可以这么说吧
can we so so let's just

178
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,165
我遵循乘法规则
I follow the rule for multiplying

179
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,595
矩阵，但也许我可以检查
matrices but maybe I could just check

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,825
这就是它来到了正确的事情
that it's the right thing that it came

181
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,605
对了，所以我的意思是通过检查
out right so what do I mean by checking

182
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,865
我想我只会检查一下Q次
I guess I'll just check about s times Q

183
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:35,305
1这样看，如果这件事情倍
1 so look at if this thing times the

184
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,055
第一个特征向量，我得到了什么
first eigenvector and what do I get

185
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,285
好的，所以你会喜欢这个，所以我有
ok so you'll like this so there's I've

186
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,215
分裂s转换的等级1片之和
split up s into a sum of Rank 1 pieces

187
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,675
分裂是你看到了一切
and that splitting is you see it all

188
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,415
它真的告诉你什么
over it's really showing you what the

189
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,815
对称矩阵的碎片是和
pieces of the symmetric matrix are and

190
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,185
现在我要检查那是不是
now I'm just gonna check that that's a

191
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,875
正确的s公式正确，所以我会
correct correct formula for s so I'll

192
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,425
将它乘以Q1，我希望得到
multiply it by Q 1 and I'm hoping to get

193
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,585
正确的事，我实际上是什么
the right thing and what do I actually

194
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,875
如果我成倍增加这整个业务
get if I multiply this whole business

195
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:19,375
次Q1我得到lambda1Q1Q1
times Q 1 I get lambda 1 Q 1 Q 1

196
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,015
转移那是第一个人的时代
transpose that's the first guy times by

197
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,195
Q1加右我将它乘以Q.
Q 1 plus right I'm multiplying this by Q

198
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,675
1，这第一个词给了我那个和
1 and this first term gave me that and

199
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,415
什么是下学期给我放放
what does the next term give me put put

200
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,045
我出于我的痛苦，这就是我
me out of my misery here it's uh I'm

201
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,355
寻找这个简化的东西
looking for this thing to simplify like

202
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,265
疯了，那么第二个任期是什么时候
mad okay so what's the second term when

203
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,655
我
I'm

204
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,074
通过q1供给这个家伙我得到什么零
supply this guy by q1 what do I get zero

205
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,685
这是正确的，这是我们想要的和
that's right that's what we want and

206
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:57,024
当我把最后一个人乘以q1时，我得到了
when I multiply the last guy by q1 I get

207
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,314
因为Q是正交所以这个
0 because the Q's are orthogonal so this

208
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,184
就是我得到的
is all I get

209
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,764
然后我不需要这个加号
and then so I don't need this plus

210
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,514
这就是它，然后我能做些什么
anymore that's it and then what can I do

211
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,735
以改进或者是一点点
to improve that or is that a little

212
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,644
有点重复的公式
somewhat repetitive formula for the

213
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,675
回答我最后想做什么
answer what do I want to do finally I

214
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,095
想要记住Q是
want to remember that the Q's are

215
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,434
归一化他们的单位向量那么
normalized their unit vectors so what

216
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,535
确实，在这里告诉我一个主
does that tell me here to one principal

217
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,615
q1转置时间Q1这就是什么
q1 transpose times Q 1 this is just what

218
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,704
它就是这样，这就是规范化意味着什么
it sits so that's what normalized means

219
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:40,605
长度的平方是长度
that the length squared is the length

220
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,245
矢量平方的长度和
the length of the vector squared and

221
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,954
它是1所以我可以取消那个词而且我是
it's 1 so I can cancel that term and I'm

222
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,814
得到正确的答案，这就是我
getting the right answer that's all I

223
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:54,235
所有这一切都与我有关
that's all this was about I was just

224
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,375
检查并想看看它会如何
checking and wanted to see how it would

225
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,384
掉下来和它属于正确的是
fall out and it falls right out that

226
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:07,165
这个公式是正确的矩阵
this formula is the correct matrix s

227
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,555
因为它有正确的特征向量
because it's got the right eigenvectors

228
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,745
qs，它有正确的特征值
qs and it's got the right eigenvalues

229
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,995
lambda所以它必须是正确的
lambda so it's got to be the right

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,434
矩阵是的，这就像一个
matrix yes is that ok that's a like a

231
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:28,944
第一个例子看看这个如何分裂
first example to see how this splitting

232
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,965
进入排名，让你回到你的身上
into rank ones gives you back what you

233
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,324
期待足够的它给你
expect easily enough it gives you the

234
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:39,024
信息您预计好了，这就是
information you expect okay so that's

235
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:44,124
对称特征值图片
the symmetric eigen value picture for

236
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:46,405
对称矩阵，我们会看到它
symmetric matrices and we'll see it

237
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,684
再次，这五个都很好
again it's it's well all five of these

238
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:54,894
很重要我不知道是否重要
are big are important I don't know if

239
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,315
你知道这个
you know this

240
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,955
但它将成为一个基础
but it's going to be a foundational

241
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,455
分解这门课程和
factorization for this course and for

242
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,855
所有的数据科学你知道吗？
all of data science do you know it's

243
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,945
如此命名首先是什么意思
named so what does it mean first of all

244
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,065
只是对此进行评论然后
just just a comment on this and then

245
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,455
我们会把它保存几个星期
we'll save it for a couple of weeks so

246
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,305
这个U实际上是一个正交矩阵
this U is actually an orthogonal matrix

247
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,965
V也是如此，它有两个
and so is V so it has it has two

248
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,385
正交矩阵这就是人们的原因
orthogonal matrices so that's why people

249
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,985
称他们为U和V而不是q1和
called them U and V rather than q1 and

250
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,435
q2就像太多了
q2 which was like too much just get

251
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,825
下标如此正交对角线
subscripts so orthogonal times diagonal

252
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,315
时间正交让我说正交
times orthogonal let me say orthogonal

253
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,085
对角线或声波图和1806将作为
diagonal or sonogram and 1806 would as

254
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,445
现在达到这个主题因为它是
of now reach this topic because it's

255
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,455
跳起来的重要性，它被称为
jumped up in importance and it's called

256
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,995
奇异值分解以及那些
singular value decomposition well those

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,625
很长的单词或每个人都称它为
are long words or everybody calls it the

258
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,965
SVD奇异值分解
SVD the singular value decomposition

259
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:13,205
重点是它的工作原理
the point is it's it's the it works for

260
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,385
每个矩阵矩形矩阵
every matrix rectangular matrices

261
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,905
它没有足够的问题
there's no issue of does it have enough

262
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,855
特征向量与否这是一个问题
eigenvectors or not that's an issue here

263
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,015
这不是每个矩阵都是一个问题
well it's an issue here not every matrix

264
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,985
有足够的特征向量来做到这一点
has got enough eigenvectors to make that

265
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:34,765
为每个工作的矩阵工作，因为
work every matrix that one works because

266
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,985
而不是一组特征向量
instead of one set of eigenvectors it's

267
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,075
得到两个矩阵两个不同的集合
got two matrices two different sets of

268
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,525
奇异向量哦，我们会我们会看到，
singular vectors oh we'll we'll see that

269
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,245
这一点很重要没关系
that's that's important okay

270
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,455
所以这真的很快
so that's a that's really a quick

271
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,475
基本因素分析的概述
overview of fundamental factorizations

272
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,645
而且我想再说一句话
and I'd like to say just another word

273
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,074
关于消除一个平等的然后
about elimination a equal Lu and then

274
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,834
我们会离开它息事宁人
we'll leave it leave it alone

275
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,264
所以消除是的，你还记得吗？
so elimination yeah do you remember that

276
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:19,544
首先是线性的开始
that first the beginning of linear

277
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:21,824
当你解决ax等于B时的代数
algebra when you're solving ax equal B

278
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,225
你做这些行操作
you do these row operations

279
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,564
我可以说我想说的就是全部
can I just what I want to say is all

280
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,894
那些你操作的行操作
those row operations that you that you

281
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:34,095
L次U完美表达了
do are perfectly expressed by L times U

282
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,825
所以这是1806年的一个关键点
and so that that's a key point in 1806

283
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,705
但我有不同的方式来看待它
but I have a different way to look at it

284
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,114
这就是我想告诉你的
so that's what I wanted to show you I

285
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,585
有一个我想告诉你一个等级的总和
have a I want to show you a sum of rank

286
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,975
它适合的是一个行时间列
one's a row times column it fits in

287
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,435
今天所以我只是想知道为什么
today so so I just like to see why does

288
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,014
矩阵可逆这是一个正方形
a matrix invertible this is a square

289
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:08,414
矩阵现在和可逆的因素
matrix now and invertible and it factors

290
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,355
如果一切顺利的消除和
if all goes well with elimination and

291
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,825
枢轴非零
the pivots are nonzero

292
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,065
它会影响较低的三角形时间
it factors into lower triangular times

293
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,855
上三角，这是关键的一步
upper triangular so that's a key step

294
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,494
这就是MATLAB会做的事情
that that is that MATLAB would do with

295
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:24,585
lvo事件会产生这两个
lvo event would produce those two

296
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:31,085
现在因素我想在一个
factors now I want to do them in a

297
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,085
列时间排的方式我只是
column times row way which I just

298
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,894
意识到很晚才有一个整洁的方式
realized late was there was a neat way

299
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:44,744
要做到这一点，我可以采取矩阵，做
to do it so can I take a matrix and do

300
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:49,095
消除我的矩阵有多大
elimination how big a matrix shall I

301
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,455
拿两个你说你三个
take two by two you say you three by

302
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,554
三个人完全不相信
three somebody not convinced totally by

303
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,335
两两
two by two

304
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,855
让我两个一个地做，然后如果你
let me do it two by two and then if you

305
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,595
想要，如果你真的想要一个三乘三
want if you really want a three by three

306
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,284
黄色，我会这样做，这是两个两个
yellow I'll do it okay here's two by two

307
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:17,205
两个四个三七怎么样就可以了
two four three seven how's that okay so

308
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,205
什么是耶，所以让我们记住什么
what is yeah so let's remember what

309
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,975
消除确实
elimination does

310
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,644
它从中减去该行的倍数
it subtracts a multiple of that row from

311
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:34,624
那一个得到两到三个和
that one to get two to three and the

312
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,634
多是二，因此挖空
multiple is two so it knocks out the

313
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:40,054
四个两三或六个所以它留下1
four two threes or six so it leaves a 1

314
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,654
我们是哦，是的，谢谢你允许我
and we're oh yeah thanks for allowing me

315
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:44,794
做两个两个
to do two by two

316
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,804
我已经完成了，我已经达到了
I've already done it now I've reached

317
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:51,185
你是这样的，这是你的上层
you so here's a and here's you the upper

318
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,855
三角形的家伙与枢轴上
triangular guy with the pivots on the

319
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:00,355
对角好，然后问题是
diagonal good and then the question is

320
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,185
用矩阵语言表达那一步
express that step in matrix language and

321
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,725
正确答案是L次你所以
the right answer is L times u so the

322
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,095
正确的答案是，这是一个
right answer is that this that this a is

323
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,085
所以我会删掉那封U是L的字母
so I'll just erase that letter U is L

324
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,154
你是什​​么LL所以LL更低
times u so what is L L is the lower

325
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,935
三角形的家伙，它有它
triangular guy and it has there the

326
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,044
你在这里使用过的数字是什么
number that you used here and what was

327
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,435
我减去了那一行中的两行
that I subtracted two of that row from

328
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:45,965
这让我想有这样就会
this so I wanted to there so that would

329
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,855
我会称之为乘数我
be I would call that a multiplier I

330
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,935
乘行一个由两个中减去
multiplied Row one by two subtracted to

331
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,654
得到零和两个两个
get that zero and for a two by two

332
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,475
例子我现在完成好了我想要的
example I was finished okay now I want

333
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,164
看到这所以有L次ü什么
to see this so there's L times U what

334
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:06,845
发生了我想看看L次
happened I would like to see how L times

335
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,075
你从这一行出来一列时间
u comes out of this row a column times

336
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,254
因此让我开始让我再想一想
row so let me start let me think again

337
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,605
真正的重点是什么呢
what so the really the point of

338
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,664
消除我们为什么这样做的原因
elimination what was why did we do this

339
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:25,745
首先
in the first place

340
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,534
因为在这里我们有两个耦合
because here we had two coupled

341
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,445
方程式他们是我们的一对夫妇
equations they were a couple together we

342
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,414
无法立即解决这一步
couldn't solve them instantly that step

343
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,795
消除
of elimination

344
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,245
在这个角落给我两个下来
juice me two down here in this corner

345
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,205
一个方程式，我已经消除了
one equation that I've eliminated the

346
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,075
第一个未知的X来自第二个等式
first unknown X from the second equation

347
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,255
所以第二个等式是零X加1
so the second equation is zero X plus 1

348
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,255
y等于右手边，我解决了
y equal right hand side and I solve it

349
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,355
马上好的
immediately okay

350
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,665
那我是怎么一个接一个的呢
so how did I get to that one by one

351
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,065
这些家伙的问题删除得很好
problem with these guys removed well

352
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,975
是的，我可以在这里写下我的
yeah just right can I write here the my

353
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,805
通过并行方式把它在两份
parallel way to think of it in it two by

354
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,475
两个很小我承认没关系
two is pretty small I admit okay

355
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,295
所以我开始用两个三四七我
so I start with two three four seven I

356
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,325
我希望将它分成两部分
want to split it in two I want to get

357
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,995
第一行和第一列
the first row and column in one piece

358
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,925
东西去了另一块
something goes there and the other piece

359
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,535
东西有好
is something there okay

360
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,815
这就是淘汰做了什么
that's what elimination has done it's

361
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,815
采取原始矩阵分裂
taken the original matrix its splitted

362
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:54,695
这些都是排名第一，所以我们只是
these are both ranked one so let's just

363
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,095
首先你可以告诉我发生了什么
first of all you could tell me what goes

364
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,785
在第一级的那个空白区域
in that blank space in the first rank

365
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,665
一个矩阵所以我可以这样说
one matrix so what can I say this in

366
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,045
消除第一阶段的话
words the first stage of elimination

367
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:13,205
脱离一个是一个很大的矩阵
pulls off from a so a is some big matrix

368
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,465
从它考虑到它拉出来
it pulls off from a it takes account of

369
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,625
第一列和第一列就这样吧
the first column and row so it it it

370
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:32,125
在这里写一个我们作为第一列
writes a as here we go as a first column

371
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:39,245
说第1列第1行加上简单
say column 1 Row 1 plus plus the easy

372
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,075
部分简单部分将是一个矩阵
part the easy part will be a matrix with

373
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,525
那里全零，哦，这里和那里零
all zeros there Oh zeroes there and here

374
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,985
我有一个2
I have a 2

375
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:55,105
我可以称之为-这是我现在的方式
can I call it a - this is my way now to

376
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,835
想想消除真的是什么
think about what elimination is really

377
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,024
这样做是从N到n开始的
doing it's starting with an N by n

378
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:02,965
矩阵它排名第一
matrix it's pulling off a rank one

379
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,745
获得该列的矩阵
matrix which has gets that column and

380
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,284
那行是正确的，它得到了它
that row correct and it gets whatever it

381
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:13,255
在这里，然后剩下的是什么
has in here and then the rest of what's

382
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,575
在那里-你看到我们已经完成了
in there is a - you see that we've done

383
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,414
这里第一步得到了第一步
that here the first step got the first

384
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,935
行和列是正确的，如果它是排名
row and column correct and if it's rank

385
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,935
一个数字是六六和六
one what number goes there six six and

386
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,154
那么剩下这就是我们
then this is the rest this is what we

387
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,115
有一个小尺寸的工作和它
have one size smaller to work on and it

388
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,085
看起来已经是七六了
looks like it was seven six has been

389
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:49,225
使用它是一个我真正想要的
used so it's a one that's really I want

390
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,465
认为这秩一个矩阵作为的
to think of this rank one matrix as the

391
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,635
的第一行L次的第一列
first column of L times the first row of

392
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,585
你和那个家伙是第二列
U and then this guy is the second column

393
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:11,965
L次第二排U我没事
of L times the second row of U I'm okay

394
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:17,185
我还没有提出这方面的证据在
I haven't presented this proof in the

395
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,414
之前和之前的课程是两个一个的
class before and for two-by-two it's

396
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,935
对我来说看起来有点矫枉过正，我的意思是
looking like overkill to me I mean like

397
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,125
为什么你不必做那么深的事
why you don't have to do all that deep

398
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,654
想要得到碎片，但我的
thinking to get to get pieces but my

399
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,825
想法是它给出了细分和
idea is that it gives the breakdown and

400
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,205
这当然是我们的专栏时间
this of course is by our column times

401
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,914
行规则是Lu所以我们就是这样
row rule that's Lu so we're we're

402
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,455
开始和我们打破它
starting with a and we're breaking it up

403
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,865
入路，其中路的第一块路的
into Lu where Lu the first piece of Lu

404
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,274
是第一列时间然后是行
is the first column times row and then

405
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:59,575
接下来的部分是剩下的部分
the next pieces are the rest of the

406
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,605
矩阵
matrix

407
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,935
虽然在下一个被打破了
and though was get broken down the next

408
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,215
如果我，消除的阶段会破裂
stage of elimination would break if I

409
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,515
这个阶段有一个3x3的剥离了
had a 3x3 this stage peeled off the

410
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,485
行中的第一列然后是下一阶段
first column in row then the next stage

411
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,695
将剥离第二个新的第二个
would peel off the second the new second

412
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,275
行和第三阶段的列
column in row and the third stage would

413
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,485
在排第三列就在去年
have the third column in rows just last

414
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,035
pivot对你有意义
pivot does this make any sense to you

415
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,185
你可以给我发电子邮件，并说它不是那样的
you could email me and say it's not that

416
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:34,505
很棒，但我认为这是看到的
great but I think it's to see that the

417
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,414
消除的最终结果是L次U.
final result of elimination is L times U

418
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:44,205
是不是有一点魔力呢？
is it's there's a little magic in in

419
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,825
看看你在做什么，我想
seeing what you're doing and I think

420
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,955
这是一种了解你正在做什么的方法
this is a way to see what you're doing

421
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,945
你是第一个剥离的人
that you're you're peeling off a first

422
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,815
部分留下第二部分
part to leave a second part like that

423
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,645
然后第二部分你会剥离
then the second part you would peel off

424
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,085
第二列乘以第二行
the second column times the second row

425
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,155
可以通过枢轴来划分它
may be divided by the pivot to make it

426
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,095
这是正确的，那将是
correct and that would that would put

427
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,775
在盒子的其余部分和
something in the rest of the box and

428
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,914
然后三个将是剩下的
then a three would be the rest of that

429
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,015
盒子好吧我在这里停下来我很高兴你
box okay I'm stopping here I'm glad you

430
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,765
让我做2x2因为我看到3x3会
let me do 2x2 since I see that 3x3 would

431
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,025
它会毁了一天呀还好一
it would have ruined the day yeah okay a

432
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,585
问题还是让我停下来一分钟，以便
question or let me pause for a minute so

433
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,135
我已经谈过这些因素
I've talked about these factorizations

434
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,865
这一次，我们不会再看到这一块我们
this one we won't see again this one we

435
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,885
我们会看到很棒的时间
will see big-time and this one we will

436
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,825
而这一个我们会，是的，是的
and this one we will yeah yeah

437
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,335
235是我们真正的那些
2 3 & 5 are the ones that we're really

438
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,725
会看到很多问题或想法
gonna see a lot of questions or thoughts

439
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,164
或者好吧我想我现在想告诉你
or okay I guess I want to tell you now

440
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:01,785
完成今天的前进
to complete today's moving forward in

441
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,275
这个问题的基本定理
this subject the fundamental theorem of

442
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,035
线性代数的基本定理
linear algebra the fundamental theorem

443
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,695
线性代数的好做好准备或
of linear algebra okay ready for that or

444
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,735
你可能已经看过了，因为
you may have seen it already because

445
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,285
它像的亮点
it's like the highlight of

446
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,665
这个主题的基本思想
of this subject of the basic ideas in

447
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,665
这个主题是正确的，然后也许我可以
this subject right and then maybe I can

448
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:28,875
之后我会告诉你那个定理的人
after I'd tell you that theorem people

449
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,375
世界各地给我发作作业
around the world send me homework

450
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,975
现在要做的问题你会想到任何问题
problems to do now you would think any

451
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,195
明智的教授永远不会那样做
sensible professor would never do those

452
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,115
他会说这是你的问题
problems like he would say it's your

453
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,265
问题，但我被带走了，我
problem but I get carried away and I

454
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,145
有时解决它们
solve them sometimes

455
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,325
所以一个人来自印度上周
so one came from India last week and it

456
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,215
涉及到基本定理
involved the fundamental theorem of

457
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,585
线性代数谁在那里教它
linear algebra whoever teaching it there

458
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,395
真的是在球上，我会
really was on on the ball and well I'll

459
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,975
之后告诉你那个问题
tell you that problem after after the

460
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,735
基本定理没关系
fundamental theorem okay

461
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:07,365
基本定理它大约四个
fundamental theorem it's about four

462
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,445
子空间所以我发明了四个名字
subspaces so I invented the name four

463
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,595
基本子空间，所以我可以列出
fundamental subspaces so can i list the

464
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:21,165
四个子空间基本基础我们
four subspaces fundamental basis well we

465
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,405
知道其中一个已经是专栏
know one of them already the column

466
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:30,195
空间所以对于矩阵我们给了一个
space so for a matrix we're given a

467
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,905
矩阵a表示M在等级R的末尾
matrix a that's M by end of rank R

468
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,225
这是我们的正常开始
that's our that's our normal starting

469
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,745
那么那四个子空间是什么呢？
point so what are those four subspaces

470
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,905
它们是如何相关的以及它们是什么相关的
and how are they related and what's

471
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,755
他们的维度和那些是什么
their dimension and what what those a

472
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,655
关键事实好吧我们已经知道了专栏
key fact okay we already know the column

473
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:02,745
矩阵的空间列空间和
space column space of the matrix and

474
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,055
实际上我们已经知道了行空间
actually we already know the row space

475
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,165
矩阵，我们有记号的
of a matrix and we have the notation for

476
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,845
转置的列空间和
that column space of a transpose and

477
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,725
什么是维度，所以这是
what is the dimension so that was the

478
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,585
任何人都在第一讲的关键点
key point in the first lecture anybody

479
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,685
谁错过了第一堂课应该去
who missed the first lecture should go

480
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:28,105
回到一点一点的笔记
back to the notes of one point one

481
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,774
对于该进入的思考
for the for the thinking that goes into

482
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:37,294
维度等于那些维度
the dimension equals what which of those

483
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:39,904
我想要的三个数字是
three numbers do I want to is the

484
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:44,495
列空间的维数是或和
dimension of the column space are or and

485
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,774
我能马上说些什么呢
what can I say about our right away

486
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:52,174
与M＆M相比，是的还是相等或者
compared to M&M yeah less or equal or

487
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:55,264
我能不能拥有更多的独立性
could I couldn't have more independent

488
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:59,255
列比我有列所以我有
columns than I have columns so I've got

489
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,424
n列，所以我们他们的
n columns so our our of them are

490
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,815
独立，所以我们在某个地方更少或
independent so our is somewhere less or

491
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,514
等于希望等于n
equal hopefully equal to n what about

492
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,794
行空间的维数有多少
the dimension of the row space how many

493
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,784
矩阵得到我们的独立行
independent rows as the matrix got our

494
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:21,085
谢谢你，这是一个伟大的事实
thank you that's that's the great fact

495
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,605
新证明减少了部分时间
with a new proof less time in section

496
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,764
1.1那些具有相同的维度
1.1 that those have the same dimension

497
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:32,105
相同的尺寸，你知道它
same dimension which is you know it's

498
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,044
你认为你看一个简单的好吧
you think okay you look at a simple

499
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,044
例如，这是真的，但你知道你是否
example it's true but you know if you if

500
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:39,965
你给了一个50的矩阵
you're given a matrix that's fifty by

501
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,605
百真正的事实，那些
hundred really the fact that those

502
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,245
百柱有相同数量的
hundred columns have the same number of

503
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,274
独立的那些50行
independent ones as those 50 rows that's

504
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,815
那个好像现在好了另一个
that's like great okay now the other

505
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,445
空格是矩阵的零空间
spaces are the null space of the matrix

506
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:05,195
在a和只是为了做一切
in of a and just to make everything

507
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,865
自然对称a的零空间
naturally symmetric a null space of a

508
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:16,835
转置那些是最后两个
transpose those are the last two those

509
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,195
是四个基本子空间
are the four fundamental subspaces which

510
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,875
你已经看过了，他们甚至都在
you've seen and they're even on the

511
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,455
线性代数教科书的封面
cover of the linear algebra textbook

512
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,245
好吧那么什么是零空间
okay so what's the null space

513
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,375
ax的解集等于零
the set of solutions to ax equals zero

514
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:44,865
权没有空间，所有的解决方案砍掉
right no space is all solutions to ax

515
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,965
等于e所以null空间有向量
equals e so the null space has vector

516
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,825
这些向量在XS中为零空间
these vectors in the XS the null space

517
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,855
不是从矩阵中取出的
isn't taken from the matrix the row of

518
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,715
列空间中的行空间
the row space in the column space those

519
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,205
这些数字都在矩阵中
those numbers are sitting in the matrix

520
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,654
null的空格和空格
the null space and the null space of a

521
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,815
transpose是null这个词的解决方案
transpose are solutions to the word null

522
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,975
反映出这是一个事实
is reflecting the fact that that's a

523
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,215
零，这就是它成为一个空间的原因
zero and that's what makes it a space

524
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,575
现在你可以让我问你
now can you just let me just ask you to

525
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,725
再想一想我说的时候隐含着什么
think again what's implied when I say

526
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,174
当我使用空间这个词的时候
when I use the word space a space of

527
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:30,525
矢量我可以添加是的
vectors I can add yeah

528
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:35,865
所以你我可以做最重要的事情
so so you I can do the most important

529
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,294
在该线性代数的操作
operations of linear algebra in that

530
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,715
我可以在这里添加两个向量让我
space I can add two vectors here let me

531
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,565
只需添加它们，所以在这里我将有一个向量
just add them so here I'll have a vector

532
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,475
X，让我再说一个a
X and let me say another another one a

533
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,745
矢量Y然后我做我另外跟着
vector Y then I do addition I follow the

534
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,525
规则我看到这可以写成
rules I see that this can be written as

535
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,154
斧子加y是零加零，因此你有什么
ax plus y is zero plus zero so what have

536
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,955
我知道如果X在，我已经知道了
I learned I've learned that if X is in

537
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,144
null空格和Y在null中
the null space and Y is in the null

538
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:11,594
空格然后X加y所以空格是
space then X plus y so the null space is

539
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,134
正如你所说的那样，我不去
as you said closed meaning I don't go

540
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,285
如果X在其中并且Y在其中，则在它之外
outside it if X is in it and Y is in it

541
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,795
然后总和在它和类似地从
then the sum is in it and similarly from

542
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,295
斧头等于零我得到一个C时代X
ax equals zero I get to a times C x

543
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,955
等于零
equals zero

544
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,515
它只是乘以C乘以C
it's just multiplied by C by a number C

545
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,354
那么这两个事实就意味着我可以
so those two facts that that means I can

546
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,505
做线性代数我可以乘
do linear algebra I can multiply by

547
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,624
数字，我可以添加换句话说我
numbers and I can add in other words I

548
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:42,465
可以采取
can take

549
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,834
线性组合就是你做的
linear combinations that's what you do

550
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,314
与向量和点是如果我这样做
with vectors and the point is if i do it

551
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,374
如果我采用两个零空间的组合
if i take combinations of two null space

552
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:56,414
球员我仍然在零空间好了，
guys I'm still in the null space okay so

553
00:34:56,419 --> 00:35:03,485
这就是零空间的重点
that's the point of the null space and

554
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,405
现在好了，现在是基础的一部分
well now so now part of the fundamental

555
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,905
定理是要弄清楚有多少
theorem is to figure out how many

556
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,045
独立向量在null中
independent vectors are in the null

557
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,765
空间有多少独立解决方案
space how many solutions independent

558
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,405
解决方案做了那个方程组
solutions does that system of equations

559
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,125
有这么那将是维和我
have so that'll be the dimension and I

560
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,604
要问你什么是让我画
have to ask you what it is let me draw a

561
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:27,435
在你想到的时候想象一下
picture while you're thinking about

562
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,195
这些空间是梦幻般的有
those spaces it's fantastic to have

563
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,344
这些美丽干净的板好了，
these beautiful clean boards okay so

564
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:44,205
这是我的行空间行的图片
here's my picture of the row space rows

565
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,195
这是转置的列空间
that's the column space of a transpose

566
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,285
这是我的零空间图片
and here's my picture of the null space

567
00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:00,074
一个，这是斧头的解决方案
of a and that's the solutions to ax

568
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,415
等于零，为什么我把这两个
equals zero and why have I put these two

569
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,225
和这两个在一起这样的
together and these two together so the

570
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:14,925
另一对将是列空间C
other pair will be the column space C of

571
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:26,594
转置的a和null空间就在那里
a and null space of a transpose so there

572
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,215
是他们的四个空间
are the four spaces where their

573
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,834
关系是基本定理
relationship is the fundamental theorem

574
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:39,844
线性代数所以首先是什么
of linear algebra so first of all what

575
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:45,975
对不起，所以我有一个M乘n矩阵
sorry so I have an M by n matrix so that

576
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,574
告诉我，我的行是一个典型的行
tells me that my rows a typical row has

577
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:52,395
n组件对我看一个Mbyn
n components right I look at an M by n

578
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,415
矩阵让我们做吧2×3
matrix let's do it two by three

579
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:02,725
矩阵，所以如果我看行空间
matrix so if I look at the row space

580
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,535
这是M，这是n所以我看到了
this is M and this is n so so I see

581
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,485
三个行具有长度3和
three the rows have length three and of

582
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,304
当然他们也乘以X的
course they multiply the X's which also

583
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:19,475
长度为3X1X2X3这就是原因
has length 3 X 1 X 2 X 3 that's why

584
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,364
这些都在一起，因为它们都是
these are together because they're both

585
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:29,584
在n维空间然后为什么
in n-dimensional space then why are

586
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:34,205
这些因为列是
these together because the columns are

587
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,785
在二维空间中
in two dimensional space for this

588
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,525
示例和转置的零空间
example and null space of a transpose

589
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:46,145
只是像y1y这两个组成部分
would be just two components like y 1 y

590
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,435
2给零，所以你看到这个
2 to give zeros so do you see that this

591
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,844
是这些人在RN
is are these guys are in RN

592
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,455
所以这是第一个喜欢得到的东西
so that's the first like get things

593
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:07,165
在RM2的RN2空间中直接2个空格
straight 2 spaces in RN 2 spaces in RM

594
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,625
那么接下来我要问的是什么
now then what am I going to ask about

595
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,804
这些空间我想我已经开始了
these spaces I guess I already started

596
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:16,025
询问并没有等待答案
asking and didn't wait for an answer

597
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,905
它们的尺寸因此具有尺寸R.
their dimension so this has dimension R

598
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:26,405
什么是这个维度有多少
and what's the dimension how many this

599
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:33,965
如果我有M，那真的是一个关键的事实
is really such a key fact if I have M

600
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:38,885
方程式ax等于零，如果R为
equations ax equals zero and if R of

601
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,005
那些方程是独立的有多少
those equations are independent how many

602
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,155
解决方案所以空间的维度
solutions so the dimension of the space

603
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,544
我会告诉我有多少解决方案
is going to tell me how many solutions

604
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:53,255
把X分成两个M方程但是真的
to X into two M equations but really

605
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,695
只是真正的独立方程
only are genuine independent equations

606
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:03,485
在这个系统中，ax等于零
in in this system ax equals zero

607
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,455
我可以再次提出多少问题
how many so can I ask the question again

608
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,885
我希望得到答案
and I want the answer in terms of

609
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,564
M和n是我所拥有的我真的拥有我们的
M and n are so I have I really have our

610
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:17,375
方程式，如果我看到ax等于0它
equations if I look at a x equals 0 it

611
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,675
看起来像M个单独的方程式，但是
looks like M separate equations but but

612
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,625
M减去R只是副本或
M minus R of those are just copies or

613
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,954
其他人的组合也是如此
combinations of others so there are

614
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:31,385
独立方程式那么多少
independent equations so what how many

615
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:37,145
我得到了，这就是我要写的东西
of I got and that's what I'm gonna write

616
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:44,074
在这里是的所以是啊所以X有X有n
in here yeah so yeah so X has X has n

617
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,135
组件，你知道真的
components and there are real you know

618
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,474
他们必须要有效的方程式
active equations that they have to

619
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,074
满足
satisfy

620
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,004
并留下n-R这是关键
and that leaves n minus R that's the key

621
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:01,984
指出那是关键点
point that's the key point that there

622
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:05,794
是N且X的部件在未知
are n components of X and unknowns in

623
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:10,584
未知并且存在约束
unknowns and there are are constraints

624
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:14,635
独立约束所以那些n
independent constraints so the those n

625
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,915
如果我想满足那些，你就会得到
you get if I want to satisfy those

626
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,614
敲出尺寸R的约束
constraints that knocks out dimension R

627
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,165
和叶子和减去R所以这是
and leaves and minus R so that's the

628
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:28,165
这里的尺寸和美的
dimension here and the beauty of the

629
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,714
帐户是这两个数字相加的
account is that those two numbers add up

630
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:35,405
对每个人都占了一席之地
to n everybody's accounted for every

631
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,274
矢量在行空间中有一块和
vector has a piece in the row space and

632
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:41,764
零空间中的一块，那就是
a piece in the null space and that's

633
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:45,784
有两件让你回来了
there was two pieces give you back the

634
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:49,534
矢量你看到，这是刚刚好
vector do you see that that's just nice

635
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:51,484
这些数字出来的权利和
that the numbers come out right and of

636
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:54,604
当然他们也在这里出来
course they come out right here too you

637
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:57,304
可以说只是转置一个矩阵和
could say just transpose a matrix and

638
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:59,135
便又同样的事情写出来
write it right the same thing again

639
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,764
列空间的维度是多少
what's the dimension of the column space

640
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:07,444
等于矩阵的列空间
equals the column space of the matrix

641
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:10,324
尺寸R右
has dimension R right

642
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:14,794
和行这这家伙冷落
and the row this this guy is left out of

643
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:17,734
一些线性代数书就像它一样
some linear algebra books as if it like

644
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:19,604
它不属于
it doesn't belong but

645
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:22,504
并且他们清楚你知道没有它
and they clear that you know without it

646
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:28,214
一切都只有3/4ders完成了我们
everything is of only 3/4 ders done we

647
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,794
必须有这个家伙和它的维度
have to have this guy and it's dimension

648
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:38,625
艾玛-是的，是的，是的
is Emma - yeah it's yeah that count is

649
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,524
只是为了转置这个计数是什么
just for a transpose what this count was

650
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:45,854
是的，所以我们有这些尺寸
for a yeah so we've got those dimensions

651
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:55,094
为n减去RR和M-是啊你，你
are n minus R R and M - yeah you you

652
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,704
知道你会知道这一点，但我们需要
know you'll have known this but we need

653
00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:02,204
我们之前在2018年再次看到它
to see it once again in 2018 before we

654
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:05,925
现在就开始使用它了
start using it now is that the

655
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,294
基本定理是，所有的一切-它
fundamental theorem is that all all - it

656
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:14,054
是不是还有另一块
is no there's another piece to the

657
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:16,155
基本定理，这是你的一种
fundamental theorem which is sort of you

658
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,574
可以说这里的几何形状我有一个
could say the the geometry here I have a

659
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:24,405
子空间在这里我有这样一个子空间
subspace here I have a subspace of this

660
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,494
大的n维空间所以我想象
big n-dimensional space so I visualize

661
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:30,524
那些子空间作为某种平面
those subspaces as some kind of a plane

662
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:34,875
R维平面和N减R
an R dimensional plane and an N minus R

663
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,784
维平面，我想看看如何
dimensional plane and I want to see how

664
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,284
这两架飞机是如何相连的
are those two planes connected how are

665
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:47,074
这两个主张相互关联，让我
those two claims connected and let me

666
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:50,234
得到一块空白的
get a piece of the blank piece of the

667
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,665
董事会要记住最后一步吧
board to remember the final step right

668
00:42:52,670 --> 00:43:00,014
所以我们得到了尺寸R和n-R和
so we've got dimensions R and n - R and

669
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:06,554
然后在这里R和M减去R好吧
then over here R and M minus R okay this

670
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,244
是用于null的行
is for the rows this is for the null

671
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:15,494
空间，所以这在它这个行
space so this has the rows in it this

672
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:18,405
将ax等于的解为空
has the null the solutions to ax equals

673
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:25,564
零什么是美丽的几何
zero what is the beautiful geometry that

674
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:29,104
你如何想象这两个空间
how do you visualize those two spaces

675
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,454
你如何形象化让我采取一个
how do you visualize let me take an

676
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:32,415
例
example

677
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:41,385
但一个B124248很抱歉，
but a B 1 2 4 2 4 8 sorry about that

678
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:46,695
你看，这是一个勾结的例子，所以这个
you see it's a hooked up example so this

679
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,844
是2乘3所以有3是什么在
is 2 by 3 so there n is 3 what's in the

680
00:43:52,849 --> 00:44:00,044
这个矩阵的零空间我可以
null space of this matrix can I can you

681
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:03,915
看到一个解决ax等于0的向量
see a vector that solves a x equals 0

682
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,495
事实上会有多少
and in fact how many will there be

683
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,074
什么是我们这个矩阵的东西
what's yeah what's our for this matrix

684
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,255
只是告诉我所有的好东西
just tell me all the good stuff for that

685
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:21,584
例子M是2并且是3并且R是11
example M is 2 and is 3 and R is 1 1

686
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:25,155
每个人都看到一行排名
everybody sees one for the rank the rows

687
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,695
是依赖它只有一个
are dependent it's there's only one

688
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,125
列是独立的行
independent row the columns are

689
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:34,215
依赖只有每一列
dependent there's only like every column

690
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,465
是一个的倍数-它是排名第一
is a multiple of one - it's a rank one

691
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:41,415
矩阵确定怎么样所以它是行
matrix ok what about it so it's row

692
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:48,135
空间的维度为1，它为空
space has dimension 1 and it's null

693
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:55,574
空间的大小为22所以cuzn减去R.
space has dimension 2 2 so cuz n minus R

694
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:58,844
将是2，所以我找了几个
will be 2 so I'm looking for a couple of

695
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:02,354
两个都给0的载体我相信
vectors that both give 0 I believe

696
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:04,145
我认为我只有一个
they're I think I've only got one

697
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,264
独立排在那里，所以我应该
independent row there so I should be

698
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:10,935
能够找到两个不同的向量
able to find two different vectors that

699
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:18,254
是解决斧头等于0有啥
are that solve ax equals 0 so what's a

700
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:26,165
ax的解决方案等于00910减21
solution to ax equals 0 0 91 0 minus 2 1

701
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:29,625
是的，有效，有什么
yeah that works and what's an

702
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:35,774
0的独立解决方案我不扔
independent solution for 0 I don't throw

703
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:38,605
我和0和
me off for 0 and

704
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,295
-是的，看起来很好看
- one yeah that looks good that looks

705
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,805
好
good

706
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,075
然后声称是每一个
and then the claim is that every

707
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,055
解决方案将是这些的组合
solution would be a combination of those

708
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,965
二，这就是有多少
two and that this is how many there are

709
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:55,975
现在这是我正在完成的几何体
and now it's the geometry I'm completing

710
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,165
所以我们有像在此留下2分钟
so we have like two minutes left in this

711
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,805
讲座你只需要告诉我如何
lecture you just have to tell me how

712
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,135
这些之间的关系是什么
what's the relation between the these

713
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,805
在行空间和那个人的家伙
guys in the row space and that guy in

714
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:09,775
零空间是什么关系
the null space what's the relation

715
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,075
在a行和解决方案之间
between the rows of a and the solutions

716
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,435
如果你看到它之间的ax等于零
to ax equals zero between if you see it

717
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,115
如果你在那个向量中看到了那个向量
if you saw that vector in that vector

718
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,455
好吧，现在X是零，那么是什么呢
well a times X is zero now so what does

719
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,055
告诉我们
that tell us

720
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,905
那么我们看到了什么呢？
well what do we see for the for the

721
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:31,555
他们之间的关系是124和0-21
relation between 1 2 4 and 0 - 2 1 they

722
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,215
是正交的，是正交的
are orthogonal terrific yes orthogonal I

723
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,415
通过点积测试0-44加0
test by the dot product 0 - 4 4 add to 0

724
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:45,265
是的，所以那是完全的
yes so so the and that's a completely

725
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,265
当我看到ax等于0时的一般事实
general fact when I look at ax equals 0

726
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,865
它告诉我X是正交的
it's telling me that X is orthogonal to

727
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,235
你看到那些行吗？
the rows did you see that

728
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,805
如果我看的话，你就把它放在这里
you just put it in again here if I look

729
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:03,835
在axa有一堆行X有一个
at ax a has a bunch of rows X has one

730
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,135
列，我得到零，这是重点
column and I get zeros that's the point

731
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,835
零空间和那个等式是
of the null space and that equation is

732
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,815
只是说第1行是正交的
just say that Row 1 is orthogonal

733
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,495
因为这是第1行的点积
because that's the dot product of Row 1

734
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,795
有了X所以这里的第1行第2行超过3和
with X so here's Row 1 Row 2 over 3 and

735
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,575
第4行用X得到X行
Row 4 with X the rows with X and I get

736
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:31,135
零，所以重点是这两个
zeros so the point is then these two

737
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:36,715
空间是90度角，即a
spaces are at 90 degree angles that's a

738
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,745
这四个人真的很整洁
really a neat picture of the four

739
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,895
子空间和这两个是相同的
subspaces and these two are for the same

740
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,645
M中90度角偏离的原因
reason at 90 degree angles off in M

741
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:51,415
三维空间，所以这是这是
dimensional space so this is this is the

742
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,585
基本定理
fundamental theorem

743
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:55,315
线性代数看到的
of linear algebra to see that the

744
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,925
尺寸出来正确和
dimensions come out right and the

745
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:00,925
几何是正确的，然后是
geometry comes out right yeah and then

746
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,255
现在下次跟着笔记和我
now next time following the notes and I

747
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,575
拥有的的几个副本
have a few more copies of the of the

748
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:12,235
一只手伸出手，我们就会动弹
hand that one hand out will we'll move

749
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,565
下周快速到特征值和
on quickly next week to eigenvalues and

750
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,650
positive definite matrices good this is

751
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:26,180
