这是他们主题部分的一部分
that's a part of their subject part of

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,505
深入学习，因为我们到达那里，它是
deep learning as we get there and it's

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,395
可能是前一天的好话题
probably a good topic for the day before

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,605
春假，因为很多人会
spring break because lots of you will

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,845
当然看到你会看到
have seen of course you will have seen

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,415
样本平均值的平均
the sample mean the average of the of

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,775
数据，所以我们有，你会知道
the data so we we have and you'll know

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,005
关于预期的意思让我完成
about the expected mean let me complete

17
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:08,205
什么是预期的意思所以这是
that what's the expected mean so this is

18
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,495
我们所期望的价值X的期望
the expectation of the value X where we

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,224
得到x1的概率P1属于X.
get x 1 with probability P 1 belong to X

20
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:21,435
n概率为Pn所以我们只想要
n with probability P n so we just want

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,785
说出我们的平均输出量是多少
to say what's our average out output

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,294
平均结果，我们加权
average outcome and we weight it by

23
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,325
他们的概率是P1X1加
their probabilities so it's P 1 X 1 plus

24
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,765
沿加PN×N个所以这是
along plus P n X n so that's the

25
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:46,635
x的期望值你舒服
expected value of x do you comfortable

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,275
用那个符号e，因为那就像
with that symbol e because that's like

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,095
到处都有方便的速记
everywhere it gives a handy shorthand

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,605
例如，方差是预期的
for example the variance is the expected

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,114
什么的价值
value of what

30
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,745
方差是基于预期值
the variance is an expected value based

31
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,765
关于广场的这些概率
on these probabilities of the square of

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,344
距离所以每个人都记得它
the distance so everybody remembers it's

33
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,825
涉及广场，这是距离
involves square and it's the distance

34
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,984
从平均而来，所以我让我打电话
from the mean from so I'm let me call

35
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,715
这个状态M也许只是为了拥有一个
this state M maybe just to have a

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,954
较小的字母，但我可以这么做
smaller letter but I could put so it's

37
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,514
距平均值减去M的距离
the distance from the mean minus M it's

38
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,234
预期值的平均值
the expected value the average value of

39
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,954
X减去M平方并且一般来说
X minus M Squared and in general of

40
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,794
当然预期这种协方差
course the expected this covariance

41
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,855
矩阵我可以表达任何
matrix I could express with that any

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,555
符号，但让我把它拉伸为
notation but let me just stretch it as

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,395
至于什么是预期值
far as what would be the expected value

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,995
X的任何功能以及我们有着N
of any function of X well we've got n

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,855
可能的输出x1到xn我们看f
possible outputs x1 to xn we look at f

46
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,125
x1到xn的f
of x1 up to f of xn

47
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,215
我们等待那些可能性
we wait those by the probabilities that

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,755
它们发生了，所以这将让我做
they happen so this would be let me make

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,665
这封电子邮件只是一个小角落
just a little corner for this e letter

50
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,074
所以这将是概率
so this would be the probability that

51
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:27,125
这是f的值的x1倍
that is f of x1 times the value of the

52
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,415
值F在x1所以这是
value F at x1 so this is the

53
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,995
来自x1的可能性和贡献
contribution from the x1 possibility and

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,544
现在我们将它们全部包括在内，所以它将是F
now we include them all so it'll be F

55
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,014
X的输出f以概率PN结束
output f of X ends with probability PN

56
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,305
如果X的X是X减去M平方
and if that f of X is X minus M squared

57
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,104
然后我们得到了我们期望的东西，让我
then we get what we expect and let me

58
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,014
记住，所以我只想保留
remember that so I just want to keep

59
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:03,305
方差去所以这是它的总和
going with variance so it's the sum it's

60
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,544
第一个概率乘以第一个
the first probability times the first

61
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:11,925
输出减去均方
output minus the mean squared

62
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,715
最后的概率次数
the last probability times that last

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,195
输出xn减去M平方
output xn minus M Squared

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,945
每个人都应该知道一秒钟
and everybody should know a second

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,555
表达第二种做法
expression the second way to do that cut

66
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,035
只是如果我写出来的话就是总和
the sum it's just if I just write out

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,575
这些广场，并结合他们一点
those squares and combine them a little

68
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,125
另外，我得到了第二个表达
differently I get a second expression

69
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,295
这通常很有用
which is really useful often a little

70
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,815
更快地计算，所以我可以这样做
faster to compute so can I just do that

71
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,965
这就是X1平方减去2X1
so that's that's X 1 squared minus 2 X 1

72
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,815
M1加M1平方右，然后保存
M 1 plus M 1 squared right and then save

73
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,505
我在这里pnxxn平方减去2xnn
me here pn x xn squared minus 2 xn n

74
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:06,645
再加上M平了很好
plus M Squared good with it

75
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:13,015
抱歉加上哦对不起
sorry plus n oh sorry

76
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:21,474
哦，不，我的意思是我，哦，这只是一个名字
oh no I mean am i oh it's just a name

77
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,625
正确的谢谢你也谢谢你
correct thank you thank you just too

78
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:31,735
我们该死的好确定可以采取的总和，所以我
damn good ok can we take that sum so I

79
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,945
如果我拿这些，得到P1X1平方
get P 1 X 1 squared if I take these the

80
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:45,115
第一个人，所以我已经解释了这一点
first guys so I've accounted for this

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:53,805
现在我将减2P1X1M
and this now I'll take minus 2 P 1 X 1 M

82
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:09,365
所以P1X1M加PnX结束M.
so P 1 X 1 M plus P n X ends M

83
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,895
我只是写出来而且我是
I'm just writing it all out and I'm

84
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,075
要重新组合它，所以现在我有P1M.
gonna recombine it so now I have P 1 M

85
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,365
平方加P2m平方加Pnm
squared plus P 2 m squared plus P n m

86
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,795
平方所以我从P1M得到了什么
squared so what do I have from the P 1 M

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,725
一直到PnMSquared平方
Squared all the way up to P n M Squared

88
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,625
你和我在一起所以MSquared是弗里克
are you with me so M Squared is a Frick

89
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,115
在每个学期，所以我会有一个M.
is in every term so I'm gonna have an M

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,965
平方，它乘以P1是多少
Squared and what's it multiplied by P 1

91
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,315
这里P2这里Pn我在这里添加它们
here P 2 here P n here I add those up

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,645
我得到1就是这样
and I get 1 so that's it

93
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,545
好的，现在我只是简化这件事
ok and now I'll just simplify this thing

94
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,785
所以这是真正的预期值
so this is really the expected value of

95
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,095
我在这里看到了什么
what what am i seeing in this in this

96
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,235
将x约为期望值
term the about the expected value of x

97
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,255
平方
squared right

98
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,625
与X的预期值不同
different from the expected value of X

99
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,075
减去M平方当然这只是
minus M Squared of course this is just

100
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,655
从这里开始的第一个任期，但现在做什么
the first term from here but now what do

101
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,905
我得到这个第二项井
I get for this second term well the

102
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,785
重点是M出来所以这是
point is that M comes out so this is

103
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,555
减去和M和a2以及它做什么
minus and M and a 2 and what it what do

104
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,915
我离开了，所以我已经用完了M我
I have left so I've used up the M I've

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,535
用完2P1X1加P和Xn
used up the 2 P 1 X 1 plus P and X n

106
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,485
什么是每个人都应该付出的代价
what's that everybody should just pay

107
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,975
注意这个微不足道我的意思是我们
attention to this trivial I mean we're

108
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,675
只是在这里做高中代数但是
just doing high school algebra here but

109
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,175
但P1X1到P和Xn是M所以我
but P 1 X 1 up to P and X n is M so I

110
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,165
还有另一个MMSquared那里，我
have another M M Squared there and I've

111
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,105
一加上M个平方
a plus M Squared

112
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,545
从最后，所以你看到它
from the end so you see that it is

113
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,915
另一个表达式的期望值
another expression the expected value of

114
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,635
x平方减去M平方代数
x squared minus M Squared just algebra

115
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,025
那就是这个，所以如果
that that is the same as this so that if

116
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,765
你碰巧有一个方便的方法
you happen to have a handy way to

117
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,615
计算
compute

118
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,955
x的预期值平方你
the expected value of x squared you

119
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,845
只会减去M平方而你
would just subtract M squared and you'd

120
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,865
和它一样是的，只是
have the same as this yeah it's just

121
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,085
代数没关系
algebra okay

122
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,724
我可以让我们更深入一点
can i let's let's go a little deeper

123
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,175
如果我能找到它，可以在这里找点东西
with something here if I can find it

124
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,774
有两个很大的不平等
there are two great inequalities in

125
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,965
统计数据和第一个是由于
statistics and the first one is due to

126
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,845
马尔科夫和我不知道你是否知道
Markov and I don't know if you know

127
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:57,795
马尔科夫不平等它很容易出来
Markov inequality it it comes out easily

128
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,605
事实上我太喜欢我喜欢我了
in fact too easily I like I'm kind of

129
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,225
现在对此讨论感到高兴
happy with the discussion in this is now

130
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,675
我跳到了第五部分
I'm jumped to section five over the book

131
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,105
所以我需要发布第5节
so I'll need to post section 5 which is

132
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,405
概率和统计数据，你会
probability and statistics and you'll

133
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,035
看到这个Markov不等式所以它就是这样
see this Markov inequality so it just

134
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,175
涉及这些东西，这就是为什么我会
involves this stuff so that's why I'll

135
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,305
现在去做吧
go do it now

136
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:37,345
马尔科夫不平等他是一个伟大的俄罗斯人
Markov inequality he was a great Russian

137
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,225
数学家或大概在1900年和
mathematician or probably about 1900 and

138
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,865
我们将看到马尔可夫链和马尔科夫
we will see Markov chains and Markov

139
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,385
流程是美丽的线性
processes that's beautiful linear

140
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,235
代数但是这个小的不等式是
algebra but this little inequality is

141
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,175
不是它正在玩的矩阵
not matrices it's just playing with

142
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:02,685
这些但它适用于两个
these but and it applies to two

143
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,795
非负面事件，所以我会赢
non-negative events so I'm gonna win

144
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,145
我应该说所有的X都适用
shall I say applies when all the X all

145
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,155
输出大于等于零
the outputs are greater equal zero so

146
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,825
这将是我要去的
it's going to be a it's gonna I'm gonna

147
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,845
使用这个事实所以它不适用于
use that fact so it doesn't apply to to

148
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,395
类似于高斯的东西，因为它们是
something like Gaussian because they're

149
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,735
高斯输出一路从
Gaussian the outputs go all the way from

150
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,965
减去无穷大和
minus infinity to and

151
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,264
它确实适用于很多
finiti it does apply to a lot of

152
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,405
重要的，简单的，所以我
important ones and simple one so I'm

153
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,954
只是说让我们假设我愿意
just saying let's suppose I would give

154
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,735
这种有限概率的证明
the proof for this finite probability

155
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,204
并且有类似的证据相似
and there'd be a similar proof similar

156
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,884
这里到处讨论
discussion everywhere here

157
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,675
对于连续概率那么做什么呢
for continuous probability so what does

158
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,944
马尔科夫说让我确定我做对了
Markov say let me be sure I get it right

159
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,745
因为我不是一个职业在这个它是
because I'm not a pro at this it it's

160
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,365
自然要估算
natural to want to estimate the

161
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:16,975
X大于等于的概率
probability that X is greater equals

162
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,725
一些数字a了解什么是
some number a get some idea what's the

163
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,055
X大于等于a的概率
probability of X being greater equal a

164
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,144
所以我们知道什么是肯定的
so what do we know there's a certainly a

165
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,884
数字为0到1之间的数字
number between 0 & 1 that number is

166
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,504
随着增加而变小
going to get smaller as a increases

167
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,134
因为我们将要询问
because we're going to be asking for

168
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:42,925
更多，如果我采取说两次
more if if if I take a to be say twice

169
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,545
平均值好，是的，我想我接受了
the mean well yeah suppose I take a to

170
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,934
什么是我能做到的两倍
be twice the mean what what so can I

171
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,454
估计概率可能是多少
estimate what that probability could be

172
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,415
这就是马尔科夫所做的事情
and that's what Markov has done he says

173
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:05,095
但这种可能性是至少在
the probability of that is at least at

174
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,235
最抱歉
most sorry

175
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,215
看我以前至少有一个橡皮擦
see I used to have an eraser at least

176
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:20,304
对不起，是的，是的，或者更少
sorry at most yes got it is less or

177
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:26,965
等于平均x-bar是另一种方式
equal to the mean x-bar is another way

178
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,524
写下平均值除以a和this
to write the mean divided by a and this

179
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:37,194
这是一个或多个的平均值
is this is the mean over a or it's the

180
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:41,634
在x的预期值，我们可以看到
expected value of x over a we could see

181
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,015
其中任何一个
any of those

182
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:52,195
符号还可以，正如我们所期望的那样
notations okay and as we expect as a

183
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,695
增加了这个概率
increases the probability this this

184
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,555
数字下降概率发生了
number goes down the probability goes

185
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,905
超过一个，这是一个漂亮的
down of exceeding a so that's a pretty

186
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,105
得到这个概率的简单估计
simple estimate to get this probability

187
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,105
仅就数字a而言
just in terms of the number a which has

188
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,995
进来是因为它是其中的一部分
to come in because it's part of the

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,375
问题和我X好吧所以让我
question and the me X okay so let me

190
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,765
举一个例子为等于三好吗
take an example as a equals three okay

191
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,905
所以我要去尝试我会只为
so I'm going to try I'm gonna just for

192
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,875
例子假设a是我想要的三个
example suppose a was three I want to

193
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,135
表明XX的概率
show that the probability of X X being

194
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,815
大于或等于三是没关系
greater than or equal to three yeah okay

195
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,955
所以让我们，我们不知道，我们没有
so let's we we don't know we don't have

196
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,505
如果我们写的话，许多事实都可以使用
many facts to work with so if we write

197
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,155
那些下来我们应该看到原因没关系
those down we should see the reason okay

198
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,595
所以我知道平均值是X的一个
so I know that the mean is a of X so

199
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,745
让我们看看我是否会接受我是的
let's see I'm am I gonna take yeah I'm

200
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,235
例如，让我们采取平均值
gonna for example let's take the mean to

201
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,085
是一个好的所以我会想象
be one okay so I'm gonna imagine that

202
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,795
平均值是一个，我要求的
the mean is one and that I'm asking for

203
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,005
X会变大的机会是什么？
what's the chance that X will be bigger

204
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,055
超过三，我会估计
than three and I'll get an estimate of

205
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,975
三分之一，所以我试图展示
one-third so I'm trying to show to show

206
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:35,275
X的概率大于等于3
the probability of X greater equal three

207
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,795
小于或等于我说的意思
is less or equal to the mean I'm saying

208
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,855
是一个是三个，所以有更少或
is one a is three so there's less or

209
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,325
等于1/3现在为什么这是真的那样
equal 1/3 now why is that true that's

210
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,715
我有什么表现好我认为是
what I have to show okay I think is that

211
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,005
如果我写下我所知道的，我会看到它
if I write down what I know I'll see it

212
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,894
好的
okay

213
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,795
好吧，让我让我加油吧
all right so let me let me just raise

214
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,225
有这么一点点，我有一个房间
that a little so that I have a room to

215
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,175
写这么知道我知道的
write so what do I know I know the

216
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,715
肉的定义所以我知道X.
definition of the meat so I know that X

217
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:23,865
1次P1加X2P2加X3P3
1 times P 1 plus X 2 P 2 plus X 3 P 3

218
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,514
让我在这里被带走X5p
allow me to get carried away here X 5 p

219
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,925
5说是我所写的是什么
5 say is is what so what I've written

220
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,834
这是我的假设
down there is the mean and I'm assuming

221
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,415
这是1，所以这是我的事实
that to be 1 so this is the fact that I

222
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:48,535
知道是1，我想要的是什么
know is 1 and what is it that I want to

223
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,014
证明我想知道的概率
prove I want to know the probability of

224
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,644
更大等于3所以是什么
being greater equals 3 so what's the

225
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,274
概率结果将是
probability that the result will be

226
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:06,445
大于等于3它是P3所以这是
greater equal 3 it's P 3 so this this is

227
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,274
说P3加P对于那些是
saying that P 3 plus P for those this is

228
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,074
这些是这些概率
these are the probabilities these are

229
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,385
不同的方式，我可能是
the different ways that I might be

230
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,204
更大等于3，我声称
greater equals 3 and I'm claiming that

231
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:26,785
这个数字少于或等于我喜欢的1/3
that's less or equal 1/3 what I liked

232
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,355
关于这种基本方法是这样的
about this elementary approach is that

233
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,055
我已经说明了这些事实
I've stated these facts these

234
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,824
概率假设和和
probability assumptions and and and

235
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,255
结论直接以数字表示
conclusions directly in terms of numbers

236
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,495
所以我只想表明如果是这样的话
so I just want to show that if this is

237
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,295
那是真的
true then that's true

238
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,245
哦，让我们来看看，我想我在想，
oh let's see I guess I'm thinking that

239
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,785
对不起，我甚至更加特别
the I'm sorry I even took a more special

240
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:04,475
我正在考虑x1为1X的情况
case I'm taking the case where x1 is 1 X

241
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:14,345
2是2×3是3×4是4，X5是5
2 is 2 X 3 is 3 X 4 is 4 and X 5 is 5 so

242
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,525
满足我的条件满足
that satisfies satisfies my condition

243
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:24,575
输出1234或5是
that the the outputs 1 2 3 4 or 5 are

244
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,665
所有马尔可夫马尔科夫只适用于
all Markov Markov only applies when

245
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,835
他们都等于0所以我不得不这样做
they're all greater equals 0 so I had to

246
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,265
拿一个我只是想象这个
take a so I'm just imagining this

247
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,085
特殊情况下可能的输出
special case where the possible outputs

248
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,925
是12345他们的概率是P.
are 1 2 3 4 5 their probabilities are P

249
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:50,465
1P2P3P4P5平均值为1和什么
1 P 2 P 3 P 4 P 5 the mean is 1 and what

250
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,175
我要表明的是概率
I want to show is that the probability

251
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,335
的大于3小于或等于
of being greater than 3 is less or equal

252
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,065
1/3，你能把这两个放在一起吗？
1/3 and can you put together these two

253
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,055
你能断定这给予我们要
can you conclude given this we want to

254
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,965
得出这样的结论让我退后一步
conclude that let me just step back a

255
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,765
分钟
minute

256
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:17,315
所以我们知道的就是我们所知道的
so we're what do we know here we know

257
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,775
这是第一行，我们想要证明
this the first line and we want to prove

258
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,715
第二行我们还知道一件事
the second line we know one more thing

259
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,545
所有的概率我们都知道
all the probabilities well we know the

260
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,375
概率加1，我们知道
probabilities add to 1 and we know

261
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,925
他们都等于0，所以让我吧
they're all greater equals 0 so let me

262
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,655
把这些事实在这里也
put those facts in here too

263
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:42,005
我们知道P1加P2加P3加
we know that P 1 plus P 2 plus P 3 plus

264
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,075
B4加B5是我们知道的1和我们
B 4 plus B 5 is 1 that we know and we

265
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,915
也知道所有的豌豆都更大
also know that all the peas are greater

266
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:02,565
等于或等于0好吧好吧
than or equal to 0 okay okay

267
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,515
所以我们走了，我想我的想法就是这个
so here we go I think my my idea is this

268
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,295
难道，这就是看三次p3
is this is looking at three times P 3

269
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,165
再加上B4+P5所以我要拿3P
plus B 4 + P 5 so I'm going to take 3 P

270
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:22,735
3加3P4远离此，所以这将
3 plus 3 P 4 away from this so this will

271
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:35,125
说P1加2P2加3块礁
say P 1 plus 2 P 2 plus 3 of piece reef

272
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,945
加上第4页以及第5页我只是捡了3
plus P 4 plus P 5 I'm just picking out 3

273
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,965
那些家伙
of those guys

274
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,595
加上我还有一个P4来解释
plus I have one more P 4 to account for

275
00:19:45,600 --> 00:20:02,475
还有两个P5现在给了一个好的
and two more P 5 gives one okay good now

276
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,405
这就是我想要证明的
this is what I'm trying to prove so that

277
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,205
我在这里试图证明这一点
is here I'm trying to prove that this

278
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,165
事情是我想要证明的东西
thing is what am I trying to prove about

279
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,525
这个数字，你很抱歉我在说话
that number and you're sorry I'm talking

280
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,685
很多，但现在我真的来了
a lot but now I've really come to the

281
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,505
指出马尔科夫告诉我的是什么
point what what is Markov telling me

282
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,775
关于那个更少或更少的数字
about that number that's that is less or

283
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,865
等于感谢好吧我正在努力证明
equal to thanks okay I'm trying to prove

284
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,035
这是一个小于或等于一个
that this is less or equal one that's

285
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,555
什么马尔科夫告诉我，但假设它是
what Markov tells me but suppose it was

286
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,575
不止一个
greater than one

287
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,125
你看到问题了吗？
do you see the problem you see why it

288
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:48,835
不能大于一，因为为什么
can't be greater than one because why

289
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,445
所有其他术语都是更大的等于
all the other terms are greater equals

290
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:52,975
零
zero

291
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,054
概率大于或等于零
probabilities are greater or equal zero

292
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,995
这些都是更大的等于零和
these are all greater equal zero and the

293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,755
为了这个，总的东西增加了一个
total thing adds to one so that this

294
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,445
片必须是较小等于所述一个
piece has to be lesser equal the one

295
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,414
这是正确的，是的，所以很多
that's right that's it yeah so a lot of

296
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,125
谈论那里简单的想法，你会看到
talking there simple idea and you'll see

297
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,404
正是这个例子写下来的
the exactly this example written down in

298
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:21,065
注意没关系然后你会看到更多
notes okay and then you'll see a more

299
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,705
马尔可夫不等式的传统证明
conventional proof of Markov inequality

300
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,465
采取任何简单的不平等步骤
by taking any simple inequality steps

301
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,105
但是在某种程度上更加神秘
but there's somehow more mysterious for

302
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,085
我这是明确的
me this was explicit

303
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,065
好的，所以马库夫chebychev是
okay so that's Markov chebychev is the

304
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,635
其他伟大的俄罗斯可能的名单
other great russian probable list of the

305
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:57,575
时间和他得到了他的不平等
time and he gets his his inequality so

306
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,705
有两个是马尔科夫
there are the two there's markov

307
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,544
不平等让我再次写下来
inequality let me write it down again

308
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:08,365
它在这里是马尔科夫不平等
what it was here was markov inequality

309
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,174
关于挫败假设chebychev
on the barkoff assumption chebychev

310
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:14,674
没有做出这样的假设
doesn't make that assumption

311
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:25,774
所以现在不能假设输出
so now no no assumption that the outputs

312
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,485
是等于它不现在没事来
are equals it doesn't come in okay now

313
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,394
什么是chebychev试图估计
what is chebychev trying to estimate

314
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:34,475
好的
okay

315
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,085
让我们转向chebychev，那就是
let's move to chebychev and that's the

316
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:44,385
最后一个人
last guy

317
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,595
所以他对蒂米·查韦斯感兴趣
so he Timmy Chavez into it interested in

318
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:55,975
X减去的概率概率
the probability probability that X minus

319
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,914
对我来说，我可以使用它的平均值
the mean M can I use that for me is

320
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:11,215
可能大于或等于该
probably greater or equal to a the

321
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,044
是一种距离的概率
probability of being sort of a distance

322
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,975
一个从外地开会，以便再次为他们
a away from the meet so again as they

323
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,515
增加我问的更多我问它
increases I'm asking more I'm asking it

324
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,185
远离平均和
to be further away from the mean and the

325
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,065
概率会下降，然后是
probability will drop and then the

326
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,725
问题是我们可以这样估计这个
question is can we estimate this so this

327
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,775
是一个不同的估计，但它是相似的
is a different estimate but it's similar

328
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,775
类似的问题和什么是胖乎乎的
similar question and what's chubby

329
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,205
杰夫的回答这个所以这是
Jeff's answer for this so this is the

330
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,664
这个概率我必须忍受大
probability of this I have to put up big

331
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:50,245
这一切都是一口气的
that's all one grit one mouthful the

332
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:56,155
这个X减去M的概率
probability of being that this X minus M

333
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,355
大于等于好，并再次
is greater equal to a okay and again

334
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,325
我们将会有更少或相等
we're gonna have is less or equal to

335
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:13,664
Sigma平方现在超过了一个正方形
Sigma squared now comes in over a square

336
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:19,285
所以这是雪佛兰的cheff，我只是采取
so that's Chevy cheff and I just take

337
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,025
今天是时候做这两个因为了
time today to do these two because

338
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,765
他们是它们涉及的分析有
they're they involve analysis there

339
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,645
有基本的工具排序的
there are basic tools as sort of the

340
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,145
如果你是第一件事，你会想到
first thing you think of if you're

341
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,935
试图估计一个概率
trying to estimate a probability does it

342
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,435
适合马尔科夫，只有马尔科夫
fit Markov and it only Markov only

343
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,265
适用所以我将只适用于当放
applies so I'll put only applies when

344
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,125
X都大于或等于零
the X's are all greater or equal zero

345
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:51,174
这适合chebychev现在我们是
here does it fit chebychev and now we're

346
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,395
采取绝对值，所以我们不是
taking absolute values so we're not

347
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,885
关注X的大小
concerned about the size of X

348
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,435
我们正在与他们保持距离
and we're taking the distance from em so

349
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,315
我们显然是在世界的
we're obviously in the world of

350
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,465
差异我们离他们的距离还可以
variances we're distances from em okay

351
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,905
和chebychev的证据来了
and and the proof of chebychev is comes

352
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,025
直接来自马尔科夫所以我们为什么
directly from Markov so so why we're

353
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:17,215
要适用马尔科夫这么好的事情
going to apply Markov so good thing that

354
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:25,674
马尔科夫先来了-现在让我说
Markov came first - now let me just say

355
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:37,645
这个权利-a-a-一个新的让我打电话
this right - a - a - a new let me call

356
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:45,595
它这将是一个新的输出和它
it Y this will be a new output and it

357
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:57,475
将是X减去M平方所以如果我
will be X minus M Squared so that's if I

358
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,235
当然具有相同的可能性
of course with the same probability so

359
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,465
为什么我是x均匀的平方和
why I is x i- m the mean squared and the

360
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:14,804
相同的概率相同的概率P.
same probabilities same probabilities P

361
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:21,375
好吧所以我想如果我要申请
okay so I guess if I'm going to apply

362
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,955
我只想接受它需要一个
I'm just going to take that it takes a

363
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:32,125
明智的，而不是这里的X.
wise here instead of the X's here so and

364
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,595
然后应用马尔科夫，那么什么是X吧，如果
then apply Markov so what is X bar so if

365
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,485
我想申请Markov我必须要想
I want to apply Markov I have to figure

366
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,575
在这里我必须得到X的平均值
out the mean of X over here I have to

367
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,515
弄清楚Y的意思是
figure out the mean of Y what is the

368
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,085
的Y指的是平均值的总和
mean of Y the mean value the sum of

369
00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:02,065
概率x明智
probabilities x wise

370
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,545
你应该认识到这是
you're supposed to recognize it this is

371
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:12,815
概率和我的y的总和
the sum of probabilities and my y's are

372
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:20,525
xi减去均方，所以这个
the x i minus the mean squared so this

373
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:25,325
这就是这件事的意思
is the mean for this this this y thing

374
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,505
我带来的是那个公式
that I've brought in has that formula

375
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,845
我们认识到这个数量是多少
and we recognize what that quantity is

376
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,495
这就是西格玛平方西格玛的平方
that is that Sigma squared Sigma squared

377
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,285
对于原始X来说就是这样
for the original X's so that's just

378
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:43,475
这是非常大，所以平均是西格玛是
that's great so the mean is Sigma is the

379
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,015
老西格玛广场那些感叹
old Sigma square those are exclamation

380
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,665
标记好，所以我现在看到了
marks okay so then I do you see that now

381
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,025
马尔科夫看起来像或chebychev是
Markov is looking like or chebychev is

382
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,795
看起来像马尔科夫，因为在这里
looking like Markov because here over

383
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,185
这里将是我现在想要的X.
here will be the X now I want the

384
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:11,525
y的期望值超过让我们看看是的
expected value of y over let's see yep

385
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:15,185
所以预期的Y就是这样
so the expected Y is going to be that

386
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,005
现在我有什么要分开的呢
and now what do I have to divide by I

387
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,005
想知道某事的可能性
want to know probabilities of something

388
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,825
这个东西越大越大
being bigger of this thing being bigger

389
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,895
不是现在，但我看在Y的这样
than a but now I'm looking at the Y's so

390
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,575
如果X减去M的概率是
the probability of if X minus M is

391
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,265
大于或等于然后X减去
greater than or equal to a then X minus

392
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,655
XI减去MSquared大于等于a
X I minus M Squared is greater equal a

393
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:48,755
平方如此，所以我在这里为我做了一个
squared so so I my my a over here for X

394
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,165
我现在正在解决这个问题
is now turning in this problem where I'm

395
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,415
看起来概率大于等于a
looking a probability greater equal a

396
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,185
但是，这就是a
but squaring it this the is the a

397
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,894
平方
squared

398
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:07,365
所以马克夫在这里适用于Y.
so that's Markov applied to Y here's

399
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,914
马尔科夫应用于X和X必须是
Markov applied to X and X had to be

400
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,445
更大等于零
greater equals zero

401
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,685
所以在这里chebychev拿了一个Y.
so over here chebychev took a Y which

402
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,235
那么大于等于零
was greater equals zero then just

403
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,855
应用马尔可夫并认识到了什么
applied Markov and recognized that what

404
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,935
平均值是他的变量Xmy
that the mean was of his variable X my

405
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,445
我的X减去MSquared就是西格玛
my X minus M Squared was exactly Sigma

406
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:38,024
平方而且它再次掉出来了
squared and it fell out so again here is

407
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:44,404
马尔科夫的一个非常简单的证明然后
a very simple proof for Markov and then

408
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,445
每个人都同意chebychev跟随
everybody agrees that chebychev follows

409
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,024
马克诺夫马克，所以那些
right away from Markov ok so those are

410
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:54,794
现在另一个是两个基本的不平等
two basic inequalities now the other

411
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,595
话题，我想处理是
topic that I wanted to to deal with was

412
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,745
你必须的协方差协方差矩阵
covariance covariance matrix you have to

413
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,585
变得舒服或者那是什么
get like comfortable or what is that

414
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,895
什么是协方差好的
what's the covariance okay

415
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:15,865
[掌声]
[Applause]

416
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:25,685
所以协方差协方差矩阵和它
so covariance covariance matrix and it

417
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:32,255
当我有MM的时候，M将是M.
will be M by M when I have M M sort of

418
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:41,885
实验M立刻让我带走了我
experiments M at once let me take a me

419
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,215
把两个你放在一起你会看到一切
put the two you you'll see everything

420
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,715
对于m等于2，所以这是我们的
for m equal to two so it's a we're

421
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,005
预计由两个矩阵得到两个
expecting to get a two by two matrix and

422
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,585
我们从什么开始，我们开始我们
what are we starting with we start we're

423
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,465
我们一次做两个实验
doing two experiments at once so we have

424
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:09,355
两个输出两个输出X和y
two outputs two outputs an X and the y

425
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,185
所以X是X的输出
so the X's are the outputs from the X

426
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,025
实验Y是输出
experiment the Y's are the output from

427
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,025
来自第二次实验我们是
the from a second experiment we're

428
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,685
翻转两个硬币让我们接受
flipping two coins so let's take that

429
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:30,755
例如两个硬币硬币一个零或
example two coins coin one gets zero or

430
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:40,465
一个人的概率1/2硬币到
one with people probability 1/2 coin to

431
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:47,075
0或1，概率为1/2，所以他们是
0 or 1 with probability 1/2 so they're

432
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:53,185
公平的硬币，但我没有说的是
fair coins but what I haven't said is

433
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,425
两者之间是否存在联系？
are there is there a connection between

434
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:01,085
输出这是X这是Y.
the output this is the X this is the Y

435
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,705
如果我将硬币粘在一起，那么
is if I glue the coins together then the

436
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,775
我认为这两个输出是一样的
two outputs are the same I think this

437
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,695
对我来说，这是一个模型问题
for me this is a model question that

438
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,115
揭示了协方差的主要观点
brings out the main point of covariance

439
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,465
如果我分开翻转两个硬币
if I flip two coins separately quite

440
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,765
独立然后没有
independently then there's no

441
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,924
[音乐]
[Music]

442
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:29,764
我不能不知道为什么来自
I can't I don't know more about why from

443
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,225
知道X，如果我知道一个人的答案
knowing X if I know the answer to one

444
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,414
翻转它并没有告诉我任何事情
flip it doesn't tell me anything about

445
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,914
第二个如果他们是独立的
the second if they're independent

446
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,284
不相关，但如果两个硬币是
uncorrelated but if the two coins are

447
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:46,924
粘在一起，然后头，所以上来
glued together then heads so come up for

448
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:47,705
两个硬币
both coins

449
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,505
我将只有两个
it'll be I'll only have two

450
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,725
可能是头脑或头脑的可能性
possibilities that'll be heads heads or

451
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,065
尾巴让我让我写下来
tails tails let me let me write down

452
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,654
有两种不同的情景
that there was two different scenarios

453
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:04,235
如此脱胶，我从没想过要写
so unglued I never expected to write

454
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,835
数学课上的那个词，我是什么
that word in a math class and what am I

455
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,804
写下来我要写
going to write down I'm going to write

456
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:22,804
向下一个带有硬币头尾的矩阵
down a matrix with heads tails for coin

457
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:28,625
1和硬币2的头和尾，所以
1 and heads and tails for coin 2 so the

458
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,955
可能性是硬币得到的头
possibilities are coin one gets heads

459
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,634
而第二点得到的是什么
and point two gets heads what's the

460
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,485
这是脱胶的概率
probability of that this is the unglued

461
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,065
案件所以我要创造一点
case so I'm gonna create a little

462
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:42,725
关节概率矩阵
probability matrix of joint

463
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,784
概率这是真正的关键词
probabilities that's really the key word

464
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:49,024
你是的，我在这里讨论
that you yeah that I'm discussing here

465
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:54,965
联合概率让我们完成
joint probabilities so let's complete

466
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,134
那个矩阵所以我有脱胶硬币
that matrix so I have unglued coins

467
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:02,044
独立的硬币我把它们翻了个什么
independent coins I flip them both what

468
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,445
获得成功的机会是什么？
what is the chances of getting heads on

469
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:10,324
两者都有1/4的机会是什么
both 1/4 what are the chances of what do

470
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:11,285
我放在这里
I put in here

471
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,404
这意味着在第一枚硬币和头上
this means heads on the first coin and

472
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,384
第二女王和王后的尾巴
tails on the second Queen and the

473
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:22,445
那概率为1/4和1/4位置
probability of that is 1/4 and 1/4 here

474
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,715
和1/4在这里所以我有四个
and 1/4 here so I've there four

475
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,045
这是我投入一个2x2的可能性
possibilities which I put into a 2x2

476
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,255
矩阵而不是长矢量我的两个
matrix instead of a long vector my two

477
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,745
头部有四种可能性
four possibilities are heads heads has

478
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,745
尾巴尾巴尾巴尾巴
heads tails tails heads and tails tails

479
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,215
他们有平等的
and they have equal

480
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:44,904
概率为1/4，但现在如果他们被胶合了
probability 1/4 but now if they're glued

481
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,424
第一个硬币头上的头部和尾部
heads and tails on the first coin heads

482
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:53,075
在第一个上的第二个尾巴
and tails on the second on the first

483
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,285
硬币头和尾巴在第二枚硬币上
coin heads and tails on the second coin

484
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:01,625
好吧，现在我放在那里，所以
okay now what do I put in there so the

485
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,695
两个硬币粘在一起是什么
two coins are glued together what is the

486
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:10,295
他们俩都有可能成为什么样的人
chance that they both come up heads what

487
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,625
如果一个人出现，那就是对了一半
half right one half if one comes up

488
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,045
头
heads

489
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,745
另一种是粘在它它会
the other one is glued to it it will

490
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,735
还有什么是概率
also what what's the probability of

491
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,985
头上的尾巴头上有一条尾巴
heads tails heads on one tails on the

492
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,775
其他当然是零谢谢
other is of course zero thanks

493
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,245
这里是0，这里是1/2，所以我的意思
and here's 0 and here 1/2 so what I've

494
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,205
创造了2个可能加2
created are those 2 possible plus 2

495
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,755
不同的设置两种不同的场景
different setups two different scenarios

496
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,725
脱胶和粘合，在这一个我们
unglued and glued and in this one we

497
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,315
有，但每个每个实验装置
have but each each experimental setup

498
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,075
有它的联合概率矩阵
has its matrix of joint probabilities

499
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,025
这是事情是这样的，有
that's that's the thing that there are

500
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,745
这里有四个数字我们有四个数字
four numbers here four numbers we have

501
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,035
所有的可能性，我们有任何任何
all possibilities we have any any

502
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,975
可能的X和同时任何
possible X and at the same time any

503
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,565
可能Y所以假设我们假设了我们
possible Y so suppose we had suppose we

504
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:14,765
正在运行三个实验，我们
were running three experiments and we

505
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:21,005
很好，那会是什么
had well so what would be the what would

506
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,885
如果我跑三个就是这种情况
be the situation if I was running three

507
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,094
用独立的三个实验
experiments with an independent three

508
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,545
独立的公平硬币，所以我有
independent fair coins so I'd have I'd

509
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,755
在这张脱胶的照片中，但我愿意
be in this unglued picture but I would

510
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,594
有三个不同的实验
have three different experiments that

511
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,975
我正在运行什么会是什么
I'm running then what what's what would

512
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,705
我会怎样看待他们
be what would I be looking at them just

513
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,844
整个想法是看看这是什么
the whole idea is to see what is this

514
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:52,535
像联合概率一样假设我有
like joint probability so suppose I have

515
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,135
三
three

516
00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:03,034
硬币unglue然后我想知道喜欢
coin unglue then I want to know like

517
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,425
有可能获得头脑
some probability of getting heads on the

518
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,584
第一个头在第二个头上
first heads on the second heads on the

519
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:11,735
第三个就是给我这个
third will be what just to give me that

520
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,794
数字是什么概率
number what will be the probability of

521
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,745
这三个人都是独立的
that all three of them independently

522
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,274
八点好，但现在我的
come up heads one eight okay but now my

523
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:27,485
问题是，这样我有什么话，我
question is so what do I have then I

524
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,784
有尾巴的概率
have probability of heads of say tails

525
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:35,314
我们在这里有三个指数
heads heads I've got three indices here

526
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,375
最终降到尾巴的概率
eventually down to probability of tails

527
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,014
每个人在最后看到的尾巴尾巴
tails tails everybody sees at the end of

528
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:43,655
这些数字将是1/8但是
the numbers are going to be 1/8 but

529
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,895
什么是适合他们的地方
what's the what's where those fit in

530
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,544
它们不适合矩阵，因为我已经
they don't fit in a matrix because I've

531
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:57,245
这里有三个指数，所以我想是什么
got three indices here so I guess what

532
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,165
我们今天看到我有点意识到了
we're seeing I sort of realized today

533
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,104
我们第一次看到一个张量
we're seeing for the first time a tensor

534
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:09,754
张量是一种三向结构
a tensor is a three-way structure

535
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:13,175
三元矩阵你可以这么说我们
three-way matrix you could say so we

536
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,274
我想我想到了这一点
have I guess I think of the of this

537
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:23,705
而不是像那样的广场
instead of a square like that an

538
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,334
普通矩阵我不得不想到立方体
ordinary matrix I have to think of cube

539
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:31,475
我有一个带有两个的立方体
right I have a cube with with with two

540
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,965
行两列和Evers
rows two columns and to what Evers

541
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,695
层有人可能会说，为层
layers somebody might say layers for

542
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,715
那你看到的基质
that do you see that the the matrix has

543
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,385
成为
become

544
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:58,864
一个三通的东西和一个紧张的
a three-way thing a tenser and the

545
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,044
那个缩小的条目，所以它是两个
entries in that tenser so it's two by

546
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:08,764
两个两个而不是M由n代表a
two by two that instead of M by n for a

547
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:10,984
矩阵我必须给你数量
matrix I have to give you the number of

548
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:13,054
行和列数和
rows and number of columns and the

549
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,304
层数进入电路板以便
number of layers going into the board so

550
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:20,915
以你知道的方式行
rows going one way you know

551
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,905
列行然后是层
columns rows and then layers are going

552
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,635
深，所以我将它会有十
deep so I will that it will have a ten

553
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:34,445
树，当然在这个简单的情况下
trees and of course in this simple case

554
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:40,804
每将一个八这在
each will be one eight in this in that

555
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:44,165
在那个unglue完全独立的方式
in that unglue totally independent way

556
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,945
但是你可以想象一下
but but then you can imagine some

557
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,494
依赖说得好，如果我这样做
dependence say well if I so what would

558
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:56,094
如果我把第一和第三枚硬币粘在一起，就会发生
happen if I glued coins one and three I

559
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,284
仍然会有一个张量仍然有一个
would still have a tensor still have a

560
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:02,725
所有的二乘两乘张量
two by two by two tensor of all the

561
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,205
现在的可能性，但其中一些是
possibilities now but some of those are

562
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,514
将有概率为零联合
going to have probability zero the joint

563
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,304
如果我把硬币粘在一起的可能性
probability if I've glued coin one to

564
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,415
然后硬币三的概率
coin three then the probability of

565
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,044
在一个共同的头看到的一切
jointly seeing heads on one whatever on

566
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:24,875
三个上面的两个尾巴将为零
two tails on three will be zero right

567
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,145
因为如果我坚持下去就不会发生这种情况
because that can't happen if I've glued

568
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,304
硬币一和三，所以我会有八个
coins one and three so I'll have eight

569
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:35,165
条目在这里的，这是
entries in here in the this is the

570
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:40,324
脱胶情况，然后我可以有
unglued case and then I could have the

571
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:46,205
两个硬币是胶水的情况和我一样
case where two coins are glue and as I

572
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:51,034
说我认为我会有四个
say I think the the I would have four

573
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:57,675
我可能有四分之一的四分之一
I'd have one quarter four times probably

574
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,824
然后，如果我有任何备用胶水，我会胶水
and then if I had any spare glue I glue

575
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:09,975
所有三个硬币我翻转卡住了
all three coins I flip that stuck

576
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,024
在一起，我永远不会得到头脑
together thing and I never get heads

577
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:17,354
尾巴只有我的可能性
tails heads right only possibilities I

578
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,024
让我们的脑袋头顶和尾巴
get our heads heads heads and tails

579
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:21,765
尾巴因为它们被胶合而尾巴
tails tails because they're glued

580
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,695
那么情况会怎样
together so what would be the situation

581
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:32,205
三个硬币哦，将是什么
for three coins ooh what will be the

582
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,225
矩阵中关节中的条目
entries in the joint in the matrix of

583
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,145
联合概率将是什么
joint probabilities what will be the

584
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,215
联合概率所以他们的联合
joint probabilities so they joint the

585
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,255
头部头部的概率我已经
probability of heads heads heads I've

586
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,564
从这三个人看到的头将是1/2
seen heads from all three will be 1/2

587
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:50,354
1/2因为我正在翻转这种沉重的混合物
1/2 because I'm flipping this heavy mix

588
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:58,475
三个硬币在一起我得1/2两次
of three coins together I get 1/2 twice

589
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,024
好吧，其实我这是一个好人
okay actually I this is a good

590
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:07,245
以某种方式介绍张量因素
introduction to tensors in a way because

591
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,395
理解的第一步
the the first step in understanding

592
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,435
张量是考虑三向矩阵
tensors is to think of 3-way matrices

593
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,314
想想你了解我们的三方事物
think of 3-way things what you know we

594
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,255
只是没有那样做，现在我们有
just haven't done that and now we have

595
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,195
这样做，当然还有在哪里或
to do it and of course for where or

596
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:30,435
无论如何，张量现在被理解为好
anyway tensors are now understood okay

597
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,425
所以这些是非常的张量
so this these are tensors with very

598
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,205
特别简单的事情好吧现在我有
special simple things okay so now I have

599
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,574
说什么是协方差矩阵但是
to say what is the covariance matrix but

600
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:46,804
什么是协方差矩阵，所以现在我
what's the covariance matrix so now I'm

601
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,915
准备好了，我会把它放在这里
ready for that and I'll put it here

602
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,045
那是最后一个话题
that's the final topic

603
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:04,805
所以我说的是协方差矩阵
so the covariance matrix so I'm saying

604
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,495
矩阵，因为我只是要有
matrix because I'm just gonna have yeah

605
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,645
协方差矩阵是的，它会去
the covariance matrix yeah it's going to

606
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:20,825
是两个或四个两个硬币所以它是
be two by two or four two coins so it is

607
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:25,864
它将是一个三个硬币的矩阵
a matrix for three coins it will be

608
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:30,005
三乘三，但它是一个矩阵没关系
three by three but it is a matrix okay

609
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,035
那么它是如何定义的，我是什么
so what how is it defined and what am I

610
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,864
打电话给我，我想我会称之为V.
going to call it I think I'll call it V

611
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:39,364
四个因为它真的是关键的想法
for four because it really the key ideas

612
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:44,495
方差协方差告诉我们
variance covariance is is telling us

613
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,745
我们也对此感兴趣
that we're also interested in the

614
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:54,305
委员会联合结果x和ay
committee the joint outcome an x and a y

615
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:59,765
好的，所以这是一个方差，所以我
okay so what so it's a variance so I'm

616
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:05,165
我将加入所有可能的我和
going to add up over all possible I and

617
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:12,685
J对所有可能的结果抱歉
J over all sorry all possible outcomes

618
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:24,455
是的，所有可能的XI和YJ，所以我
yeah all possible X I and YJ so I'm

619
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,005
在这两个实验中运行六个
running the six these two experiments at

620
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:29,795
从实验之一，同时
the same time from experiment one the

621
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,345
输出和X从实验到
outputs and X from experiment to the

622
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:40,685
Y的输出那么PIJ是什么
outputs of Y then what is P I J what

623
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,215
这个符号意味着那就是那个
does that symbol mean that's that's the

624
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,375
在我们的2x2矩阵中，像那个或那个人
guy in our 2x2 matrix like that one or

625
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,625
一个
that one

626
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:56,614
根据胶合或不那么粘
depending on the gluing or not gluing so

627
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:59,945
PIJ这是让我说出这是什么
P IJ this is let me say what it is this

628
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,815
这是X的概率
is this probability that X

629
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,035
是XI和第二个输出
is X I and the second output that this

630
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,495
是YJ，让我给我一个
is YJ and let me give me a second

631
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,955
我要记住的例子
example to keep in mind suppose I'm

632
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,155
看着年龄和身高，所以假设X.
looking at age and height so suppose X

633
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,045
是样本的年龄
is the age of the of the sample the

634
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:34,155
人和Y是我想要的高度
person and Y is the height then I want

635
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,905
我想知道那个分数有多少
to I want to know so what fraction have

636
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,485
一定的年龄和一定的高度是
a certain age and a certain height it's

637
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,885
每一个我都在看着每一对年龄
every I I'm looking at every pair age

638
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,685
身高11岁，身高4英尺
and height age 11 height four feet age

639
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:51,855
12身高5英尺11岁身高4
12 height five feet age 11 height four

640
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:56,115
每个组合五英尺，所以pIJ是
five feet each combination so pIJ is the

641
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,665
这些都会发生的概率
probability that these will both happen

642
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:07,905
既如此有什么事情，你只是我我会
both so what could you just I I'm gonna

643
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,775
在这里添加更多但是那个联合
add more to it here but but that joint

644
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,625
概率非常重要，所以我
probability is really important so I'm

645
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:17,295
会问你更多关于那个假设的问题
gonna ask you more about that suppose

646
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,045
我把这些PIJ和我添加
that I take these P I J's and that I add

647
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:27,225
在其他情况下，P1J加上P2J加上P3J.
up P 1 J plus P 2 J plus P 3 J in other

648
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:32,955
我把pIJx'总结给我，所以我就是这样
words I sum the pIJ x' over I so I'm

649
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,235
看着我的矩阵行的行我这样
looking at a row row I of my matrix so

650
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,045
刚才看到的让我问这个问题
what just saw let me ask the question if

651
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,685
我也许我必须把它放在其他地方
I maybe I have to put it somewhere else

652
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:56,655
什么是什么意味着什么
what is what what means what's the

653
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:05,195
PIJ总和在眼睛上的意义
meaning of the sum of P IJ over the eyes

654
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,395
这个数量是什么样的
what does that quantity look like so

655
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,155
这是一个概率圣战是
that's a probability pIJ is the

656
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,705
得到某个我的概率
probability of getting a certain I on a

657
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,575
某些J，但现在我包括了
certain J but now I'm including

658
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,865
所有的眼睛，所以我在那里看到了什么
all the eyes so what am i seeing there

659
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,095
什么PJ
what PJ

660
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:31,145
谢谢PJ，这就是他的J
thanks PJ this is he J that's the

661
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,535
在第二个看J的概率
probability of seeing J in the second

662
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,905
伙计，因为如果我，我必须看到一些东西
guy because I had to see something if I

663
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,055
在第二个看到J我是被允许的
see J in the second one I I'm allowed to

664
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,335
在第一个看到任何东西但是
see anything here in the first one but

665
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,885
我正在添加所有这些，所以这就是
I'm adding those all up so that's the

666
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,335
点
point

667
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,695
这些会被称为在边缘人
those would be called the marginals in

668
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,345
我的矩阵我会加在一起
my matrices I would be adding up along a

669
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,625
行或将上下柱那些
row or adding up down a column those are

670
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:04,385
称联合的边缘
called the marginal of the joint

671
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,655
概率因此边际将是
probabilities so the marginals would be

672
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,135
个人概率PI和PJ
the individual probabilities P I and PJ

673
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,785
在进行两次实验的情况下
in the case of two experiments going on

674
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,965
与此同时耶就像新
at the same time yeah just like new

675
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,175
今天的想法一切都已经有点
ideas everything today has been sort of

676
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,055
直截了当但不一样好
straightforward but it's different okay

677
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,265
现在我要完成定义
now I'm going to complete the definition

678
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,775
这个协方差矩阵所以它正在发生
of this covariance matrix so it's going

679
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:38,645
是的，我想要一个正方形，所以它
to be it I want to have a square so it's

680
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:44,285
将来，它应该是这样的
going to be and and it should be this is

681
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:48,155
漂亮x和x的平均值意味着一个我
pretty X and the mean of x mean one I

682
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,645
可以把它称为x和y的平均值
could call it a mean of x and y the

683
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:58,205
距Y平均值的距离
distance from the mean of Y times so

684
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,235
这将是列时间相同的行
it's going to be column times a row same

685
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,605
X减XY减去均值的平均值
X minus the mean of X Y minus the mean

686
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:19,305
YXIYJ
of Y X I Y J

687
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:26,065
所以你能不能看看这个公式
so can can you look at this formula so

688
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,245
这是两个两个实验两个
this is with two two experiments two

689
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:34,725
实验两个硬币来实验我
experiments two coins to experiment I

690
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,645
得到一个2乘2的矩阵，每个人都看到了
get a 2 by 2 matrix everybody sees that

691
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:43,095
列乘以2乘2矩阵和
a column times a row 2 by 2 matrix and

692
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,955
让我们只看到这将是一个一个
let's just see what would be the one one

693
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,465
在那个矩阵中输入将会是什么
entry in that matrix what what will in

694
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,065
这是协方差矩阵，那是什么
this is the covariance matrix so what is

695
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,735
在那个矩阵中的一个条目所以
the one one entry in that matrix so the

696
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,835
一个条目来自那个时代
one one entry is coming from that times

697
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,985
这是事情的平方时间
that which is that thing squared times

698
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,675
所有PIJ的这些加起来你是什么
all the P IJ's add them up what do you

699
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,605
我认为我得到了变化
think I get for that I get the variance

700
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:13,675
X实验的标准
of the X experiment the standard

701
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,025
因此VI有X实验的方差
variance of the X experiment so V I have

702
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:22,525
告诉你V现在有什么V这个
to tell you what V is now there V this

703
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:27,835
是V2乘2矩阵在这里我得到了
is V 2 by 2 matrix up here I get the

704
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,015
X实验的方差我该怎么做
variance of the X experiment what do I

705
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,455
在这里得到Y的方差
get down here the variance of the Y

706
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,705
单独进行实验，因为它是明智的x
experiment by itself because it's wise x

707
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,765
明智的，让我这样进入
wise that give me the to to entry so

708
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:44,575
这只是SigmaY平方SigmaY.
this is just Sigma Y squared Sigma Y

709
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:51,775
方可以，但新奇是1/2和
square ok but the novelty is the 1/2 and

710
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,385
它是对称的，所以它是对称的
it'll be symmetric so it's a symmetric

711
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,345
矩阵所以这是V转置我只是我们
matrix so this is V transpose I just we

712
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,305
必须看到这里，所以我已经IJ倍了
have to see here so I've p IJ times the

713
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:07,075
这家伙的距离超过这个家伙
distance of this guy times this guy

714
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,825
这就是将要出现的内容
that's what's going to show up in the

715
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:15,595
1/2位置它将在第1行中
1/2 position it'll be in row 1 that'll

716
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,425
在第2列中，它就是X
be in column 2 it's the X it's the

717
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,005
距离那么那么会是什么的
distances so so what will it be in the

718
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:28,215
脱胶硬币独立硬币的情况
case of unglued coins independent coins

719
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,435
0我的意思是我只是感觉像我一样
0 I mean I was just feeling like 0 I

720
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,875
还没有完成计算
haven't done the computation

721
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,935
但我知道，当我独立时
but I know that when I have independent

722
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,844
实验那么这其中的协方差
experiments then this covariance which

723
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:42,084
每个人都会写作SigmaXY和
everybody would write as Sigma X Y and

724
00:51:42,089 --> 00:51:45,264
在这里它是对称的Sigma
it's the same here it's symmetric Sigma

725
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:48,504
YX如果你喜欢那些那些
YX if you like so that those those

726
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:53,064
下标告诉我总和
subscripts are telling me that the sum

727
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:56,635
豌豆联合概率次数
of the peas joint probabilities times

728
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,244
X从它的距离意味着
the distance of X from its mean the

729
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,945
Y与其平均值的距离加起来
distance of Y from its mean added up

730
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,334
所有可能性都是如此
over all the possibilities so the case

731
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:09,354
在独立的情况下脱胶硬币
of unglued coins in case of independent

732
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,784
在那种情况下那些是0可能是
ones in that case those are 0 may be

733
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:17,484
值得写出你想的
worth just writing that out you would

734
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:22,014
得到0所以你有一个对角矩阵
get 0 so you have a diagonal matrix the

735
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:23,814
对角矩阵就是这样
diagonal matrix is just the very

736
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,794
单独的差异，因为这就是全部
separate variances because that's all

737
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:27,984
两个独立的实验是
the two independent experiments are

738
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:30,804
独立，所以你真的可以期待
independent so all you can really expect

739
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:33,984
信息是Sigmax平方和
to information is Sigma x squared and

740
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:37,104
西格玛Y平方，但如果这两个硬币
Sigma Y squared but if the two coins are

741
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:42,804
粘在一起然后如果两个
glued together then what if the two

742
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:45,175
硬币粘在一起很好让我
coins are glued together well let me

743
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,945
只是说因为时间到了
just say cuz time is up

744
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:50,274
如果这两个矩阵将是单数
this matrix will be singular if the two

745
00:52:50,279 --> 00:52:52,665
硬币粘在一起，这将是
coins were glued together this would be

746
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,244
这里的决定因素是0
the determinant would be 0 here the

747
00:52:56,249 --> 00:53:01,784
胶合情况下的SigmaXY将是
Sigma XY in the glued case would be

748
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:04,945
平方将与西格玛相同
squared would would be the same as Sigma

749
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:10,974
x平方西格玛Y平方实际上我们是
x squared Sigma Y square actually we're

750
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,375
可能得到所有这一个季度
probably getting all these 1 quarters

751
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,574
并且那将是有道理的
and and that would make sense so the the

752
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:22,165
如此，我们就这样结束了
case of a so we just end with this

753
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:27,504
声明这个矩阵是积极的
statement this matrix is positive

754
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:30,895
半定的总是正半
semi-definite always positive semi

755
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,205
确定总是因为它是专栏
definite always because it's column

756
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,804
时间行我们知道这是正半
times row we know that's positive semi

757
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:39,625
明确的，它乘以数字
definite and it's multiplied by numbers

758
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,024
更大等于0所以它是一个组合
greater equals 0 so it's a combination

759
00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:46,044
Rank1正半定的所以它是
of Rank 1 positive semi definite so it's

760
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:46,675
正
positive

761
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,485
它是半定的或肯定的
semi-definite or positive definite it's

762
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,875
肯定是肯定的
certainly positive definite in the

763
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,375
独立的情况，它的对角线和
independent case when it's diagonal and

764
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,995
硬币完全依赖的情况
totally dependent case when the coins

765
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,085
完全粘在一起即会
are completely stuck together that will

766
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:07,215
当这些是半确定的情况
be the semi definite case when these

767
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,185
条目实际上都是相同的
entries would all be the same actually

768
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:14,695
所以这是第一次看协方差
so so that's a first look at covariance

769
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,455
矩阵是第一个引入张量的矩阵
matrices a first it brought in tensors

770
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,765
它带来了联合概率它
it brought in joint probabilities it

771
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,045
引入列时间行
brought in column times row

772
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:26,065
它保持了我们认可的对称带
it kept symmetry band we recognized

773
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,095
正定或正半
positive definite or positive semi

774
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,755
定
definite

775
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,765
所以在部分硬币之间
so in between coins that were partly

776
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,405
胶合部分独立但不是
glued partly independent but not

777
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,435
然后完全独立的实验
completely independent experiments then

778
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,895
这个数字会更小
this number would be smaller the

779
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,375
决定因素将是这不会
determinant would be this wouldn't be

780
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,385
零，但它会小于这些
zero but it would be smaller than these

781
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,785
数字是的没关系
numbers yeah okay

782
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,865
我们跑了四分钟就过去了
we're run four minutes over you're very

783
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,225
善意的说有一个美好的休息
kind to say so have a wonderful break

784
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:59,270
and I'll see you a week from Monday good

785
00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:02,000
我会从星期一见到你好一周

786
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,000
谢谢
thanks
