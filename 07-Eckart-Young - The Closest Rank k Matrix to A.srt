00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,065
所以这是一个非常重要的讲座
so this is a pretty key lecture this

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,585
讲座是关于主要成分的
lecture is about principle component

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,525
分析PCA是其中的主要工具
analysis PCA which is a major tool in in

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,565
了解数据矩阵是什么
understanding a matrix of data so what

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,605
什么是PCA关于首先让我们
what is PCA about well first of all let

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,645
我记得那是什么意思
me remember what was the whole point of

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,975
昨天的讲座少了一些
less yesterday's lecture the singular

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,795
价值分解任何矩阵a
value decomposition that any matrix a

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,675
可以被分成一等级
could be broken into are rank one pieces

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,785
或者是矩阵的等级和每个
or being the rank of the matrix and each

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,345
你有V转置的时间和
piece has you times of V transpose and

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,995
好的特殊之处在于用户
the good special thing is the user

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,915
正交，也是V的
orthonormal and also the V's are also

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,995
正常确定，所以这是整个矩阵，但
normal ok so that's the whole matrix but

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,855
我们有一个很大的矩阵，我们希望得到
we have a big matrix and we want to get

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,865
重要的信息不是
the important information out of it not

25
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,485
所有信息和人们都说如果
all the information and people say if if

26
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,325
如果你已经学会了机器学习
in in machine learning if you've learned

27
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,055
你没有的所有训练数据
all the training data you haven't

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,285
真的学到了什么
learned anything really

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,224
你只是喜欢把它全部复制到你身上
you've just like copied it all in you

30
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:38,614
神经网络的全部意义
the whole point of of neural nets and

31
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:41,985
机器学习的过程就是
the process of machine learning is to

32
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,684
了解有关数据的重要事实
learn important facts about the data and

33
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,614
现在我们处于最基本的阶段
now here we're at the most basic stage

34
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,364
那个和我声称重要的
of that and I claim that the important

35
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:55,544
有关矩阵的事实在其中
facts about the matrix are in its

36
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,215
最大k奇异值最大k
largest k singular values the largest k

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,724
我们可以把k等于1的碎片告诉我们
pieces we can take k equal 1 would tell

38
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,605
我们是最大的单件，但也许我们
us the largest single piece but maybe we

39
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,974
有空间和计算能力来处理
have space and computing power to handle

40
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,914
一百块所以我会把k等于
a hundred pieces so I would take k equal

41
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,115
100
100 the

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,995
矩阵可能已经排了数千，所以我
matrix might have ranked thousands so I

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,044
声称，K是最好的，现在这里的
claim that a K is the best now here's

44
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:28,305
今天的一个定理是K使用
the one theorem for today that a K using

45
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,695
SVD的第一批K片
the first the first K pieces of the SVD

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,005
是等级K的最佳近似值
is the best approximation to a of rank K

47
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,465
所以我会把它写下来就是这样
so I'll write that down so that's that

48
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,245
真的说为什么SVD完美没问题
really says why the SVD is perfect okay

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,204
所以那个声明说如果是的话
so that's that statement says that if if

50
00:02:50,209 --> 00:03:01,425
是另一个矩阵有等级K然后
be another matrix has rank K then the

51
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,454
从A到B的距离是你的错误
distance from A to B the error you're

52
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,844
只使用B就是错误
making in just using B that error is

53
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,145
大于或等于错误你
greater than or equal to the error you

54
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:17,085
做出最好的指导，这是一个
make for the best guidance so that's a

55
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,475
非常直白的事实
pretty straightforward beautiful fact

56
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,035
并且它可以追溯到的人谁
and it goes back to people who

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,555
首先发现了SVD
discovered the SVD in the first place

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,445
但后来有几位心理学家给了
but then a couple of psychologists gave

59
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,365
在后来的论文中经常提供证明
a proof in a later paper and it's often

60
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,615
称为Eckert年轻定理
called the Eckert young theorem

61
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,495
那个定理不是那个
there's the theorem isn't that

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,975
直截了当，假设是
straightforward and the hypothesis is

63
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,405
直截了当，但非常好
straightforward that's pretty nice but

64
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,374
当然，我们必须考虑为什么会这样
of course we have to think why is it

65
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,645
为什么它是真的并赋予意义
true why is it true and to give meaning

66
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,925
对于定理，我们必须说出这些
to the theorem we have to say what these

67
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,014
双杠是你知道的吗？
double bars are do you know the right

68
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,374
这个名称，以便双杠
name for this so that double bar around

69
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:15,014
矩阵称为矩阵的范数
a matrix is called the the norm of the

70
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,145
我必须说，矩阵是常态
matrix the norm so I have to say

71
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,245
关于矩阵规范的东西
something about matrix norms

72
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,575
这有多大是衡量有多大的尺度
how big is that's a measure of how big

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,325
它是，我要说的是
it is and what I have to say is

74
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,184
a有许多不同的衡量标准
there are many different measures of a

75
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,094
矩阵有多大矩阵让我
matrix how large that matrix is let me

76
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,664
今天告诉你三个可能
tell you for today three possible

77
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:40,884
矩阵的测量方式如此不同
measures of a matrix so different ways

78
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,714
测量和我，我会称之为矩阵
to measure and me I'll call the matrix

79
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:46,795
只是一个可能，但我会申请
just a maybe but then I'm gonna apply

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,205
衡量减去B和减去
the measure to a minus B and to a minus

81
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,615
一个K和显示，这是小
a K and show that that is the smaller

82
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,684
好的，所以我要告诉你关于
okay so I'm on to tell you about the

83
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,944
关于一些可能的规范的规范
norm of a about some possible norms of a

84
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,185
实际上我将要采取的规范
and actually the norms I'm going to take

85
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,185
今天将有这个特别的
today will be will have this special

86
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,455
他们可以找到计算的功能
feature that they can be found computed

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,305
通过他们的奇异价值让我
by their singular values so let me

88
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,645
提到的是l2规范
mention the the l2 norm that is the

89
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,944
最大的奇异值，所以这是一个
largest singular value so that's an

90
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,985
排序的重要措施
important measure of the sort of the

91
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,395
矩阵的大小我在这里说话是的
size of a matrix I'm talking here yeah

92
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,175
关于一般M乘n矩阵sigma
about a general M by n matrix a sigma

93
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,705
一个是经常是一个重要的规范
one is the is an important norm often

94
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,015
称为l2规范，那就是那个地方
called the l2 norm and that's where that

95
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,075
索引2去哦我应该真的开始
index 2 goes oh I should really start

96
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,865
用向量规范的向量然后
with vectors norms of vectors and then

97
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,444
建立两个矩阵规范让我做
build two norms of matrices let me do

98
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,205
这方面的向量规范
norms of vectors over on this side the

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,485
l2矢量的范数我们知道那是什么
l2 norm of a vector do we know what that

100
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,355
这是常规的长度
is that's the regular length of the

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,735
我们都期待广场的矢量
vector that we all expect the square

102
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:14,935
v1的平方正方形到VN平方
root of v1 squared up to VN square the

103
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,935
斜边斜边的长度
hypotenuse the length of the hypotenuse

104
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,694
在n维空间中，即l2
in n-dimensional space that's the l2

105
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,334
正因为如此，以a的L1规范标准
norm because of that to the l1 norm of a

106
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,714
矢量只是加起来那些碎片
vector is just add up those pieces

107
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,805
没有平方和平方根
without squaring and square rooting them

108
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,815
只需添加它们就是l1规范
just add them that's the l1 norm

109
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,525
你可能会说我们为什么要这样做
and you might say why do we want to

110
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,305
规范还是有更多的规范让我
norms or there are more norms let me

111
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,475
再告诉你一个无限规范
just tell you one more the infinity norm

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,385
并有对的人;一个理由
and there's a reason for the one and the

113
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,085
两个和无穷大是最大的
two and the infinity is the largest of

114
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,475
野兽没关系
the beasts okay

115
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,455
在我不知道之前你有没有见过规范？
have you met norms before I don't know

116
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,945
这些是矢量规范，但也许你
these are vector norms but maybe you

117
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,135
已经遇到了我们将要有矩阵
have met then we're going to have matrix

118
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:14,105
规范，也许会有新的，所以这是
norms that maybe will be new so this is

119
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,705
我们通常会想到的规范但是
the norm that we usually think of but

120
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,255
这个真的变了
this one has become really really

121
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,865
很重要，让我告诉你原因
important and let me tell you just why

122
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,985
然后我们的后面的章节
and then we'll a later section of the

123
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,935
本课程的笔记和后续讲座
notes and a later lecture in this course

124
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,525
我们将开发这个开发这个
we'll develop that develop this this is

125
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,475
l1范数所以这是l2l1和L.
the l1 norm so this is l2 l1 and L

126
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,905
无限有啥特别之处
infinity so what's special about this

127
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,905
一个好，它刚刚结束，它是
one well it just turned out and it was

128
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,005
只发现你知道我们的
only discovered you know in our

129
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,275
你最小化一些的生命周期
lifetimes that when you minimize some

130
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,615
使用你所在的l1范数的函数
function using the l1 norm you're in a

131
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,215
最小化一些说信号噪音或
minimize some say signal noise or

132
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,115
无论如何最小化某些功能
whatever you minimize some function if

133
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,445
你使用l1获胜的矢量了
you use l1 the winning vector the

134
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,005
最小化矢量变得稀疏
minimizing vector turns out to be sparse

135
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,575
什么稀疏意味着稀疏意味着什么
and what a sparse mean sparse means

136
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,475
我当时以某种方式大多数是0组件
mostly 0 components somehow when I

137
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,045
在l2中最小化哪个是
minimize in l2 which which is

138
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,655
历史上可以追溯到高斯了
historically goes back to Gauss the

139
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,655
有史以来最伟大的时数学家
greatest mathematician of all time when

140
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,605
你最小化你做的事情
you minimize something in l2 you do

141
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,615
最小的方块，你发现那个人
least squares and you find that the guy

142
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,445
给你最小的东西有很多
that gives you the minimum has a lot of

143
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,935
小数字很少
little numbers a lot of little

144
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,855
组件，因为当你平方那些
components because when you square those

145
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,274
小家伙，他们
little ones they they

146
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,814
不伤害很多，但女生如此盛会没
don't hurt much but gals so galas didn't

147
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:01,485
至少l1规范有不同
do least l1 norm that has different

148
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,725
命名基础追求而且它来了
names basis pursuit and and it comes

149
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:13,634
进入信号处理和传感权利
into signal processing and sensing right

150
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,684
然后发现如果你
and then it was discovered that if you

151
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:23,595
最小化，因为我们会在那个规范中看到你
minimize as we'll see in that norm you

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,235
令人惊讶地得到了获胜的矢量
amazingly get the winning vector has

153
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,175
多大多是零和优势
much mostly zeros and the advantage of

154
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,694
那就是你可以理解它是什么
that is that you can understand what its

155
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,834
组件是很多小的组件
components are the one with many small

156
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,514
你不喜欢他们的组件
components you're like he have no

157
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,905
该答案的解释，但为
interpretation for that answer but for

158
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,944
答案只有一些非零
an answer that just has a few nonzero

159
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:47,804
组件你真的看到了什么
components you really see what's

160
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:50,235
发生，然后这是一个重要的
happening and then this is a important

161
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,384
一个也好，现在我要转向
one too ok ok now I'm gonna turn just to

162
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,264
那么规范的特性是什么呢？
so what's the property of a norm well

163
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,285
你可以看到C次的规范
you can see that the norm of C times a

164
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,694
向量只乘以6或11或
vector is just multiplying by 6 or 11 or

165
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:13,624
减去pi或C的大小
minus pi or whatever is the size of C

166
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,045
规范有很好的属性他们
norms have that nice property they're

167
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,804
他们是同质的，或者无论如何
they're homogeneous or whatever word if

168
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,175
你仔细考虑你应该加倍的矢量
you mull the vector you should double

169
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,064
那个长度加倍的规范
the norm that double the length that

170
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:27,465
有道理然后重要
makes sense and then the important

171
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,394
属性是那个着名的三角形
property is that is the famous triangle

172
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:38,415
不平等，如果你是V和W
inequality that if you if V and W are

173
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,624
三角形的两边你拿走了
two sides of a triangle and you take the

174
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:43,995
V的规范并加上W的规范
norm of V and add to the norm of W the

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,384
双方得到的不仅仅是直线
two sides you get more than the straight

176
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,014
沿斜边的规范是的，所以那些
norm along the hypotenuse yeah so those

177
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,595
是我们需要的属性和与
are properties that we require and and

178
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,324
并且，事实上，规范的
and and the fact that the norm is

179
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:00,374
这是积极的，我不会写下来
positive which is I won't write down but

180
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:03,045
这很重要，所以那些
it's important to okay so those are

181
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,235
规范和那些也适用于
norms and those will apply also to

182
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,915
领班
maitre

183
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,675
Norm是如此，如果我加倍我想要的矩阵
Norm's so if I double the matrix I want

184
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,245
加倍其规范，当然也是如此
to double its norm and of course that

185
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,905
适用于墓葬规范和实际上
works for the tomb norm and actually

186
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,555
大概如此三角不等式
probably so the triangle inequality for

187
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,495
这种规范是最大的
this norm is saying that the largest

188
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,795
加号B两个矩阵的奇异值
singular value of a plus B two matrices

189
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,575
小于或等于最大的单数
is less or equal to the largest singular

190
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,005
a的值加上最大的奇异值
value of a plus the largest singular

191
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,815
B的价值，这是我们不会采取的
value of B and that's we we won't take

192
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,395
上课时间来检查它
class time to check minor it

193
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,295
这样的直截了当的事情
straightforward things like that

194
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,235
所以现在我要继续这样做
so now I'm gonna continue with that

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,155
我想告诉你的三个规范
three norms that I want to tell you

196
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,035
关于这是一个非常重要的一个再
about that's a very important one then

197
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,295
还有另一个被命名为的标准
there's another norm that's named as an

198
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,305
F和它的名字来自BGnaeus
F and it's named after fro B Gnaeus

199
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,635
对于那个很抱歉
sorry about that

200
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,705
什么是规范所关注的规范
and what is that norm that norm looks at

201
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,495
矩阵中的所有条目就像
all the entries in the matrix just like

202
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,675
它是一个长矢量并将它们平方
it was a long vector and squares them

203
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,345
所有并以某种方式将它们加起来
all and adds them up so in a way it's

204
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,915
就像矢量的两个标准一样
like the two norm for a vector it's so

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,735
平方或我应该放平方根
the squared or shall I put square root

206
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,555
也许我应该是它的平方根
maybe I should it's the square root of

207
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,325
矩阵中的所有小人物
all the little people in in the matrix

208
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,895
所以将1N的平方加上下一一个21
so a 1 n squared plus the next a 2 1

209
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,985
平方等等你终于到了M.
squared and so on you finally get to a M

210
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,245
ñ平方你你你刚才对待
N squared you you all you just treat the

211
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,735
矩阵就像一个长向量并采取这个
matrix like a long vector and take this

212
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,775
平方根就像这样
square root just just like so that's

213
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,925
这就是弗罗贝尼乌斯的规范然后
that's the Frobenius norm and then

214
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,895
终于没不那么有名的是
finally not not so well known is

215
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,445
更像是L的东西
something that's more like L one it's

216
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,745
称核规范
called the nuclear norm

217
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,595
而不是所有的教员都知道
and not all the faculty would know about

218
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,704
这个核规范所以是它的总和
this nuclear norm so it is the sum of

219
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:27,405
我想是奇异值的西格玛
the Sigma of the singular values I guess

220
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,655
它们就是我们所在的地方
there are of them so that's where we

221
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,314
会停下来哦好吧
would stop oh okay

222
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:39,915
所以这三个规范现在为什么要这样做
so those are three norms now why why do

223
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,774
我选择这三个规范和
I pick on those three norms and and

224
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,134
对于那些人来说，这是重点
here's the point that though for those

225
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,514
三个规范这个陈述是真的我
three norms this statement is true I

226
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,465
可以制定其他矩阵规范
could cook up other matrix norms for

227
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,045
这本是行不通的，但这些
which this wouldn't work but for these

228
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,735
三个高度重要的规范这个
three highly important norms this

229
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,434
EckhartJung声称最接近
Eckhart Jung statement that the closest

230
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:04,845
等级K近似值来自于
rank K approximation is found from the

231
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,785
先是K件，是的，你看到的是
first K pieces yeah you see that's a

232
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,365
好事，因为这就是我们
good thing because this is what we

233
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,715
从SVD计算，现在我们已经解决了
compute from the SVD so now we've solved

234
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,115
我们发现了近似问题
an approximation problem we found the

235
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,485
Benham最好的B是K和重点
Benham the best B is a K and the point

236
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,754
是否可以使用所有这些
is it could use all the any of those

237
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,624
规范所以会有一个好人
norms so there would be a well somebody

238
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,264
终于想出了一个证据
finally came up with a proof that would

239
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,985
，做所有这三个准则一次在
that does all three norms at once in the

240
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,444
笔记我做一个分开
notes I do that one separately from

241
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,995
Frobenius，实际上我在麻省理工学院找到了
Frobenius and actually I found in an MIT

242
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,624
论文只是我刚读了一门课程
thesis just I was just reading a course

243
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:54,345
六篇博士论文和作者是谁
six PhD thesis and the author who's

244
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,334
明天和周五的演讲
speaking tomorrow in and or Friday in in

245
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:08,054
idss博士cerebro找到了一个很好的新证明
idss dr. cerebro found a nice new proof

246
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:10,485
弗罗贝尼乌斯，它在笔记中
of Frobenius and it's in the notes as

247
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,035
以及更老的证据你知道吗
well as the an older proof okay you know

248
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,475
我在这里说话时我不太确定
as I talk here I'm not too sure whether

249
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,355
这对我来说是必不可少的
it is essential for me to go through the

250
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,295
证明
proof

251
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,065
或者在l2范数内，需要一半
either in the l2 norm which takes half a

252
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,885
笔记中的页面或Frobenius中的页面
page in the notes or in the Frobenius

253
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,055
需要更多的规范，我宁愿你看
norm which takes more I'd rather you see

254
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,805
重点在于这些
the point the point is that in these

255
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,355
规范，现在有什么特别之处
norms and now what is special about

256
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,825
这些依赖的矩阵规范
these norms of a matrix these depend

257
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,545
只有他们的西格玛只有这个哦
only on their Sigma's only on this oh

258
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,865
我会完成那句话，因为它是
I'll finish that sentence because it was

259
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,465
这些规范仅仅依赖于这些规范
true these these norms depend only on

260
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,185
奇异的价值吧
the singular values right

261
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,045
那一个至少只取决于一个
that one at least depends only on a

262
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,625
奇异值这是最大的一个
singular value it's the largest one this

263
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,235
一个是这一切的总和
one is the sum of them all this one

264
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,905
进入Netflix比赛
comes into the Netflix competition by

265
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,235
这是赢得正确规范的方式
the way this was the right norm to win

266
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,975
在Netflix的数不胜数美元
zillion dollars in the Netflix

267
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,915
竞争那么Netflix就是这么说的
competition so what did Netflix put it

268
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:27,205
做过电影的数学竞赛
did a math competition it had movie

269
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,285
来自许多Netflix的偏好
preferences from many many Netflix

270
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,845
订阅者将他们的排名归结为
subscribers they gave their ranking to a

271
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,845
一堆电影，但当然他们
bunch of movies but of course they

272
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,095
没见过没有人见过全部
hadn't seen No none of them had seen all

273
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,795
电影所以排名矩阵
the movies so the matrix of rankings

274
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,795
你有怨恨和矩阵的地方
where you had the rancor and the matrix

275
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,925
是一个非常大的矩阵，但它有
was a very big matrix but it's got

276
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,405
如果怨恨没有看到错过的条目
missing entries if the rancor didn't see

277
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,205
电影
the movie

278
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,025
他不是他或她没有这么排名
he isn't he or she isn't ranking it so

279
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,935
关于Netflix的想法是什么呢？
what's the idea about Netflix so they

280
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,555
提供了一百万美元的奖金
offered a like a million dollar prize

281
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,465
还有很多数学和计算机科学
and a lot of math and computer science

282
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,475
人们为这个奖项而奋战
people fought for that prize and over

283
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,075
他们得到的年份更高929394
the years they got like higher 92 93 94

284
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,584
正确的百分比，但事实证明
percent right so but it turned out that

285
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,395
你最不得不这样做
this was well you had to in the end you

286
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,885
不得不用一点心理学的方法
had to use a little psychology of how

287
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,645
人们投了票，所以部分是关于
people voted so it was partly about

288
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,925
人类心理学，但它也是一个非常
human psychology but it was also a very

289
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,135
不完整的大矩阵问题
large matrix problem with an incomplete

290
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,495
矩阵一个不完整的矩阵，所以它
matrix an incomplete matrix and so it

291
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,235
已经完成，你必须身材
had to be completed you had to figure

292
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,445
什么会
out what would

293
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,955
如果他的话，排名者已经对这个帖子说过了
ranker have said about the post if he

294
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,695
没有看到它，但排名你知道
hadn't seen it but had ranked you know

295
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,325
其他几部电影像所有的
several other movies like all the

296
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,865
总统的男人或任何给予的人
President's Men or whatever given a

297
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,025
排名到你必须的那个和那个
ranking to those you have to and that's

298
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,005
当然是一个推荐系统
a recommender system of course that's

299
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,775
这是怎么得到建议的
what that's how you get recommendations

300
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,995
来自亚马逊
from from Amazon

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,985
他们有一个很大的矩阵计算
they've got a big matrix calculation

302
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,745
在这里，如果你已经买了几个
here and if you've bought a couple of

303
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,115
数学书他们会告诉你的
math books they're gonna tell you about

304
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,485
更多的数学书比你更想
more math books more than you want to

305
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,265
知道的没事
know all right

306
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,445
是的，所以无论如何它只是结果
yeah okay so anyway it just turned out

307
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,585
这个规范是正确的
that this norm was the right one to

308
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,955
最小化我不能给你所有的
minimize I can't give you all the

309
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,415
Netflix的竞争的详细信息，但
details of the Netflix competition but

310
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,335
这被证明是正确的标准来
this turned out to be the right norm to

311
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,725
至少做一个最小的问题
do a minimum problem a best not least

312
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,065
正方形这些正方形会看一些
squares these squares would look at some

313
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,615
其他规范，但最好的核规范
other norm but a best nuclear norm

314
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,535
完成矩阵和现在
completion of the matrix and and and now

315
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,525
这是一个如此现在它被放了很多
it's a so now it's being put to much

316
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,645
用于MRI磁场的更严重的用途
more serious uses from for MRI magnetic

317
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,465
当你离开时，你知道的共鸣
resonance stuff you know when you're go

318
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,335
并且让你这是一个嘈杂的系统但是
in and get you it's a noisy system but

319
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:15,015
你得到它它给出了一个很好的图片
you get it it gives a excellent picture

320
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,055
发生了什么，所以我只是
of of what's going on so so I'll just

321
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,375
在这里写netflix就可以了
write netflix here so it gets in this

322
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,785
然后核磁共振有啥关于点
and then MRIs so what's the point about

323
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:37,185
核磁共振成像，如果你没有，如果你长时间停留
MRIs so if you don't if you stay in long

324
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,555
够了，你得到了你得到了你
enough you gotta come you get a you got

325
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,385
所有的数字都不是没有的
all the numbers aren't any there isn't

326
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,805
缺少数据，但如果你是一个孩子
missing data but if you was with a child

327
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,385
你可能想让孩子进来
you might want to just have the child in

328
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,445
几分钟然后这还不够
for a few minutes then that's not enough

329
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,225
得到一个完整的图片，你有一个
to get a complete picture and you have a

330
00:19:53,230 --> 00:20:02,525
你的矩阵中缺少数据
and missing data in your matrix of in

331
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,885
你的MRI中的图像是这样的
your your in the image from the MRI so

332
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,255
当然，你必须完成
then of course you've got to complete

333
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,445
那个矩阵你必须填写什么
that matrix you have to fill in what

334
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,595
MRI将会看到什么
would the what would the MRI have seen

335
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,985
在那些看起来没有的位置
in those positions where it didn't look

336
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,625
足够长，又是一个核规范
long enough and again a nuclear norm is

337
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,575
好的，好的
the good one for that okay

338
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,044
所以那里会有一个整体
so there's there there will be a whole

339
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:35,674
关于规范的部分可能就在其中
section on norms maybe just about in in

340
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:42,294
现在很好，所以我不会
stellar by now okay so I'm not going to

341
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,755
让我说一下这是什么
let me just say like what does this what

342
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,205
这会告诉我们这是什么意思吗？
does this say what does this tell us

343
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,655
所以我只是举一个例子，也许我会
so I'll just give an example maybe I'll

344
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,325
从这个例子开始
take start start with the example that's

345
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,794
在笔记中假设K是2所以我是
in the notes suppose K is 2 so I'm

346
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,735
在所有等级两个矩阵中寻找
looking of among all rank two matrices

347
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,405
并假设我的矩阵是4321和所有
and suppose my matrix is 4 3 2 1 and all

348
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:17,914
剩下的零点，它是排名4
the rest zeroes diag and it's a rank 4

349
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,095
矩阵我可以看到它的奇异值
matrix I can see it singular values

350
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,205
坐在那里
there sitting there

351
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,755
这些将是奇异值和
those would be the singular values and

352
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,495
本征值和一切
the eigen values and everything of

353
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,685
当然，现在这将是一个2会是什么
course now what would be a 2 what would

354
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,785
是秩2的最佳近似值
be the best approximation of Rank 2 to

355
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:42,815
从这个意义上说，这个矩阵是
that matrix in in this sense to be

356
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,885
完成了将要做的事情
completed what would a to do yeah it

357
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,985
将是4和3它将挑选两个
would be 4 and 3 it would pick the two

358
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,885
最大的，所以我在寻找一个K-8，这是
largest so I'm looking at a k-8 this is

359
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,585
2斗篷所以它必须有一个2级
cape of the 2 so it has to have a rank 2

360
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,765
这已经获得了最大的排名
this has got rank for the biggest pieces

361
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,745
是那些
are those

362
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,755
好吧所以这件事说如果我有的话
okay so this thing says that if I had

363
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,325
任何其他矩阵B它会更进一步
any other matrix B it would be further

364
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,625
远离比这家伙说，这
away from a than this guy says that this

365
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,515
是最接近的，我只是想能
is the closest and I just like could

366
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,435
你能想到一个可能的矩阵吗？
could you think of a matrix that could

367
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,674
可能越走越排至
possibly be closer and be ranked to that

368
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,885
排名二是棘手的事情了
rank two is the tricky thing the the

369
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,705
等级2的矩阵形成一种疯狂
matrices of Rank 2 form a kind of crazy

370
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,215
如果我将Rank2矩阵添加到Rank2，则设置
set if I add a Rank 2 matrix to a Rank 2

371
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,935
矩阵
matrix

372
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,355
可能排名高达4，所以
probably the rank is up to 4 so so the

373
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,565
等级2矩阵都是浮动的
rank 2 matrices are all kind of floating

374
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,845
在他们自己的一点点
around and little in their own little

375
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,775
角落这看起来是最好的一个但是
corners this looks like the best one but

376
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,924
在笔记中我建议你可以
in the notes I suggest well you could

377
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:55,585
获得排名交配秩我可以或
get a rank to mate a rank I could or

378
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,085
怎么样B这个BI怎么样？
what about B what about this B I for

379
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,395
这家伙我可以靠近了
this guy I could get closer

380
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,034
也许不是确切的，但可能更接近
maybe not exact but closer maybe by

381
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:16,044
服用3.53.5哦但我只想用
taking 3.5 3.5 oh but I only want to use

382
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:18,235
排名很好，我只得排名2
rank well I've only got to rank 2 to

383
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,265
玩耍所以我最好把它变成一个
play with so I better make this into a

384
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,605
我必须要把它变成一个
right I have to like make this into a

385
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,025
排名第一，然后是2和1
rank one piece and then the 2 and the 1

386
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,595
所以你看到的我已经什么，我想我
so you see what I've what I thought of I

387
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,385
以为男人也许这就像更好
thought man maybe that's better like on

388
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,705
对角线我越来越近我了
the diagonal I'm coming closer well I'm

389
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,105
没有完全在这里，但后来
not getting it exactly here but then

390
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,385
我还有一个可以玩，我会
I've got one left to play with and I'll

391
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:51,294
把这可能1.5放在这里好吧这是一个
put maybe 1.5 down here ok so that's a

392
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,005
等级2矩阵2小等级和等级
rank 2 matrix 2 little rank ones and on

393
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,495
对角线它更好三分
the diagonal it's better three-point

394
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,125
五点我只丢1/2点一点
fives I'm only missing by 1/2 one point

395
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,164
5s我失踪了一半，所以我只是
5s I'm missing by half so I'm only

396
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,565
在对角线上失踪了一半
missing by half on the diagonal where

397
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,674
这家伙失踪了2所以也许我已经失踪了
this guy was missing by 2 so maybe I've

398
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,115
找到了更好的东西，但我不得不付钱
found something better but I had to pay

399
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,725
这些东西的价格已经濒临死亡
a price of these things off the dying

400
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,735
保持排名低，他们杀了我
to keep the ranked low and they kill me

401
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,395
所以将远离a
so that be will be further away from a

402
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,595
如果我计算了减去B和的错误
the error if I computed a minus B and

403
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,385
计算它的规范我会看到更大
computed its norm I would see bigger

404
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,505
所以你看，比大于a-a-ÿà更大
than bigger than a - a - ÿà so you see

405
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,245
那是那个定理的重点
the point of the theorem that's that's

406
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,465
真的是我想说的是
really what I'm trying to say that it is

407
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,285
不太明显你可能会感觉良好
not obvious you may you may feel well

408
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,855
选择四和三是完全明显的
it's totally obvious pick four and three

409
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,405
还有什么可以做到的，但这取决于
what else could do it but it depends on

410
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,185
规范等等所以它不是库尔特
the norm and so on so it's not a Kurt

411
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,155
年轻人不得不考虑一个证明和其他
Young had to think of a proof and other

412
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,475
人们也没关系，这样现在，但你
people too okay so that's now but you

413
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,585
也可以说我开始说的对象
could say also say object that I started

414
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,595
这里有一个对角矩阵
with a diagonal matrix here that's so

415
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,235
特别，但我想说的是
special but what I want to say is the

416
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,655
对角矩阵并不那么特别
diagonal matrix is not that special

417
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:21,055
因为我可以接受，所以让我怀疑
because I could take a so let me doubt

418
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,145
只要调用这个对角矩阵D哦
just call this diagonal matrix D oh let

419
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,145
我把它称为西格玛给它另一种
me call it Sigma to give it another sort

420
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:34,165
适当的名字，如果我想的话
of appropriate name so like if I thought

421
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,905
矩阵我想说的是这个
of matrices what I want to say is this

422
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,075
可能是西格玛基质和有
could be the Sigma matrix and there

423
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,465
可能是你左边的一个和一个
could be a you on the left of it and a

424
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,365
西格玛在右边就这样了
Sigma on the right of it so so about a

425
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,565
suSigmaV转置所以这是我的Sigma
su Sigma V transpose so this is my Sigma

426
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:59,215
这就像任何正交矩阵U.
and this is like any orthogonal matrix U

427
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:09,265
这就像任何V转置权一样
and this is like any V transpose right

428
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,935
我只是说这里还有很多
I'm just saying here's a whole lot more

429
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,785
矩阵只有一个矩阵，但现在
matrices there's just one matrix but now

430
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,935
我有所有这些矩阵使用
I have all these matrices with use

431
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,095
乘以左边和V转置
multiplying on the left and V transpose

432
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,855
在右边这样，我问你这个
on so on the right and I ask you this

433
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,915
质疑什么是奇异的价值观
question what are the singular values of

434
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,935
这个矩阵在这里是奇异值
that matrix a here the singular values

435
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,795
很清楚四三两个和一个
were clear four three two and one

436
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,225
这个的奇异价值是什么？
what are the singular values of this

437
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,295
矩阵a，当我乘以a
matrix a when I've multiplied by a

438
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,035
两边的正交人是一个
orthogonal guy on both sides that's a

439
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,795
关键问题是什么是单数
key question what are the singular

440
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,025
价值一四四二一
values of that one four three two one

441
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,795
没有改变为什么那是因为
didn't change why is that because the

442
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,345
奇异值是因为这有
singular values are the because this has

443
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,875
SVD形式正交对角线
a SVD form orthogonal times diagonal

444
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,035
正交和对角线的时间
times orthogonal and that diagonal

445
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,555
包含我所知的奇异值
contains the singular values what I'm

446
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,095
说这可能是一个小时的琐碎
saying is that might an hour trivial

447
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,905
这里的小例子实际上就是全部
little example here actually was all

448
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,085
四乘具有这些奇异的四肢
four by fours that have these singular

449
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,395
价值我可以解决我的问题
values I could my whole problem is

450
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,795
正交e不变tamasic我会
orthogonal e invariant tamasic I would

451
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,975
当我乘以U或V时说
say when I multiply by U or a V

452
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,285
转置或两者都没有问题
transpose or both the problem doesn't

453
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,655
改变规范不改变是啊那是一个
change norms don't change yeah that's a

454
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,955
点是的，我知道现在是这样的
point yeah I realize it now this is the

455
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,705
如果我将矩阵a乘以
point if I multiply the matrix a by by

456
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,315
正交矩阵U它具有全部
an orthogonal matrix U it has all the

457
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,385
相同的规范并没有改变常态
same norms doesn't change the norm

458
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,515
实际上这是真正的回归
actually that was true way back for

459
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,115
与该长度与该载体
vectors with with this length with this

460
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,915
长度
length

461
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,015
什么是关于矢量的交易假设我
what's the deal about vectors suppose I

462
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,115
假设我有一个向量V和我
suppose I have a vector V and I've

463
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,565
计算了它的斜边和规范
computed its hypotenuse and the norm and

464
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,725
现在我在同样的两个中看Q倍V
now I look at Q times V in that same two

465
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:14,985
规范什么是特别的
norm what's what's special about that

466
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,025
所以我拿了任何矢量V而且我知道什么
so I took any vector V and I know what

467
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,415
它的长度是斜边
it's length is hypotenuse

468
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,655
现在我乘以Q会发生什么
now I multiply by Q what happens to the

469
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:30,915
长度不变不变
length doesn't change doesn't change

470
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,145
正交矩阵，你可以想到它
orthogonal matrix you could think of it

471
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,575
就像旋转三角形一样
as just like rotating the triangle in

472
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,245
空间的斜边不会改变
space the hypotenuse doesn't change and

473
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,385
我们检查过，因为我们可以
we've checked that because we could you

474
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,095
知道检查是对它和
know the check is to square it and

475
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,945
你正在做QV转置QV和
and you're doing Q V transpose Q V and

476
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,095
你把它简化通常的方式，然后
you simplify it the usual way and then

477
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,375
你有Q转置Q等于
you have Q transpose Q equal the

478
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,455
身份，你是金色的，所以
identity and you're golden yeah so the

479
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:09,325
结果是你得到与V相同的答案
result is you get the same answer as V

480
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:16,044
所以让我把它放在句子中暂停
so let me put it in a sentence now pause

481
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:21,965
乘以该规范不会改变
multiplying the that norm is not changed

482
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,345
通过正交矩阵和这些规范是
by orthogonal matrix and these norms are

483
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,115
没有被正交矩阵改变
not changed by orthogonal matrices

484
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,935
因为如果我把a乘以一个
because if I multiply the a here by an

485
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,455
正交矩阵我有这个是我的
orthogonal matrix I I have this is my a

486
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,414
如果我乘以Q而我有Qu
if I multiply by by a Q and I have Q u

487
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:44,105
SigmaV转置，真正的是什么
Sigma V transpose and what is the really

488
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,975
qu是一个基本点
the underlying point that qu is an

489
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,674
正交矩阵和你一样好
orthogonal matrix just as good as you

490
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:57,025
那么，如果我把这个QA放下来会是Q
so what if I put this down QA would be Q

491
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:02,164
你使用西格玛V转换，现在我问
u Sigma V transpose and now I'm asking

492
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:05,135
你有什么奇特的价值
you what's the singular value

493
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,904
质量保证的分解，我希望我可以
decomposition for QA and I hope I may

494
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:13,265
实际上看到它是什么单数
actually see it what's the singular

495
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,115
QA的价值分解是什么
value decomposition of QA what are the

496
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,435
他们的价值观是什么
thing of their values what's the

497
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,935
对角矩阵只是看那里
diagonal matrix just look there for it

498
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,755
对角矩阵是西格玛，是什么
the diagonal matrix is Sigma what's the

499
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,495
V转置右侧
goes on the right of it the V transpose

500
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,174
它的左边是Qu
and what goes on the left of it is Q u

501
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,645
因为这是正交时间
because that's orthogonal times

502
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,955
在这个房间里正交每个人都有
orthogonal everybody in this room has to

503
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,685
知道如果我乘以两个正交
know that if I multiply two orthogonal

504
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,595
矩阵结果再次正交
matrices the result is again orthogonal

505
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,505
所以我可以乘以Q而且它只是
so I can multiply by Q and it only

506
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,015
影响U部分不是Sigma
affects that the U part not the Sigma

507
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,595
部分，所以它不会改变任何
part and so it doesn't change any of

508
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,185
那些
those

509
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,884
Norm没关系，所以没关系
Norm's okay so that's fine

510
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:57,774
这就是我想说的
that's what I wanted to say about the

511
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,554
埃克特年轻定理没有证明这一点但是
Eckert young theorem not proving it but

512
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,435
但希望能给你一个例子
but hopefully giving you an example

513
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,134
那意味着这是什么意思
there of what it means that that this is

514
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:14,414
接近那一个的最佳等级
the best rank to to approximate that one

515
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:24,325
还好，这样的背后PCA关键数学等等
okay so that's key math behind PCA so

516
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,414
现在我想缺口它不只是
now I have to want to notch it not just

517
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,835
不得不想告诉你有关PCA的事
have to but want to tell you about PCA

518
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,935
那是什么呢？
so what's what's that about

519
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,485
所以我们有一堆数据，我们想要
so we have a bunch of data and we want

520
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,105
看到这个让我拿出一堆数据
to see so let me take a bunch of data

521
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:47,424
一堆数据点说出了分数
bunch of data points say points in the

522
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:50,514
飞机所以我有一堆数据点
plane so I have a bunch of data points

523
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,325
在飞机上所以这是我的数据向量
in the plane so here's my data vector

524
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,615
第一个向量XY井X是一个好的
first vector X Y well X is that a good

525
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,654
也许V这些只是两个组成部分
maybe V one these are just two component

526
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,975
伙计我也是他们只是专栏
guys me too they're just columns with

527
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,164
两个组件，所以我只是在测量
two components so I'm I'm just measuring

528
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:15,115
喜欢高度和年龄，我想找到
like height and age and I want to find

529
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,455
身高与年龄的关系
the relationship between height and age

530
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,815
所以第一行是指高度
so the first row is meant is the height

531
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,164
我的数据和第二行是
of my data and the second row is the

532
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:28,404
所以这些都是如此，所以我说了一个
ages so these are so so I've got say a

533
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:34,014
很多人这些都是高度和
lot of people these are the heights and

534
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:41,695
这些是年龄，我有n分
these are the ages and I've got n points

535
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,985
在2d
in 2d

536
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,625
而且我想从中理解我
and I want to make sense out of that I

537
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,905
想要寻找这种关系
want to look for the relationship

538
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,535
高度和年龄之间我实际上
between height and age I'm actually

539
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,725
要寻找之间的线性关系
gonna look for a linear relation between

540
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,595
高度和年龄一点也好
height and age okay so first of all

541
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,415
这些是所有的地方，因此
these are all over the place so the

542
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,495
统计学家要做的第一步
first step that a statistician to does

543
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,235
是得到平均值为零得到平均值
is to get mean zero get the average to

544
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,775
为零所以这一切都是如此
be zero so what is so so all these

545
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,255
从第1行到处都是积分
points are all over the place from row 1

546
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,385
高度我减去平均值
the heights I subtract the average

547
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,715
高度所以这是我的矩阵
height so this is a the matrix I'm

548
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,775
真的要继续工作的是我的矩阵a
really going to work on is my matrix a

549
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:40,015
减去平均身高
minus the average height well in all

550
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:47,175
组件所以这是我减去的
components so this is a I'm subtracting

551
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,605
我正在减去这些平均值
I'm subtracting these a mean so average

552
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:56,005
身高是一个平均年龄哦
height an average age oh that was a

553
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:01,195
精彩的记谱法asubaaacan
brilliant notation a sub a can't be a

554
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,655
你看到矩阵做了什么
sub you see what the matrix has done

555
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,435
这个两个矩阵意味着它只是
this this matrix of two means it's just

556
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:20,865
刚刚制作的每一行现在增加了两行
just made each row of a now adds two now

557
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:26,565
如果我有一堆东​​西怎么办？
what if I have a bunch of things and

558
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,815
我减掉了他们的手段
I've subtracted off their means of the

559
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,755
平均值或平均值现在为零
mean or the average is now zero then

560
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,825
那些东西加起来就是我的权利
those things add up to zero right I'm

561
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,815
只是喜欢把这些点进入
just like brought these points into

562
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:47,115
像这里的东西，这就是年龄
something like here this is this is age

563
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:53,935
这是高度，让我们看看和通过
and this is height and let's see and by

564
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,015
减去它不再是不合理的
subtracting it no longer is unreasonable

565
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,235
有负面年龄
to have negative age

566
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:07,305
负高度，因为我是对的
negative height because I'm so right the

567
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,155
小孩子，当我减去它
little kids when I subtract it off the

568
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,435
平均年龄他们最终得到了
average age they ended up with a

569
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,675
消极的年龄，旧的老年人最终
negative age the old older ones ended up

570
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,495
仍然是积极的，不知怎的，我有一个
still positive and somehow I've got a

571
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:28,095
很多但很有希望
whole lot of points but hopefully

572
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,715
他们是他们的意思现在零你做
they're they're mean is now zero do you

573
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,395
看到我已经集中了
see that I've since I've centered the

574
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,445
零零的数据，我正在寻找
data at zero zero and I'm looking for

575
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,025
我在这里找什么呢？
what what am I looking for here I'm

576
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,635
寻找最适合我的路线
looking for the best line that's what I

577
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,735
想找到，这将是一个问题
want to find and that would be a problem

578
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,635
在PCA中，什么是最好的线性关系
in PCA what's the best linear relation

579
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,575
因为PCA是有限的PCA不是全部
because PCA is limited PCA isn't all of

580
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,455
无论如何深入学习整体
deep learning by any means the whole

581
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,845
深度学习的成功是最终的
success of deep learning was the final

582
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,155
经过一堆多年的实现
realization after a bunch of years that

583
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,065
他们必须具有非线性功能
they had to have a nonlinear function in

584
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,965
那里要去模型
there to to get to get to to model

585
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:17,145
严重的数据，但这里的PCA是线性的
serious data but here's PCA is a linear

586
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,265
生意，我正在寻找最好的
business and I'm looking for the best

587
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:27,895
你会说等一下
line and you will say wait a minute

588
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,415
我知道如何找到最好的线正好
I know how to find the best line just

589
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,755
使用这些正方形高斯做它不可能
use these squares Gauss did it can't be

590
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,215
都不好
all bad

591
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,445
但PCA和我正在给一个谈话
but PCA and and I was giving a talk in

592
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,155
纽约的时候，我只是学习
New York when I was just learning about

593
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,775
它和某人说你在做什么
it and somebody said what you're doing

594
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,695
PCA必须至少相同
with PCA has to be the same as least

595
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,785
正方形它找到了最好的线和我
squares it's finding the best line and I

596
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,875
知道不是，但我不知道怎么做
knew it wasn't but I didn't know how to

597
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,165
最好回答这个问题，现在回答
answer the question best and now at

598
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,095
至少我知道更好，所以最好的线路
least I know better so the best line in

599
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,495
最小二乘法可我提醒你
least squares can I remind you about

600
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,505
这些方块因为这并非最不重要
these squares because this is not least

601
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,435
方这些广场的最佳路线等等
square the best line of these squares so

602
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,265
我有一天
I have some day

603
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,415
积分，我有一个最好的路线
points and I have a best line that goes

604
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,355
通过它们和这些方块我
through them and and these squares I

605
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,685
并不总是将数据置于中心位置
don't always Center the data to mean

606
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,955
零，但我可以，但是做什么
zero but I could but what what what do

607
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,225
你在这些方格中最小化
you minimize in these squares least

608
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:36,195
如果你还记得那张照片中的方块
square if you remember the picture in

609
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,585
最小二乘的线性代数书
linear algebra books of least squares

610
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,315
你测量三个错误
you measure the errors like the three

611
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,695
错误，这是你错了多少
errors and it's how much you're wrong at

612
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:53,805
这三个点的是三个
those three points those are the three

613
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,315
错误
errors

614
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,595
一个X和B中的B之间的差异
a difference between a X and B the B

615
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:05,925
减去X你方，你加起来
minus a X that you square and you add up

616
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,005
这三个错误和有什么不同
those three errors and what's different

617
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,215
在这里，我的意思是有更多的积分，但
over here I mean there's more points but

618
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,885
那不是那个不重要的
that's not that's not the point that's

619
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,085
没有区别的区别是在
not the difference the difference is in

620
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,445
您正在垂直测量的PCA
PCA you're measuring perpendicular to

621
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,985
这条线你要加起来所有这些
the line you're adding up all these

622
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,885
小家伙正在盯着他们，所以你
little guys squaring them so you're

623
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,705
加上他们的方块并尽量减少
adding up their squares and minimizing

624
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,315
所以你看到的点是不同的
so the points you see it's a different

625
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,345
问题因此它有所不同
problem and therefore it has a different

626
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,845
回答这个，这个答案结果是
answer that and this answer turns out to

627
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:54,705
涉及到这个答案的SVDsigmaz
involve the SVD sigmaz where this answer

628
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,475
你记得从普通的线性
you remember from ordinary linear

629
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,065
代数只是当你减少你
algebra just when you minimize that you

630
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,635
得到了线索导致的等式
got to an equation the leads leads to

631
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,905
最佳X的一个等式也是如此
one equation for the best X so do you

632
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,285
记住是的，现在是什么
remember yeah what's what is it now

633
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,825
每个人都应该知道耶以及我的意思
everybody should know yeah well I mean

634
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,735
我们实际上会在这看到它
and we will actually see it in this

635
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,435
当然因为我们正在做的一部分
course because we're doing the part of

636
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,685
线性代数在这里我们还没有做到
linear algebra here we haven't done it

637
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,535
然而，再次告诉我什么是伙伴
yet though and tell me again what mate

638
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,245
Maitre是什么等式做的
what Maitre what equation do

639
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,325
我自己或那个问题a
myself or the for that problem a

640
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:39,845
转置X等于转置B
transpose a X had equal a transpose B

641
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:49,425
称为正规方程式的一部分
called the normal equations part of it

642
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:55,245
说这是在回归
says this is a regression in in

643
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,435
统计语言是一种回归
statistics language that's a regression

644
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,765
问题这是一个不同的问题好吧
problem this is a different problem okay

645
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:06,015
现在就这样，这涉及到他们
just so now so that involves well they

646
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,475
两者都涉及转置这种类型
both involve a transpose a that's sort

647
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,815
有趣的是因为你有一个
of interesting because you have a

648
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,455
矩形矩阵a然后更早或
rectangular matrix a and then sooner or

649
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,955
后来一个转置即将到来但是这个
later a transpose a is coming but this

650
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,445
涉及解决的线性系统
involves solving a linear system of

651
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,165
方程，速度非常快，我们将做到这一点
equations so it's fast and we will do it

652
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,395
这很可能是非常重要的
and it's very important it's probably

653
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,825
1806年最重要的应用
the most important application in 1806

654
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,045
但它是不一样的，因为这一个，这样
but it's not the same as this one so

655
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,865
这是目前在1806年也许是最后一天
this is now in 1806 maybe the last day

656
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,415
是PCA，所以我没有把这些信件
is PCA so I didn't put those letters

657
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:56,745
主成分分析PCA
principle component analysis PCA which

658
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,935
他汀类药物已经做了很长时间了
statins have been doing for a long time

659
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,155
这是我们没有做一些全新的
it's we're not doing something brand new

660
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:09,615
在这里，但结果是，我们因此如何
here but the result is that we so how

661
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,505
统计学家是否考虑过这一点
does the statistician think about this

662
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:17,865
问题或数据矩阵，如果你
problem or that data matrix what if you

663
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,675
有两行数据中的两个的矩阵
have a matrix of data two by two rows

664
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,365
和许多列这么多的样本
and many columns so many many samples

665
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,325
什么，我们所做的均值为0，这样的
what and we've made the mean 0 so that's

666
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,605
第一步统计学家拍摄静止
the first step a statistician take still

667
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,285
检查平均值下一步是什么
check on the mean what's the next step

668
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,955
统计学家还做了什么呢
what else does a statistician do with

669
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,495
用来衡量叹息的数据
data to measure how fit sighs there's

670
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,235
另一个号码有一个数字，
another number there's a number that

671
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,975
与均值一致，这是方差
goes with the mean and it's the variance

672
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,805
不知何故，均值和方差
the mean and the variance so somehow

673
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,255
我们要做差异，它会
we're going to do variances and it will

674
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,005
真的参与其中因为我们有两个
really be involved because we have two

675
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:03,375
数据集高度和年龄我们是
sets of data Heights and ages we're

676
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,385
真的会有协方差
really going to have the covariance

677
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:18,125
协方差矩阵，它将是2乘2
covariance matrix and it will be 2 by 2

678
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,715
因为它不仅会告诉我们
cause it will tell us not only the

679
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,785
高度的变化就是什么
variance in the heights that's what

680
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,095
统计学家会想到的第一件事
first thing a statistician would think

681
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,555
关于你了解一些小人物
about you know some small people some

682
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,215
大人物和年龄的变化但是
big people and variation in ages but

683
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,045
也是他们之间的联系
also the link between them

684
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:38,565
高度年龄对如何做
how are the height age pairs does does

685
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,025
更多的高度更多的年龄与更多
more height does more age go with more

686
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,705
高度，当然，它确实是这样的
height and of course it does that's the

687
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,765
整点这里，所以它的这个协方差
whole point here so it's this covariance

688
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,795
矩阵和协方差矩阵或
matrix and that covariance matrix or the

689
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,035
样本协方差矩阵给它一个
sample covariance matrix to give it a

690
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,245
全名是什么，所以只是触及
full name what's the so just touching on

691
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,985
这里有统计数据
statistics for a moment here

692
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,325
什么时候我们看到这个词
what's the when do we see that word

693
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,315
在名称中的样本是什么
sample in the in the name what is that

694
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,915
告诉我们它告诉我们这个
telling us it's telling us that this

695
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,115
矩阵是从样本中计算出来的
matrix is computed from the samples not

696
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,055
从理论概率
from a theoretical probability

697
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,765
分配我们可能有一个建议
distribution we might have a proposed

698
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,685
该高度遵循分布
distribution that the height follows the

699
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,565
高龄跟随年龄的年龄
a the age while height follows the age

700
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:31,205
通过一些公式，这将给我们一个
by some formula and that would give us a

701
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,655
理论上的差异我们正在做样本
theoretical variances we're doing sample

702
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,005
差异也称为经验
variances also called empirical

703
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,595
经验所说的协方差
covariance made empirical says

704
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,935
经验，这个词意味着从
empirical that word means from the

705
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,365
从数据信息，所以这就是
information from the data so that's what

706
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,895
我们这样做，它正是一列火车
we do and it is exactly a train a

707
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:58,844
aatranspose你必须将它标准化
a a transpose you have to normalize it

708
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:06,015
通过数据点的数量和
by the number of data points and and

709
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,005
然后出于某种原因最为人所知
then for some reason best known to

710
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:18,135
统计学家，它是n减1和
statisticians it's n minus 1 and of

711
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,935
当然，他们一定是正确的，他们已经
course they got to be right they've been

712
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,965
很长一段时间，它应该是n
around a long time and it should be n

713
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,625
减1，因为不知何故一度
minus 1 because somehow one degree of

714
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,564
我们采取了自由
freedom was accounted for when we took

715
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:33,995
拿走了那个平均为0的人
took away the one who made the mean 0

716
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,415
无论如何没有问题，但N减1
anyway no problem but but the N minus 1

717
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,385
不会影响我们的计算
is not going to affect our computation

718
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,895
在这里，这是告诉的矩阵
here that this is the matrix that tells

719
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,505
我们这就是我们，这就是我们所
us that's what we were that's what we've

720
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,524
得到了我们所拥有的
got to work with that's what we've got

721
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:53,975
使用矩阵aa转置
to work with the matrix a a transpose

722
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:00,344
然后我们就有这个问题所以我们
and then so we have this problem so we

723
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:03,104
有一个是的，我想我们真的有一个
have a yeah I guess we really have a

724
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:07,574
我们想找到的最小问题是的
minimum problem we want to find yeah

725
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:13,544
哪些问题是我们解决所以我们
what problem are we solving so our

726
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:18,614
问题不仅仅是广场不是没有
problem was not least squares not not

727
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:22,304
与这些方块相同，但是
the same as these squares similar but

728
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:25,245
不一样，我们想尽量减少
not the same we want to minimize so

729
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,745
我们正在寻找最好的路线
we're looking for that best line

730
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:35,235
我们的年龄等于C倍数
we're age equals some number C times the

731
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,185
高度时间ya或高度也许它会
height times ya or height maybe it would

732
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,715
把年龄放在这里更好
have been better to put age here and

733
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,344
高度在这里不，不，我们是因为他们是两个
height here no no we're cuz they're two

734
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:47,594
未知因此我正在寻找C我
unknowns so I'm looking for C I'm

735
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,344
寻找C号寻找
looking for the number C looking for the

736
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:54,915
C号，只有两分钟
number C and with just two minutes in

737
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,774
上课留下了那个数字C会是什么
class left what is that number C gonna

738
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:02,415
当我最终得到问题时
be when I finally get the problem stated

739
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,975
正确
properly

740
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,364
然后解决它，我要学习的是
and then solve it I'm gonna learn that

741
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:12,854
年龄与身高的最佳比例是西格玛
the best ratio of age to height is Sigma

742
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:17,475
1西格玛1，这就是那个
1 Sigma 1 that's so that's the one that

743
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,854
告诉我们这两者是如何联系的
tells us how those two are connected and

744
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:25,985
正交和什么是最好的
the orthogonal and what will be the best

745
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,985
是的，不，也许我没有回答
yeah well no maybe I didn't answer that

746
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:36,405
太对了，因为我在找我
too right because I'm looking for I'm

747
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,985
寻找指向的向量
looking for the vector that points in

748
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:45,255
正确的方式是啊，我很抱歉，我想
the right way yeah I'm sorry I think the

749
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,505
答案是它一定是那里的
answer is it's got to be there in the

750
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,475
SPD我认为这是你想要的矢量
SPD I think it's the vector you want

751
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,705
它是uu1的主要组成部分
it's a principal component uu 1 let's do

752
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,935
星期五，我希望你看到
that properly on Friday I hope you see

753
