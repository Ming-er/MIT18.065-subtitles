好吧，让我重新开始
okay let me start again

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,144
感谢Rao教授的帮助
thanks for helping with Professor Rao

11
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:32,054
并在最后两个实验室工作
and working on the labs the last two

12
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:36,075
次我说实验室真的
times I was saying the labs were really

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,195
为他的班级，这是90分钟
for his class which is 90 minutes so

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,295
我们有点没时间了
that we were kind of running out of time

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,525
只是回答你所知道的那些问题
just answering those questions you know

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,225
让系统说OK继续下去
getting the system to say ok keep going

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:54,315
无论如何，他会发展那些和我
anyway he's going to develop those and I

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,745
认为这样会有好事
think there'll be a good thing so

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,725
实际上我和第二个实验室一样
actually the second lab I was as I was

20
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,054
看着它我在想数学
watching it I I was thinking of a math

21
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,385
问题，我可以就此向您汇报
question and may I report to you on that

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,025
数学问题所以记得实验室是
math question so remember the lab was

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,544
完成矩阵你有一些
completing a matrix you've got some

24
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,575
条目，你可以放入任何其他
entries and you can put in any other

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,625
在其他位置和条目
entries in the other positions and the

26
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,665
问题是，你能完成它的
question was can you complete it to a

27
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,825
排名一个矩阵，所以这里是什么
rank one matrix and so what was here's

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,455
我的问题是什么立场是好的
my question what positions are ok and

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,035
你可能不会是什么位置
what positions could you maybe not be

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,715
能够完成一级矩阵
able to complete to a rank one matrix

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,335
例子是最好的所以我是
examples are the best okay so so I'm

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,285
看这个问题，好吧
looking at this question here ok so

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,125
假设我正在寻找排名第一
suppose I I'm looking for a rank one

34
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,315
X列y转置形式的矩阵
matrix of the form X column y transpose

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,845
或UV转置我想我们就是那些
or UV transpose I guess we're those are

36
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,034
我们用来进行UV转置的字母
the letters we're used to UV transpose

37
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,725
这当然意味着每个IJ
and that means of course that a IJ each

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,015
一个IJ
a IJ

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:24,315
是UI时间VJ正确所以我们得到了我们
is UI times VJ right so we've got we're

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:33,255
能够选择我们有M使用让我问
able to choose we have M used let me ask

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,705
我可以提出一个问题，让我来吧
a question could I complete so let me

42
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,745
取m等于n等于3所以3乘3矩阵
take m equal n equals 3 so 3 by 3 matrix

43
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,705
我会给你我的罪减1
I'm gonna give you my sin minus 1 which

44
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:55,905
是3加3减去15个职位和
is 3 plus 3 minus 1 5 positions and

45
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:04,625
假设I+4并给出一些非零值
suppose I + 4 and give some non zeros in

46
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,725
其中5个职位
which 5 positions

47
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,745
所以Y是数字M加n的地方
so Y is where is that number M plus n

48
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,285
因为我有，所以减去1来
minus 1 coming from well because I have

49
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,905
m使用，我有羡慕对于等级1
M use and I have envies for for Rank 1

50
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,465
矩阵我从1变为MJ从1变为1
matrix I goes from 1 to M J goes from 1

51
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,995
到N所以我有M+n，但显然有
to N so I have M + n but obviously there

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,105
我可以让我可以要求
I could I could make I could require the

53
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,775
首先你是一个1，换句话说
first you to be a 1 in other words when

54
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,145
我将那些乘以一度
I'm multiplying those there's one degree

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,375
那种重复的自由
of freedom that that is sort of repeated

56
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,725
在这里，因为如果我只是给你
here because if I'm just given you if

57
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,045
无论如何，我只是给你一个
I'm just give just in the one anyway you

58
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,415
看到我可以重新调整使用量
see it that that I can rescale the use

59
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,675
所以第一个u是1和那个
so that the first u is a 1 and and that

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,915
离开我M+n-1所以我可以给你
leaves me M + n - 1 so could I give you

61
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,215
这五个数字也可以
these five numbers and could you

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,595
完成到一级矩阵所以
complete that to a rank one matrix so

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,815
那些是非零的，为什么我说没有
those are non zeros why do I say none

64
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,895
零，因为如果那个号码发生了
zeros because if that number happened to

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,224
是零，我有坏
be a zero I'd have bad

66
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,474
如果我开了一个和我
if I prescribed that one and I

67
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,214
规定它为零然后如果每个
prescribed it to be zero then if every

68
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,894
列必须是其中的倍数
column has to be a multiple of that

69
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,295
列这些都必须为零
column these would all have to be zero

70
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,164
所以我不希望我能够
so I don't want that I want to be able

71
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,485
因此，规定五个数字
to prescribe five numbers and therefore

72
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,094
他们最好不要零也好
they better better not be zero okay

73
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,594
你能完成那份工作吗？
could you complete the job with that

74
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:01,384
我认为你可以选择五个职位
choice of of five positions I think you

75
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,844
可能因为你会如何决定
could because how would you decide on

76
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,134
这个数字我至少是一种方式
that number well I'm at least one way to

77
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,015
看看它是什么数字
look at it is what would that number be

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,144
那就是这个号码
there so this is that number would be

79
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,954
选择那里只有一个选择
chosen there be one and only one choice

80
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,075
因为这将给予排名第一
for that that would give rank one in

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,834
事实上，2比2的决定因素
fact that little 2 by 2 determinant

82
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:32,735
必须是0好写所有
would have to be 0 well write the all

83
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,864
所有列都应该是行
the rows all the columns are supposed to

84
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:38,164
是所有行的一列的倍数
be multiples of one column all the rows

85
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:40,054
应该是一行的倍数
are supposed to be multiples of one row

86
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:45,964
所有这两个人都是我们的等级1
all the two by twos are our rank 1

87
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,454
他们都是2并且排名第2
they're all and rank 1 for a 2 by 2

88
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:52,175
意味着决定因素0所以我会知道什么
means determinant 0 so I would know what

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,605
一个必须是数字将
that one had to be that number would

90
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:01,864
必须是1121211
have to be a 1 2 times a 2 1 over a 1 1

91
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:08,944
那是因为我必须得到每2个
that's because I have to get a every 2

92
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,314
如果我，那么2个行列式必须为0
by 2 determinant has to be 0 here if I

93
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,074
想要排名1我不能忍受任何两个
want Rank 1 I can't stand any two by

94
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,194
两个是可逆的
twos that are that are invertible

95
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,795
矩阵因此所有决定因素都必须如此
matrices so all the determinants have to

96
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,425
是0
be 0

97
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,814
好的，当然还有这3个数字
ok and of course then these 3 numbers

98
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,894
我会允许我填写那3个
would allow me to fill in there those 3

99
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,574
数字将允许我填补
numbers would allow me to fill that

100
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:33,514
我可以填写那3个数字
those 3 numbers well I may fill that

101
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,464
它很容易，所以我可以看到
it'd be easy easy so that I can see that

102
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:41,365
这些是有效的5个职位
those are 5 positions that work

103
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,225
现在给我五个不会的职位
now give me five positions that won't

104
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,515
工作所以这很好，现在检查我
work so this is good this is check now I

105
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,505
想要一个我无法工作的地方
want one that where I can't make it work

106
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,725
所以让我给那个数字，这个数字
so let me give that number that number

107
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,695
好吧好吧我正在寻找一些东西
okay well so I'm looking for something

108
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,725
失败的一组职位失败了
that fails a set of positions that fails

109
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,875
然后我想能够测试吗
and then I want to be able to test does

110
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,785
这组职位适合任何非
the set of positions work for any non

111
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,825
零或它不能正常工作所以我想要
zeros or does it not work okay so I want

112
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,925
互相了解我在寻找什么
to get one another what am I looking for

113
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,305
这是另一个有效的
here another a different one that works

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,855
好吧那么还有什么可以分开的
okay so what else would work apart from

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,395
让我们看看我想我接受那一个
that let's see I suppose I take that one

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,595
那我在那个位置怎么样？
now what about that position there I

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,935
不能选择一个合适的，我必须
must not choose that one right I must

118
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,785
不要选择那个，因为那会
not choose that one because that would

119
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,275
完成两个两个，如果我给了
complete a two by two and if if I gave

120
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,465
错误的数字是决定因素
the wrong numbers the determinant

121
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,235
不会是零，我会失败
wouldn't be zero and I would be failed

122
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,605
所以我不能给我那个位置
so I must not give that position maybe I

123
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,915
也许我可以给那个位置
could give that position maybe I could

124
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,505
如果我有这些，那么给这个怎么样
give this one how's that if I had those

125
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,025
五，我能完成它
five would I be able to complete it

126
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,325
看起来不错，反正它看起来好让的
looks good anyway it looks good let's

127
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,955
看看我将如何完成它
see how would I go about completing that

128
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,055
让我们看看我能不知道那是什么
let's see I could I would know what that

129
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,565
数字必须来自这两个两个
number had to be from this two by two

130
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,305
从这两个两个我想知道
from this two by two I would know that

131
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,555
这先生的数字现在这个和
number from this sir where now this and

132
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,485
这个和现在这不是什么好事
this and this now that's not any good

133
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,355
我现在该怎么办才能得到如何
what do I do now to get how would I get

134
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,345
这个号码
this number

135
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:33,335
哦好吧我想我必须这样才能搞定
oh okay I guess I have to use so to get

136
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,724
这将完成那个或两个
this would complete that or this two by

137
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,675
两个哦是的没关系没问题
two oh yeah okay no problem

138
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,065
永远不会完成那个权利
that would never complete that one right

139
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,155
但是这个我不认为我能得到
but this one I don't think I can get

140
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,505
我马上就知道了
immediately but I can get it once I know

141
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,325
这些显然我可以得到那个我
these then obviously I can get that I

142
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,875
可以做到这一点，所以我必须
can get that right so I have to

143
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,394
这是一种很好的组合
it's a sort of nice combinatorial

144
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,845
五个职位的问题
problem which which five positions will

145
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,694
工作哪五个五个不行
work which five which five will not work

146
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:08,314
我怎么说，或者当然是这样的
how do I tell so or of course that's for

147
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:14,915
3x3是的，所以让我有一个更大的
3x3 yeah so let me I had a like a bigger

148
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,454
让我让我升级到4x4
example let me let me move up to 4x4 so

149
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:22,954
所以现在这里有我的想法
so now here's here comes the idea that I

150
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,045
昨晚从数学教授那里学到的
learned last night from a math professor

151
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,685
谁做组合s--所以这些
who does combinatoric s-- so these

152
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,925
做他们认识的组合学的人
people who do combinatorics they've know

153
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,215
我们其他人没有的东西
stuff that the rest of us don't

154
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,074
好的，所以这是他的观点
okay so here's the his his view is to

155
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,584
采取有这些将是行一二
take have these would be rows one two

156
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,305
三，我可能会添加另一行让我
three I may I may add another row let me

157
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,774
做一个4x4和这些将是一个列
do a 4x4 and these would be columns one

158
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,024
二三四
two three four

159
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:59,495
好吧，现在我正在寻找七个如此
okay now I'm looking for seven so so if

160
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,555
我订了一个条目，我会把它放在边缘
I prescribed an entry I'll put in a edge

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,975
他们之间让我让我炒作炒作
between them so let me let me hype hype

162
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,944
这个最多4x4是啊是的，这是一个很好的
this one up to 4x4 yeah yeah it's a good

163
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:16,134
其实我只是画这幅画
one actually I'll just draw this picture

164
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,355
所以假设我开了一个哦
so suppose I prescribed the one one oh

165
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,605
是的，在这里，我会告诉你什么
yeah and over here I'll show you what

166
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,215
我这样做是为了让我加入一个
I've done so that I'm putting in the one

167
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,774
一个位置我正在寻找七个权利
one position I'm looking for seven right

168
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,295
四加四减一七数
four plus four minus one seven numbers

169
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,345
好的
okay

170
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,884
然后我会把这个放在第二行
then I'll put in this is Row two column

171
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,764
一排两列的一个，这将是
one row two column one that would be

172
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,954
那时我会把两到四个放进去
there then I'll put in a two to four so

173
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:49,264
那将是第二排第四列
that would be Row two column four then

174
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,105
我会在3到4，这样
I'll put in a three to four so that

175
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,884
将是第3行第4列，最后我会
would be Row 3 column 4 and finally I'll

176
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:03,035
让我们看看我做了多少
put in let's see so how many have I done

177
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,045
一两三四我必须得到
one two three four and I've got to get

178
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,795
多达七个规定7
up to seven prescribe seven

179
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,155
好吧，让我，我的意思是我会放脚
well let me I mean I'll put a foot

180
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,855
Mauryan还好，我给了第四排
Mauryan okay so so on row four I gave

181
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,644
两个三个和四个我输入了这个
two three and four and did I put in this

182
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:33,694
一个是的我做得很好所以我现在
one yes I did okay well so I've now

183
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:38,394
我可以订七七个号码
prescribed seven seven numbers could I

184
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,954
完成矩阵以对一个矩阵进行排名
complete the matrix to rank one matrix

185
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,564
你是怎么看待数学问题的
how you see the math question if I'm

186
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:49,984
在那里我有7个职位
given seven positions there I can this

187
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,634
是另一种看待同样的方式
is another way to look at the same

188
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,324
图片这是我放在一边的
picture this is I put in an edge for

189
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:58,804
每一个X所以，如果我有七个X，我就得到了
every X so if I have seven X's I've got

190
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,304
七个边缘，这称为a
seven edges and and this is called a

191
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:07,204
二分图所以它是我得到的图
bipartite graph so it's a graph I've got

192
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,845
四个节点这里有四个节点，所以我
four nodes here four nodes here so I

193
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,004
有八个节点
have eight nodes

194
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,855
它是一个二分图，因为它
it's a bipartite graph because the the

195
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,165
节点我有超过节点的一部分
nodes I have one part of nodes over

196
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,134
这里有一部分节点是二分的
there one part of nodes here bipartite

197
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,494
意思是两个部分，所以行给我一个
means two parts so the rows give me one

198
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:26,884
列给我的部分边缘
part of the edges the columns give me

199
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,074
边缘的另一部分和所有
the other part of the edges and all the

200
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,855
在我不是的部分之间进行连接
connections go between the parts I'm not

201
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,535
我没有从行中的任意行
I don't have any lines from from a row

202
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,764
因为所有的代码都是
to a row because all the whole code is

203
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:47,044
这告诉我那些在哪里
that this tells me what where those

204
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:51,244
七个职位现在好，我只是
seven positions are okay now I'm just

205
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:54,244
要问你我可以完成
going to ask you can I complete the

206
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:58,624
我可以完成矩阵图
graph can I complete the matrix can I

207
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:04,444
完整的秩一个矩阵有什么好
complete rank one matrix there okay what

208
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,595
你是否认为如此真实
do you think so the and the real

209
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,684
问题是什么是什么规则
question is what's the rule what what

210
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,184
什么是我什么时候能不能看到的
what's the how can I see when I can't

211
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:17,374
完成矩阵得到的东西在
complete the matrix something gets in

212
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,924
这里的道路是神在路上的样子
the way here what God in the way was

213
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,275
这个2x2
this 2x2

214
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,965
实际上我问过这个问题
and actually I asked the question on

215
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,175
电子邮件是我可以随时完成它
email is it can I always complete it

216
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:29,595
是啊
yeah

217
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,215
所以，让我这就是我的问题
so let me that would be the question I

218
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,885
可以问你我可以随时完成
could ask you can I always complete the

219
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,875
图你完成矩阵有
graph you complete the matrix to have

220
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,705
当我没有遇到时排名第1
Rank 1 when there when I don't run into

221
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,565
这就是我要避免的一切
this is that all I have to avoid a

222
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,355
两个两个我在哪里给了三个
two-by-two where I've given three where

223
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,305
我给了所有四个参赛作品，所以是的
I'm given all four entries so yeah here

224
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,775
这个II能够如此完成
this I I was able to complete yeah so so

225
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,925
抱歉，如果我得到了，我们就做一个
sorry duh let's do one if I if I'm given

226
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:07,955
那些条目，也许还有其他一些我
those entries and maybe some others I

227
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,465
总共猜七是失败了
guess seven altogether that's a failure

228
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,305
对我，如果我不能处方任何非
right I if I can't prescribe any non

229
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,735
因为这七个职位的零
zeros in those seven positions because

230
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,735
如果我可能会开出任何非零值
if I prescribe any non zeros I probably

231
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,085
我不会有零决定因素
won't have a zero determinant here I

232
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,265
不会对该列排名第一
won't have rank one that that column

233
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,275
将不会是那个的倍数
will be will not be a multiple of that

234
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,095
无论我在这里做什么，我都搞砸了
column whatever I do here I've screwed

235
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:42,075
已经这样就失败了
up already so that's a fail okay right

236
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,105
我该如何让我拍摄这张照片
and how do I let me take that picture

237
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,745
然后把它变成这张照片
and and turn it into this picture

238
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,665
所以行列，所以如果我采取这七个
so rows columns so if I take these seven

239
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:58,035
那是第1排1234所以第1排去了
that's Row 1 Row 1 2 3 4 so Row 1 goes

240
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:04,035
到1和2行2到1和2行3
to 1 and 2 Row 2 goes to 1 and 2 Row 3

241
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:12,425
转到4，第4行转到3和4
goes to 4 and Row 4 goes to 3 and 4

242
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,305
这是一个失败，我怎么知道它
that's a failure and how do I know it's

243
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,725
一个失败我想现在拿出来
a failure I want to now come up with the

244
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,475
答案拿出答案，如果我
answer come up with the answer so if I

245
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,075
给任何7个职位或任何M加n
give any 7 positions or any M plus n

246
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,675
减去我可以创造的1个位置
minus 1 positions like that I can create

247
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,155
像这样的图只是跟随
a graph like that just following the

248
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,084
你看到那些的规则
rule that you saw those

249
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,134
七个位置给了我七个优势
seven positions gave me seven edges in

250
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,744
我的图表，它是一个二分图
my graph and it's a bipartite graph

251
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:45,504
因为每个边缘都来自这个部分
because every edge goes from this part

252
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:50,064
到这一部分，这是一个失败
over to this part and that's a failure

253
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:54,504
它失败的原因是
and the reason it's a failure is the

254
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:58,314
我失败的原因是我有
reason it's a failure is that I have

255
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,485
这是一个循环，如果我穿过对面
here a cycle if I go across down across

256
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,675
我回来了，我开始了
down I come back where I started that

257
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:15,925
将是一个循环等于失败大
would be a cycle equals failure big

258
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,295
每个人都看到我不能给这四个
everybody sees I can't give these four

259
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,394
数字一般我都要马宁
numbers generally I would have to manin

260
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,285
你们三个我没有任何自由
you three I don't have any freedom left

261
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,944
那第四个和看的方式
where that fourth one and the way to see

262
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:32,485
在这张照片中就是那样的
that in this picture is that that's that

263
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,434
这是一个循环，所以这里是
there's a cycle so here's the

264
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:39,674
教授那个组合的东西
combinatoric thing that that Professor

265
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,405
波斯纳COFF告诉我昨晚你
Posner COFF told me about last night you

266
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,254
如果和，可以完成一级矩阵
can complete to a rank one matrix if and

267
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,924
只有在没有循环的情况下才是这样的
only if no cycles so that was a that was

268
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:58,105
这是我刚刚回答的问题
a that's a just answered my question

269
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,884
完美
perfectly

270
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:02,054
这个是我可以完成的一个
this one is one where I can complete and

271
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,584
它有一个循环周期意味着你来了
it's got a cycle cycle meaning you come

272
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,304
回到你开始的地方，但是我
back to where you started but so I I

273
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:14,215
想到也许这样我对他的问题
thought maybe so my question to him

274
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,495
你可以随时完成它
which was was can you always complete it

275
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,215
如果在途中没有两个两个
if there are no two by twos in the way

276
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,804
他的回答告诉我，也许是
and his answers told me that maybe the

277
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:30,085
两个两个可以没关系但是那里
two by twos could be okay but there

278
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,635
可能是一个更长周期的更大周期
could be a bigger cycle a longer cycle

279
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,515
那会搞砸你让我闭上
that would screw you up so let me close

280
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,685
与那种类型的例子
with with an example of that sort

281
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,445
所以这将再次失败
so this is going to be fail again

282
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,654
但是没有2x2在其他方面负责
but but no 2x2 is responsible in other

283
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:56,585
言语它会失败我将无法做到
words it's gonna fail I won't be able to

284
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,544
完成此矩阵即使如此有
complete this matrix even so there

285
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,115
是不是任何完成的两个由两个2乘
aren't any completed two by twos a 2 by

286
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,054
a2by2我立即知道失败了
a 2 by 2 I knew immediately was failure

287
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,495
所以，让我看看我能做到这一点没关系
so let me see if I can do that okay okay

288
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,515
所以这是一个失败的行12这是行
so here's a failure Row 1 2 this is rows

289
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,024
1234这是列1234和
1 2 3 4 and this is columns 1 2 3 4 and

290
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:25,595
我想我会在那里得到一个
I think I'm gonna have a 1 given there

291
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,105
是的我以前开始这样做了
and yeah I sort of started this before

292
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:42,695
2到1和4＆3到4和4
and 2 goes to 1 & 4 & 3 goes to 4 and 4

293
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:50,345
去那个安全的赌注现在我好了
goes to that safe bet okay now I've only

294
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,845
投入245我允许7但我
put in 2 4 5 and I'm allowed 7 but I

295
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,774
想我已经在这里出事所以让
think I'm already in trouble here so let

296
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,685
我让我得出这样的照片在这个如此
me let me draw this picture for this so

297
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,705
这是行1234，这是列
this is rows 1 2 3 4 and this is columns

298
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,644
1234现在我怎么办？
1 2 3 4 and now what if I I've

299
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:18,215
规定一个我知道的
prescribed that one I know that goes

300
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,394
从哦，我忘记了正确的方法
from oh my forgotten the right way to do

301
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:27,185
照片我的bybite我的二分
the picture my by.bite my bipartite

302
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,904
图不是应该如此
graph wasn't what it should have been so

303
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:37,774
1234现在我好了
that 1 2 3 4 okay now I'm going to do

304
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:40,804
的二分图图像即
the the bipartite graph picture that

305
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:47,274
跟这张照片一样1211221
goes with this picture so 1 2 1 1 2 2 1

306
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,925
224我要做什么
2 2 4 what I'm gonna do

307
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,655
我只想说一下我要做的事情
let me just say what I'm gonna do I'm

308
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,465
在这里创造一个长度的循环
gonna create a cycle over here of length

309
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,785
6长度为4的循环是我得到的
6 a cycle of length 4 is what I got from

310
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:09,905
一个2乘2乘2乘2给我一个
a 2 by 2 by 2 by 2 that took me 1 one

311
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,065
回来的另一个回来
way back another back another back

312
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,375
另一个我完成了一个循环，我回来了
another I completed a cycle I came back

313
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,515
到我开始的地方
to where I started

314
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,995
现在我想要一个只有四条边
with just four edges now I want a

315
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,685
用6完成一个完整的循环
complete one complete a cycle with 6

316
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,775
边缘，以便让我，让我把它收回去了
edges so let me let me draw it in the

317
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,815
那么现在我要放了
picture here then now I'm going to put

318
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,805
一个边缘从四个回到一个所以11
an edge from four back to one so so 1 1

319
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:45,695
21124221224如果我有任何东西
2 1 1 2 4 2 2 1 2 2 4 if I got any yeah

320
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,885
我想12
I think 1 2

321
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,315
该死的我不想要一个短暂的周期
goddamn I didn't want a short cycle I

322
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,655
如果你想要一个更大更长的周期让我
want a bigger longer cycle let me if you

323
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,675
让我得到这样的事情，所以224是
let me get the darn thing so 2 2 4 is

324
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,315
不是我想要的所以我在这里开始一个循环
not what I want so I here start a cycle

325
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,425
OK去的地方回头去的地方去
ok go somewhere go back go somewhere go

326
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,755
回到某个地方回去吧我
back go somewhere go back now there I

327
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,685
得到它长度6长度6所以现在让我
got it length 6 length 6 so now let me

328
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,205
把X放在他们现在属于的地方
put the X's in where they belong now so

329
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,395
一个连接到一个和四个
one is connected to one and four that's

330
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:27,785
右2连接到2和43不连接
right 2 is connected to 2 and 4 3 is not

331
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,615
连接到任何人让我们放
connected to anybody let's let's put

332
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,755
一个在和4被连接到1和
that one in and 4 is connected to 1 and

333
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,935
24连接到1和2
2 4 is connected to 1 & 2

334
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,245
好吧，我相信这个我相信那张照片
ok I believe this I believe that picture

335
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,385
现在我的主张就是这张照片
goes with that picture now my claim is

336
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,365
那里没有没有2
that there are no there there's no 2 by

337
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,875
2在这里立即显示我
2 in here that shows me immediately

338
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,485
失败但我会失败我无法生存
failure but I will fail I can't live

339
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,205
接着就，随即
with that

340
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,305
那些看起来像8的人
with those that looks like 8

341
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:11,145
抱歉，我只想要七个，所以我
sorry I've got I only want seven so I

342
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:18,765
我应该对不起三四
just shall I just take sorry three four

343
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,625
而且不应该有正确的好吗
and that shouldn't be there right okay

344
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,875
谢谢
thanks

345
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,845
好吧，你看，我不是一个组合
all right you see I'm not a combinatoric

346
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,145
人，但它是如此美丽有
person but it's so beautiful to have the

347
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,595
灵感将图片转换为
inspiration to convert that picture to

348
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,715
这张照片然后意识到了
this picture and then realize that a

349
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,435
这张照片中的问题是一个循环
problem in this picture is a cycle in

350
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,435
这张照片就是整个信息
this picture that's the whole message

351
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,135
这就是我的时候的全部信息
that's the whole message that when I'm

352
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,915
看这里一个循环意味着我就是我
looking here a cycle means that I'm I've

353
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,785
建立在一个随机的要求
built in a requirement which random

354
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,575
非零不会满足所以你看到了
non-zeros won't satisfy so you see that

355
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:04,305
无论如何你看到周期1123456
anyway you see the cycle 1 1 2 3 4 5 6

356
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,785
是的，所以那里有一个循环
yeah yeah so there's a cycle there so

357
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:13,245
不知怎的，那些6X是我们的
somehow those 6 X's whichever they are I

358
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,575
猜不到除了23遮阳板3所以我可以
guess not all but 2 3 visor 3 so I could

359
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,725
我可以带走这一部分
take I could take away this part of the

360
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,095
图表，只有3和3和那里
graph and just have 3 and 3 and there

361
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,075
那里将是6个数字，那就是
would be 6 numbers in there and that's

362
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,105
两个男人是啊好吧我会停在那里
two men yeah ok ok I'm gonna stop there

363
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,215
正好在课程的一半但是
exactly halfway through the class but

364
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,295
好吧，我会在那里停下来
well I'm gonna stop there with a

365
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,635
我不知道的问题我不知道
question which I don't know I don't know

366
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,365
如果我敢发出另一个问题
if I dare send another question that

367
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,225
教授海报咖啡回答
professor poster coffee who answered

368
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,075
这一个完美但问题
this one perfectly but the question

369
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,985
你什么时候可以完成一个等级
would be when could you complete a rank

370
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,795
2矩阵什么位置可以你
2 matrix what what positions could you

371
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,965
填写并能够达到排名2
fill in and be able to reach rank 2 that

372
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,235
我不知道会不会有麻烦
would be trouble right I don't know

373
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,955
无论如何我们会去那里
where we would go with that but anyway

374
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,415
但这对我们来说是18或65的净值
but that's a net for us for 18 or 65

375
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,845
这是我自然而然的问题
that's the natural question when could I

376
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,595
我们排名1对我们而言非常特别
we rank 1 is super special for us and

377
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,384
等级2或等级
rank 2 or rank

378
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:21,464
是一般情况是的如此
would be the general case yeah so so

379
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:27,904
他们现在是很好的数学问题2
they're good math questions now topic 2

380
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:36,464
卷积所以第一个实验室
convolution so the first lab in the

381
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:39,604
当然正好有一个
course just happened to have a

382
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:42,284
卷积并使用该词等
convolution and use that word and so on

383
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:51,674
但我们没有，但我们没有连接
but we did not but we didn't connect

384
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,864
那个讲座所以现在我想
that with the lectures so now I'd like

385
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,504
谈论有关的卷积
to talk about convolutions which are

386
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:59,654
非常重要，他们是
extremely important and they are

387
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:03,584
在机器学习中很重要因为
important in machine learning because

388
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:11,315
他们给你一套重量
they give you a set of weights

389
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:18,284
连接它们是一种有效的方式-
connecting they're an efficient way to -

390
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,254
让我告诉你让我告诉你好
let me show you let me show you ok

391
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:31,874
所以卷积矩阵，这将是
so a convolution matrix and this will be

392
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:36,854
循环卷积配合确定和
a cyclic convolution mate ok and the

393
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:42,584
字循环的简写
word the shorthand for cyclic

394
00:25:42,589 --> 00:25:45,134
卷积矩阵是循环的，所以
convolution matrix is circulant so what

395
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:48,754
是一个循环，我们称之为Ca
is a circulant we'll call it C a

396
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:53,414
circulant有一些羽毛球对角线
circulant has some mminton diagonals

397
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,854
这就是卷积意味着矩阵的意义
that's what convolution means matrix was

398
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:01,114
卷积意味着不变
convolution means constant

399
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:11,124
沿着每个对角线
down each diagonal

400
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:18,004
和循环意味着完整的循环
and cyclic means complete circle around

401
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:27,034
再次对角线对角线圈
again the diagonals diagonals circle

402
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:34,354
身边那么让我们告诉你我的意思是这样
around so let us show you what I mean so

403
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,234
四乘四比方说，所以它有一些
four by four let's say so it has some

404
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:41,254
进入这里有一个对角线是
entry to there's one diagonal here is

405
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:46,864
另一个对角线，所以现在我不断
another diagonal so now I have constant

406
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,994
对角线，但如果它将是一个
diagonals but if it's going to be a

407
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:51,624
循环矩阵，这是最好的
circulant matrix and this is the best

408
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:55,955
世界上的矩阵族
family of matrices in the world the

409
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,654
代数对这些来说太棒了
algebra is just terrific for these

410
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,714
矩阵，这就是为什么他们是
matrices and that's why they're the

411
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:05,104
这是信号处理的核心所以
heart of signal processing so so this is

412
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:07,354
一个恒定的对角矩阵，但事实并非如此
a constant diagonal matrix but it's not

413
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,565
还有一个对角圆圈的循环器
yet a circulant that diagonal circles

414
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,094
每个人都要完成
around to put to be completed every

415
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,664
对角线有四个条目，所以让我
diagonal has four entries here so let me

416
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:22,894
拿另一个说一个然后那个
take another one say one one then that

417
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:26,315
围绕a11和这个家伙
would circle around a11 and this guy

418
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,864
可能是0，这是一个循环矩阵
could be 0 there's a circulant matrix

419
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:39,964
你明白了你的条目
you understand then what the entry you

420
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:43,834
只需要四个数字说第一个
only need four numbers say the first

421
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,634
如果您指定了，则列
column if you if you prescribed the

422
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:48,364
然后是循环矩阵的第一列
first column of a circulant matrix then

423
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,884
你已经告诉了MATLAB所有的例子
you've told MATLAB for example all all

424
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:53,164
它需要知道你是否告诉它
it needs to know if you tell it one

425
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,924
列可以获取所有其他列
column it can get all the other columns

426
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:58,834
只是通过循环移位，第一个
just by cyclic shift there's the first

427
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,334
第2列015第二列是20
column 2 0 1 5 the second column is 2 0

428
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:07,955
15向下移动通过1的下一列是
1 5 shifted down by 1 the next column is

429
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,825
再次向下移动12015和
again shifted down by 1 2 0 1 5 and the

430
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,185
最后一栏是2015所以他们都是
last column is 2 0 1 5 so they're all

431
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:21,285
循环移位后的相同列
the same columns after a cyclic shift

432
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,505
所以这里的关键矩阵真的是一个
so the key matrix in this is really a

433
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,555
循环移位矩阵称零为零
cyclic shift matrix say zero one zero

434
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,905
零零零所以它只是说一个
zero zero zero so it just says one

435
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:42,485
非零对角线然后它是循环的
nonzero diagonal and then it's cyclic

436
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:47,375
你看，实际上这个矩阵C就是我
you see that in fact this matrix C is I

437
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,825
可以从P和P产生这个矩阵C.
can produce this matrix C from P and P

438
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,735
平方是的，我可以放入什么
squared yeah can I just put in what

439
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,955
P平方节拍我会写在这里
would P squared beats I'll write it here

440
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,975
在保持我们的同时保持这一点
without keeping that while keeping our

441
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,275
关注P所以如果我将那个矩阵平方化了什么
eye on P so if I square that matrix what

442
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,175
我会得到矩阵这是一个
matrix would I get so it's this is a

443
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,285
如果我再次换一个，则换一个
shift by one if I shift by one again

444
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,745
这又是P的倍增
that's multiplying again by P so that

445
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,275
会给我P平方
would give me P squared

446
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:26,795
什么是好的，所以
what what's in the what's in the okay so

447
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,625
现在发生了什么，它转移了两个我
what happens now it's shift by two I

448
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,785
想是这样所以这将是0010这
guess so so this will be 0 0 1 0 this

449
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,015
将是0001然后我是它的循环
will be 0 0 0 1 then I'm its cyclic

450
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,075
仍然如此，我把它放在那里
still so I'm put in the ones there and

451
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:53,025
然后只需填写零，所以P
then just fill in the zero ok so P

452
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,295
平方从2开始转移
squared shift by 2 you start out with

453
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:05,945
这一个是的，是的，是的确定好的
this one yep is that right yes yes ok ok

454
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,985
是的，让我们来做吧
yeah let's just let's just make it

455
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,985
将矢量X乘以X1X2X3
multiply a vector X naught X 1 X 2 X 3

456
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:21,465
它的作用是什么呢？
what it what it does is it puts it well

457
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,895
我已经在这里用2开始编号
I've started the numbering with 2 here X

458
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,275
2X3
2 X 3

459
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,745
x0和x1因此它将它移动了两次
x0 and x1 so it shifted it by two and

460
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,765
并周期性地得到了x2x3
and cyclically so the x2 x3 that got

461
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,745
从底部移开回到了
shifted off the bottom come back to the

462
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:47,325
顶部没关系，我想先展示一下
top okay what I want to show the first

463
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,635
财产是循环的，所以我想
property is of circulant so so suppose I

464
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,865
所以矩阵中有矩阵
have matrices see in the circular so

465
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:13,695
事实上1C倍d也是圆形的，从而
fact 1 C times D is also a circular so

466
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,545
如果我乘以循环矩阵，我得到
if I multiply circulant matrices I get

467
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,485
更多的循环矩阵和身份
more circulant matrices and the identity

468
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,885
是一个循环矩阵我有一点
is a circulant matrix I have a little

469
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,195
矩阵组是最好的小组
group of matrices the best little group

470
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,455
我可以将两个矩阵相乘
of matrices there is I can multiply two

471
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,335
小伙子们，我得到另一个
guys in the group and I get another one

472
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,005
在小组中为什么CD也是一个
in the group well why is CD also a

473
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,535
循环让我们看看能不能理解为什么
circulant let's see can we see why that

474
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:44,205
事实是真的我想这是我的方式
fact is true I guess here's my way to

475
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,715
看看它是一个循环矩阵让我放
look at it a circulant matrix let me put

476
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,715
它每个都把它放在一个循环矩阵
it put it here a circulant matrix every

477
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,295
循环矩阵是Cnaught次
circulant matrix is C naught times the

478
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,025
身份循环加C1次
identity circulant plus C 1 times the

479
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,845
单班加C加倍的2倍
single shift plus C 2 times the double

480
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,405
换班加C三倍班次
shift plus C 3 times the triple shift

481
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,225
那就是放C的方法
that that's what it takes to put C

482
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,615
那些没有C1C2和C3
naught C 1 C 2 and C 3 on those

483
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,975
对角线C很明显就是上了
diagonals C naught is obviously on the

484
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,415
主对角线C1P记住P是什么
main diagonal C 1 P remember what P is

485
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,475
将Cone放在下一个对角线上
that puts C one on the next diagonal

486
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,725
然后C2P平方，当我对此
then C 2 P squared when i square this

487
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,335
我已经换了一个所以它会放
I've shifted by one more so it will put

488
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,985
C2即将死亡
C 2 on that dying

489
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,595
最后c3会进入那些
and finally c3 would go in those

490
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:53,054
因此每个循环矩阵都是一个
positions so every circulant matrix is a

491
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,915
P中的多项式在单个移位中
polynomial in P in a single shift this

492
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,695
这是一个转变的任何组合
is any combination of shifts this is a

493
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,005
单班，这是一个双重转变
single shift that's a double shift

494
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,955
这是一个零转换
that's a triple shift that's a zero

495
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,965
转移，如果我采取组合，我得到我
shift and if I take combinations i get i

496
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,735
得到一个循环矩阵所以我现在可以
get a circulant matrix so so now I can

497
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,005
看看为什么CD也是一个循环因素
see why CD is also a circulant because

498
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:26,615
这是P中的多项式，这是一个
this is a polynomial in P and this is a

499
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,935
P中的多项式和乘法时的多项式
polynomial in P and when I multiply

500
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,335
那些我在P中得到一个多项式
those together I get a polynomial in P

501
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,705
但通常如果我乘以三度
but usually if I multiply a third degree

502
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,765
多项式由我们另外三度
polynomial by us another third degree

503
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,215
多项式所以说我正在看四
polynomial so say I'm looking at four by

504
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,365
四个循环矩阵，所以这将是
four circulant matrices so this would be

505
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:58,595
多项式PNP三度三度
a polynomial P NP a third degree three

506
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,775
这将是多项式度数3
and this would be a polynomial degree 3

507
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,035
所以这会给我一个多项式
so that would give me a polynomial of

508
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,995
6级，但我不希望那样
degree 6 but I don't want that that's

509
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,174
不知怎的，我必须定义乘法
somehow I have to define multiplication

510
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,374
所以我希望这是这些程度
so that I want this to be degree these

511
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:24,154
都应该是4乘4矩阵
are all supposed to be 4 by 4 matrices

512
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,965
就像那个
just like that one

513
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,835
这是身份的两倍加上5P加
that's twice the identity plus 5 P plus

514
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,644
1P平方加0P立方并假设我
1 P squared plus 0 P cubed and suppose I

515
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:36,614
然后，我将再次得到的广场
square that then again I'm going to get

516
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:39,465
循环矩阵，我不想要它
a circulant matrix and I don't want it

517
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,884
升到7级我想让你知道我
to go up to degree 7 I want you know I

518
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:47,265
只是想在我的多项式四个学期
just want four terms in my polynomial

519
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,414
我只想要主要的对角线
I just want the main diagonal in the

520
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:53,505
接下来的三个对角线然后循环
next three diagonals and then cyclic

521
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,114
骑自行车绕完成矩阵，
cycling around completes the matrix so

522
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,395
为什么我怎么得到哈哈
why what's how do I get ha ha

523
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:11,955
如何获得学位三分
how to get degree threes that's the

524
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,265
问题就可以你刚才告诉我
question then can you just tell me the

525
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:20,685
回答所以我倍增是的让我们
answer so I'm multiplying yeah let's

526
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,105
只是做一个例子，所以我看到的不是C1
just do an example so I've seen not C 1

527
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:31,725
pc2P平方C3P立方次D.
p c 2 P squared C 3 P cubed times D

528
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,975
没有加P1P加D2P平方和
naught plus P 1 P plus D 2 P squared and

529
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,855
D3P立方因此P为P而P为4
D 3 P cubed so that's P is this P is 4

530
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:54,495
通过4轮循环好转，我正在写
by 4 circular shift okay and I'm writing

531
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,885
所述4乘4矩阵这种方式，这是本
the 4 by 4 matrix that way this is this

532
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:03,015
应该是当然的身份好了，
should be the identity of course okay so

533
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,354
当我繁衍那些家伙为什么我不这样做
when I multiply those guys why do I not

534
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,625
拿到学位6，为什么我这是为什么
get degree 6 why am i why is that

535
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,645
产品如P立方倍P立方C3P.
product like P cubed times P cubed C 3 P

536
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,535
立方体NT3P立方体，给我C3D3
cubed NT 3 P cube that gives me C 3 D 3

537
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,614
P到6次方
P to the 6th power

538
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:27,135
怎么了我该怎么办是的
so what's up what do I do yeah yes

539
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,285
那是周期性部分的关键
that's the key that's the periodic part

540
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,565
P到4等于身份谢谢你
P to the 4 equal the identity thank ya

541
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,965
所以P到第六项真的是P
so the P to the sixth term is really a P

542
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,235
平方项P到第五项是
squared term the P to the fifth term is

543
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,415
真的是P到P到第四学期
really a P term the P to the fourth term

544
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,945
真的是0到0的P所以是的
is really a P to the 0 term so yeah so

545
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,604
我只是在做我正在做的事情
I'm I'm just doing I'm doing what I'm

546
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:56,864
做循环卷积实际上让我
doing cyclic convolution actually let me

547
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:01,284
只是说当我倍增的时候
just say when I'm multiplying yeah

548
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:04,925
所以我现在告诉你我能做什么
so I'm now I'm telling you what I can

549
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,844
首先告诉你卷积是什么和
first tell you what convolution is and

550
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,364
那么什么循环卷积是这
then what cyclic convolution is and this

551
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:11,465
是真的听这个，因为它是
is real listen up to this because it's

552
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,645
知道这是件好事
it's a good thing to know

553
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,984
是的首先是卷积
yeah so first of all convolution

554
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:18,814
所以我们假设我想接受
so we suppose I want to take the

555
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:23,584
这是三个一二的卷积
convolution of three one two that's

556
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,955
通常是卷积的符号
often the symbol for convolution with

557
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:35,104
四个六个一个没关系，那怎么办我怎么样
four six one okay so how do i how what

558
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:37,534
这是否意味着我有一个矢量
does that mean I've got a vector so

559
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,604
什么对我有什么好处隐藏在那里
what's high for me what's hiding there

560
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:46,205
是多项式三加X加二
is is polynomials three plus X plus two

561
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,084
x平方乘以4加6x加1x
x squared times four plus 6x plus one x

562
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,994
平方，我只是将它们相乘
squared and I just multiply them out and

563
00:37:54,999 --> 00:38:03,695
我得到五，所以我得到3次4给我一个
I get five so I get 3 times 4 gives me a

564
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:09,544
123次6x是18x但我也有
12 3 times 6x is 18x but I've also got

565
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:15,064
从这里开始4倍，所以我得到22X所以我只是
4x from here so I've got 22 X so I just

566
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:18,064
做多项式的乘法
do that multiplication of polynomials

567
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:21,994
和我在做什么是卷积
and what I'm doing is convolution with

568
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:25,024
向量，这是你写的方式
the vectors and here's the way you wrote

569
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:29,274
它在一年级
it in in first grade

570
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:33,774
好的，所以这里的一年级还好
okay so here's first grade okay

571
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:37,564
2128这是你还没学会的
212 8 this is you haven't learned to

572
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:41,314
随身携带，所以12在那里12
carry yeah so 12 goes in there as 12

573
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:50,104
然后1是461和3是12183然后
then 1 is 4 6 1 & 3 is 12 18 3 and then

574
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:59,195
你加起来所以你有2131722和12
you add up so you have 2 13 17 22 and 12

575
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,284
让我这样，这就是答案
let me just so so that that's the answer

576
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:05,135
还有，他们的卷积我想我
there that their convolution I guess I

577
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,814
必须从是啊123次4
have to take it from yeah 12 3 times 4

578
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:13,415
现在给了12次3次6次加1次4次
gave 12 now 3 times 6 plus 1 times 4

579
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,035
那是22
that's the 22

580
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,575
哦，是的，我们已经开始了，但现在
oh yeah we already started here but now

581
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:22,255
那之后是什么，为什么我说七
what's after that 17 why did I say seven

582
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,915
牙齿哦八加六加三
teeth oh eight plus six plus three

583
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,815
谢谢
Thanks

584
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,415
十七，然后十二加一
seventeen and then twelve plus one

585
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:39,905
十三，然后-那是非循环的
thirteen and then - that's non-cyclic so

586
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,605
如果我想要它，那就是卷积哦
that's convolution oh if I if I want it

587
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:48,145
非循环我不放圆圈
to be non-cyclic I don't put a circle in

588
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,735
所以这是普通人的象征
so that's a symbol for ordinary

589
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,375
如果您执行MATLAB命令，则进行卷积
convolution if you do the MATLAB command

590
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,215
如果你给它卷积的CoNV
Co NV for convolution if you gave it

591
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,535
那些矢量它会给你五个
those vectors it would give you five a

592
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,455
结果有五个组件的向量
vector with five components as a result

593
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,785
但是如果你现在让我做六个像
but if you now let me make it six like

594
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,315
好的，那么现在会发生什么
okay so what's going to happen now when

595
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,885
我让它循环，所以这代表12
I make it cyclic so this represents 12

596
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:20,975
22P17P平方13P立方和什么
22 P 17 P squared 13 P cubed and what

597
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,305
如果我正在做的话，那就是13P立方体
happens what's 13 P cubed if I'm doing

598
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,535
如果n是3而我正在做3乘3矩阵
if n is 3 and I'm doing 3 by 3 matrices

599
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:36,005
然后13P立方体与13右P相同
then 13 P cube is the same as 13 right P

600
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,275
立方体是我所以13将回到那里
cube is I so the 13 will go back there

601
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,115
2将是P4，它会去
and the 2 will be P 4th and it'll go

602
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:49,145
回到P所以现在用卷积
back as P so so the now with convolution

603
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:56,765
循环卷积给出12和132522
cyclic convolution gives 12 and 13 25 22

604
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:03,875
和224和17好吧所以我得到了我
and 224 and the 17 okay so I've get I'm

605
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,255
我只是回到长度为3的向量
getting back a vector of length 3 I just

606
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,845
如果我有3乘3，我想做什么
as I want to do if I have a 3 by 3

607
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:15,395
矩阵卷积循环循环
matrix convolution cyclic circulant

608
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,705
矩阵是那三个对角线和
matrix were those three diagonals and

609
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,925
这三个对角线，我想要的
these three diagonals and I want the

610
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,875
回答是三个矩阵3
answer to be a three by three matrix

611
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,915
这些对角线是如此再次矩阵
were these diagonals so again matrix

612
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,595
乘法
multiplication

613
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,565
循环矩阵完全对应
circulant matrices corresponds exactly

614
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:36,395
周期性地乘以多项式
to multiplying polynomials cyclically

615
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,705
那是循环卷积然后
and that's cyclic convolution and then

616
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,985
只有一个小技巧，看看是否
there's just one little trick to see if

617
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,355
你相信我的数字是正确的
you've got the numbers right I believe

618
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,675
如果3加1，那应该是真的
that it should be true that if 3 plus 1

619
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,075
加2是64加6加1是11和我
plus 2 is 6 4 plus 6 plus 1 is 11 and I

620
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,345
相信那些应该添加到
believe that those should add to add to

621
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:06,625
什么我希望他们添加266
what what do I hope that they add 266

622
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,865
这样做我有点紧张
I'm a little nervous about doing it but

623
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:17,675
我想我们可以，所以4950966检查
I think we can yeah so 49 50 966 check

624
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,185
是的所以数字是总和
yeah so the the digits the sum of the

625
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,685
一个因子的数字乘以总和
digits of one factor multiplies the sum

626
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,395
的另一个因素的数字
of the digits of the other factor to

627
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,735
给出数字的总和
give the sum of the digits in the

628
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,285
卷积，这是真的
convolution and that would be true

629
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,625
我们是否做了循环
whether we doing cyclic which is

630
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,015
把13和管子带回来或
bringing the 13 and the tube back in or

631
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,555
不循环我们有五个
not cyclic where where we have five

632
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,215
数字是的，所以这实际上是一个
numbers yeah so that's that's actually a

633
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,385
检查一点，我不知道是否
check that little that I don't know if

634
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,905
你曾经想到过这一点
you've ever thought about that in second

635
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,635
年级
grade

636
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,635
乘以这些数字乘以
multiplying these numbers multiplying

637
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,175
这个数字被这个数字和获取
that number by that number and getting

638
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,805
一些答案，可能是一半
some answer which probably half the

639
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:09,035
类没有得到正确的那么五年级
class did not get right then 5th grade

640
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,755
他们有点得到它但是
they've they're kind of getting it but

641
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,695
如果他们知道支票就可以了
if they knew a check so they could have

642
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,665
刚添加这些数字以获得11
just added these numbers to get 11 added

643
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,455
这些数字得到6乘以那些
these numbers to get 6 multiplied those

644
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,295
获得66并检查那些
to get 66 and check that that those

645
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:30,125
添加266我从来没有发生在我身上
added 266 I'd never had occurred to me

646
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,795
我承认和二年级都没有
I admit and second grade neither but

647
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,605
这是一件好事，现在你已经知道你
it's a good thing now you know now you

648
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:42,685
可以通过二年级，所以这是
can pass second grade okay so so this is

649
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:46,415
循环卷积的图片和我
the picture for cyclic convolution and I

650
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,335
还剩下几分钟告诉你
just have a few minutes left to tell you

651
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,675
关于特征值和特征向量
about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors

652
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,835
这些矩阵所以你能告诉我们什么
of these matrices so what can you tell

653
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,135
我关于特征值，我说的
me about the eigenvalues and i say the

654
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,845
特征向量我有一个矩阵p发生
eigenvectors i have a matrix p happens

655
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,905
作为一个排列矩阵，但它是一个
to be a permutation matrix but it's a

656
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,835
矩阵然后我把这个多项式
matrix then I take this polynomial in

657
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,645
什么可以告诉我什么矩阵
the matrix what can you tell me about

658
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,405
这个矩阵的特征向量C所以我
the eigenvectors of this matrix C so I

659
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,635
写我的C看起来像
have write my C looks like looks like

660
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,135
那个，我问你的
that and I'm asking you for the

661
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,015
那个特征向量，我就是这么说的
eigenvectors of that and I'm saying that

662
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,915
这是一个是多项式的和
that is a is a sum of is a polynomial

663
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:40,105
P的权力总和实际上是这样的
sum of powers of P like so in fact

664
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,615
这里的数字刚刚从对角线上掉下来
numbers here just come off the diagonals

665
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:50,675
那么特征向量呢？
so what about the eigenvectors well that

666
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,135
是一个特征向量，它是真正的向量
is an eigenvector that's true the vector

667
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,105
所有的人将与特征向量
of all ones will be an eigenvector with

668
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:01,925
什么特征值实际是啊是啊所以我
what eigenvalue actually yeah yeah so I

669
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:05,965
我想让你看到的是
what I wanted to want you to see is the

670
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,395
C的特征向量与
eigenvectors of C are the same as the

671
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,825
如果我有一个P的特征向量
eigenvectors of P if I have an

672
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,775
p的特征向量也是一个
eigenvector of p that's also an

673
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,175
p平方和P立方的特征向量
eigenvector of p squared and P cubed and

674
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:25,465
P的特征向量的组合
a combination so eigenvectors of P are

675
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:31,805
座位的特征向量
eigenvectors of seats

676
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,085
那么问题是什么呢
so then the question is what are the

677
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,145
P的特征向量你明白我的意思
eigenvectors of P you see what I mean

678
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,785
它不是真的没关系
that it doesn't it didn't really matter

679
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,445
如果我正在寻找特征向量的东西
if I'm looking for eigenvectors what

680
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,315
那些数字是重点
those numbers were the point is that

681
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,985
这些数字在对角线上是恒定的
those numbers were constant on diagonals

682
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,645
因此他们我拥有它
and that they therefore they I have it's

683
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,795
由一个内置的矩阵P构建而成
built out of one matrix P built out of

684
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,255
一个矩阵P所以我所要做的就是
one matrix P so if all I have to do is

685
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,395
P是的的特征向量所以这是
the eigenvectors of P yep so that's the

686
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,795
这里的最后一步是什么
final step here what are the

687
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:13,835
p的特征向量和特征值
eigenvectors and eigenvalues of p so

688
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:24,935
特征向量p的特征值等于11
eigenvectors eigenvalues for p equal 1 1

689
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:34,715
1和1说，否则0所以有人
1 and 1 say and otherwise 0 so somebody

690
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,545
提到了1111的向量
mentioned that the vector of 1 1 1 1

691
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:43,115
这是一个特征向量，因为如果我
that that is an eigenvector because if I

692
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,095
做那个乘法它改变了这一点
do that multiplication it shifts this

693
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,525
矢量向下和循环周围但是
vector down and cyclically around but

694
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,485
这只是带回相同的矢量
that just brings back the same vector so

695
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:59,245
lambda是1，这是一个特征向量
lambda is 1 and that's an eigenvector

696
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,595
特征值为1，但这是4乘4
with eigenvalue 1 but this is a 4 by 4

697
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,525
矩阵
matrix

698
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,955
哦，现在你猜1个减1负
oh now you're guessing 1 minus 1 1 minus

699
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,315
1有趣的好吧告诉我一个
1 interesting well right tell me an

700
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:24,155
如果你想要兄弟，那么特征向量4减去1
eigenvector 4 minus 1 if you want to bro

701
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,205
只是在那里交替标志让我
just alternating signs there so let me

702
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:33,965
让我做倍增时间1
let me do that multiplication times 1

703
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,535
减11减去1我当然没有
minus 1 1 minus 1 of course I don't have

704
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,235
做这个乘法我只是去
to do this multiplication I'm just going

705
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,605
转移这个，所以我要转移它
to shift this so I'm going to shift that

706
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,975
下
down

707
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,815
1减11并循环周围和
1 minus 1 1 and cyclically around and

708
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,595
现在它的特征值是什么
now what's the eigenvalue it is an

709
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,565
特征向量和特征值是什么
eigenvector and what's the eigenvalue

710
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,375
这使得该矢量的多个
that makes what multiple of that vector

711
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:07,825
给出了这个向量减去1的结果
gives that gives that vector minus 1 so

712
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:12,145
这是一个好主意，但剩下的
that was a good idea but the rest of

713
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:16,965
你说的是一个坏主意，因为
what you said was was a bad idea because

714
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,275
我们必须看下一个特征向量
we've got to look the next eigen vectors

715
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,955
我们必须在别的地方
are got to be somewhere else we've just

716
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,114
有一个特征值出现在1那里，
got one eigenvalue there on 1 there and

717
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,265
我们还没有得到其他两个还等什么
we haven't got the other two so what are

718
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,375
另外两个特征值
the other two eigenvalues of this

719
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:40,104
排列矩阵一个是正​​确的
permutation matrix one that's right

720
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:43,614
我们在一个循环的世界画一个圆圈
we're in a circulant world draw a circle

721
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,275
所以特征向量是四个根
so the eigenvectors are the four roots

722
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,015
一个复合体，一个又一个
of one complex so one and minus one

723
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,525
你有这些是lambda，但是
you've got these are the lambdas but the

724
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:01,135
其他的是我和我是的，为什么
other ones are i and- i yeah yep why

725
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,675
不让我离开，直到因为时间到让
don't I leave until since time's up let

726
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,035
我离开星期五的特征值
me leave until Friday the eigen values

727
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:14,695
和一般的特征向量
and eigen vectors for in general for

728
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,205
任意大小，但这是一张图片
arbitrary size but that's a picture of

729
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:22,045
特征我们接近于本征
the eigen we're close to the eigen

730
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,825
每个人的向量和特征值
vectors and eigen values of every all

731
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,095
循环具有相同的特征向量
circulant have the same eigen vectors

732
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,635
所有的循环都有特征向量
all circulant have that eigenvector also

733
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,005
所有循环都有四个四分之一
four by four all circulant have that

734
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,465
特征向量四乘四，我们会发现
eigenvector four by four and we'll find

735
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,685
另外两个好，所以我会见到你
the other two okay so I'll see you

736
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:44,335
周五为那些和卷积
