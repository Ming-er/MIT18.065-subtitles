00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,795
好了，所以我想在再次回升
okay so I'd like to pick up again on the

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,465
离子这个整齐的矩阵族
ion this neat family of matrices

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,785
循环矩阵，但首先让我说
circulant matrices but first let me say

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,005
在这里然后把它放在网上我的
here and then put it on the web my

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,694
考虑到这些项目，所以我想
thought about the projects so I think

14
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:44,065
我可以给出的最后期限是
the last deadline and I can give is the

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,265
最后一堂课所以我认为不是下一个
final class so I think that's not next

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,694
一周，但是下一周的星期三
week but Wednesday of the following week

17
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:54,445
我认为这是我们的最后一次课堂会议
I think is our last class meeting so be

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,865
很高兴他们当时或早些时候，如果
great to get them then or earlier and if

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,115
任何人或每个人都想说
anybody or everybody would like to tell

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,965
关于他们的课程
the class a little bit about their

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,875
项目，你知道这是一个友好的
project you know it's a friendly

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,515
观众和我很高兴
audience and and I'd be happy to make

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,655
空间和时间，所以给我一个
space and time for that so so send me an

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,754
如果你或者给我发电子邮件
email if you or and and give me the

25
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,245
如果你愿意，可以提前预定
project earlier if you would like to

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,095
只是在课堂上说几句话，甚至是
just say a few words in class or even if

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,855
你愿意多说几句话
you are willing to say a few words in

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,545
我会说是的，因为我意识到了
class I'll say yeah because I realize

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,135
是的，所以其他问题也是如此
yeah okay so other questions about so so

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,954
我们完成了所有的p-sets等等
we're finished with all p-sets and so on

31
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,894
所以这真的只是一个项目，是的
so it's really just a project and yeah

32
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,195
它是如何分级好的问题，但它是
how is it graded good question but it's

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,094
会成为我
going to be me

34
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,894
我想是的，所以我会阅读所有的项目
I guess so so I'll read all the projects

35
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,185
不知怎的，你拿出一个等级
and come up with a grade somehow you

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,245
知道我，我希望你们有
know I my I hope you guys have

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,825
了解我，你知道我的感觉
understood that I'm you know my feeling

38
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,945
是这门课程的成绩是
is that the grades in this course are

39
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,915
会因为偏高而偏高
going to be on the high side because

40
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,225
他们应该是啊我认为这是它的
they should be yeah I think it's a it's

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,925
那种课程，我问你
that kind of a course and I'm asked you

42
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,155
无论如何要做相当数量
for to do a fair amount and anyway

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,005
这是我的起点，而且还有一个
that's my starting basis and there's a

44
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,195
很多主题，如循环矩阵
lot of topics like circulant matrices

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,264
我不是要能够给
that I'm not going to be able to give

46
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:33,624
你当然是我的一部分
you a piece set about but I of course

47
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:35,755
这些都是可以密切
these are closely can

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,124
这对于离散傅立叶变换
that to the discrete Fourier transform

49
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:46,435
所以让我写下这个名字吧
so let me just write the name of the

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,975
伟大的人傅立叶如此离散
great man Fourier so the discrete

51
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,605
傅立叶变换就像你所知道的那样
Fourier transform is as you know very

52
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,645
非常重要的算法
very important algorithm in in

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,874
工程学和数学
engineering and in mathematics

54
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,484
到处都是傅立叶只是一个关键的想法
everywhere Fourier is just a key idea

55
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,135
所以我觉得这是一个好的知道
and so I think it's just good to know

56
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,764
关于那些循环矩阵是什么
about those so circulant matrices are

57
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:19,195
与有限大小连接
connected with with the finite size

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,645
矩阵矩阵和一些矩阵
matrices matrices of size and some are

59
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,824
循环矩阵将由n和n组成
circulant matrices will be n by n and

60
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:37,734
你还记得这个特殊形式
you remember this special form so this

61
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,905
这是关于这些矩阵的关键点
is a key point about these matrices see

62
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,395
它们的定义不是n平方
that they are defined by not n squared

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,344
如果你告诉我的话，只有n个条目
entries only n if you tell me just the

64
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,495
矩阵的第一行，这就是全部
first row of the matrix and that's all

65
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,525
你会告诉MATLAB说C0C1C2C.
you would tell MATLAB say C 0 C 1 C 2 C

66
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,695
和负1并且为循环
and minus 1 and for a circulant that's

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,525
所有我需要知道的因为这些
all I need to know because these

68
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,185
这条对角线的对角线是恒定的
diagonals are constant this diagonal is

69
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,794
常数C1然后完成
constant C 1 and then gets completed

70
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,264
这里C两个对角线来到C2然后
here C two diagonal come to C 2 and then

71
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,945
在这里循环完成所以M
gets completed cyclically here so M

72
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,815
数字，而不是n平方和那个
numbers and not n squared and that the

73
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,224
我提到的原因或原因是
reason I mention that or a reason is

74
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:31,075
那是一个很大的卖点
that's there that's a big selling point

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,134
当你去同一台机器的应用程序
when you go to applications same machine

76
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,985
学习图像让你记住
learning in for images so you remember

77
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,995
机器学习的大局
the big picture of machine learning

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,515
深刻的学习是你的
deep deep learning was that you had

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,975
样本
samples

80
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:55,215
很多样本让我们说n个样本
a lot of samples let's say n samples

81
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,095
也许然后这个图像中的每个样本
maybe and then each sample in this image

82
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,455
部分将是一个图像所以事情是
part will be an image so the thing is

83
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,505
图像由其像素描述
that an image is described by its pixels

84
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,855
如果我有千千万
and if I have a thousand by thousand

85
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,465
像素这样一百万
pixel so that's a million a million

86
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,575
像素它是特征向量的
pixels it the the feature vector the

87
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,825
与一个样本相关联的向量
vector that's associated with one sample

88
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,495
是巨大的是如此巨大，所以我发泄
is enormous is enormous so so so I vents

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,865
安瓿但也许可能很好，如果他们是
ampuls but maybe maybe well if they're

90
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,835
百万突然变成的颜色
in color that million suddenly becomes

91
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,815
三百万说三百万
three million so say three million

92
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:48,645
功能所以我们的矢量我们的矢量
features so our vectors our vector of

93
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,965
那整个计算深刻
that the whole computation of deep

94
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,785
学习与我们的向量一起工作
learning works with our vectors with

95
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,265
三百万个组件，这意味着
three million components and that means

96
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,455
如果我们不这样做的话
that in the ordinary way if we didn't do

97
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,125
我们将成倍增加的任何特殊事物
anything special we would be multiplying

98
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,125
那些大小像三的矩阵
those by matrices of size like three

99
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,785
百万三百万我们会
million times three million we would be

100
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,305
计算的是这是许多像权重
computing that many weights that's like

101
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,225
这是不可能的，我们会这样
impossible that's like and we would be

102
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,825
为...中的每一层计算
computing that for for each layer in the

103
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,615
深度网络，所以它会上升到一个正常的
deep network so it would go up a normai

104
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,035
它增加了三百万
it go up so three million by three

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,185
百万只是我们无法计算我们
million is just we can't compute we

106
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,615
不能使用梯度下降来优化
can't use gradient descent to optimize

107
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,845
许多重量所以重点是这一点
that many weight so the point is that

108
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,545
深度学习中的矩阵是
the matrices in deep learning are

109
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,615
特别的，他们不依赖他们
special and they don't depend they they

110
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,065
就像他们可能的循环矩阵一样
are like circulant matrices they might

111
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,605
不循环所以循环矩阵
not loop around so circulant matrices

112
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,905
有这样的循环功能，使
have this cyclic feature that that makes

113
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,585
理论完美非常好
the theory perfect extremely nice

114
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,215
但一般我们当然
but of course in general we have

115
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:13,235
矩阵让我们说Tt0不变
matrices let's say T t0 constant

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,185
对角线，也许是一堆对角线
diagonals and maybe bunch of diagonals

117
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,145
在这里不一定是对称的或
in here not necessarily symmetric or

118
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,155
它们可能是对称的，但它们不是
they might be symmetric but they're not

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,705
循环所以这些矩阵叫什么
cyclic so what are these matrices called

120
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,845
好吧，他们有一堆名字，因为
well they have a bunch of names because

121
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,345
他们是如此重要，他们是他们
they're so important they're they're

122
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,435
线性移位不变或线性时间
linear shift invariant or linear time

123
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,435
无论什么是正确的词
invariant whatever is the right word in

124
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,275
你的背景所以他们就是这样
your context so so they're they're

125
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,235
卷积你可以称之为
convolutions you could call it a

126
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,075
卷积矩阵乘以时
convolution matrix when they multiply by

127
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,415
其中一个矩阵，我想我要走了
one of these matrices I guess I'm going

128
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,985
称它为T优正在尽
to call it t you're doing our

129
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,245
卷积，我会写得更好
convolution and I'll better write down

130
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,245
我们卷积的公式你是
the formula for our convolution you're

131
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,405
除非是，否则不进行循环卷积
not doing a cyclic convolution unless

132
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,765
矩阵周期循环这个时候
the matrix cycles round this would when

133
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,855
你乘以C这会给你一个
you multiply by C this would give you a

134
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:25,265
循环卷积说我是否乘以C
cyclic convolution say if I multiply C

135
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,555
通过一些向量V，结果是
by some vector V the result is the

136
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,925
C矢量的循环卷积
cyclic convolution of the C vector with

137
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,685
V矢量这么大C是一个矩阵但是
the V vector so big C is a matrix but

138
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,715
但它完全由第一个定义
but it's completely defined by its first

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,465
行或第一列，所以它真的是我
row or first column so it's really I

140
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,955
只是在那里有一个矢量操作
just have a vector operation there and

141
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,735
这是一个循环的，在这里T次
it's a cyclic one and over here T times

142
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,535
向量V将是的卷积
a vector V will be the convolution of a

143
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:05,195
T矢量与V但不循环和
T vector with V but not cyclic and

144
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,355
可能这些就是那些
probably these are the ones that would

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,995
实际上是进来机器学习的
actually come in to machine learning so

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,735
线性移位不变线性时间
linear shift invariant linear time

147
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,144
不变
invariant

148
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,144
我把它叫做这么掩盖人们会
I would call it so mask people would

149
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:25,045
称之为三元组矩阵，这就是它
call it a triplets matrix so that's

150
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,755
这就是我用字母T的原因
that's why I used the letter T in

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,425
工程它将是一个过滤器或
engineering it would be a filter or a

152
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,325
卷积或是恒定的对角线
convolution or are constant diagonal

153
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:47,045
矩阵这些出现在各种各样的地方
matrix these come up all sorts of places

154
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,855
他们进入机器学习
and they come up in in machine learning

155
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,715
和图像处理，但基本上
and with image processing but basically

156
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,235
因为你在某一点上做了什么
because what you're doing at one point

157
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,785
在图像中它几乎就是你的样子
in an image it's pretty much what you're

158
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,285
要在其他点做
going to do at the other points

159
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,805
你不会想出特别的
you're not gonna figure out special

160
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,175
每个小像素的权重
weights for each little pixel in the

161
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,365
像你要去如果你必须要
image you're going to take if you have

162
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,175
一张图片说你有一张图片
an image say you have an image with with

163
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,465
数以万亿计的像素
zillions of pixels

164
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,565
好吧，你可能想减少我的意思
well you might want to cut down I mean

165
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,894
你最明智的做法是非常明智的
you'd be very sensible to do some max

166
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:29,675
汇集一些池化操作
pooling some pooling operations to make

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:39,485
它小，所以真的很喜欢我们没关系
it smaller so that's really like okay we

168
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,185
我们不能不想要这个更大的系统
can't we don't want this larger system

169
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,644
让我们减少它，以便最大限度地利用它
let's just reduce it so max pooling that

170
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:52,415
操作会说他们三个
operation would be say take them three

171
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,195
在九个像素的时间和替换
at a time from nine pixels and replace

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,675
那九个像素乘以一个像素所以最大
that nine pixels by one pixel so the max

173
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,435
这九个数字中的一个
of those nine numbers that would be a

174
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,165
非常简单的操作，只是减少
very simple operation that just reduces

175
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,135
使尺寸变小的尺寸
the dimension that's make it smaller

176
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:16,075
减少尺寸
reduce the dimension

177
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,025
好吧，这是一个廉价的方式来做到这一点
okay so that's a cheap way to make it

178
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,355
制作四次或九次图像
make an image for four times or nine

179
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,395
时间或者小64倍但是
times or 64 times smaller but the

180
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,825
卷积部分现在不是
convolution part now so that's not

181
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,635
涉及卷积，这是一个不同的
involving convolution that's a different

182
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,605
如果我采取这里的操作甚至不是线性的
operation here not even linear if I take

183
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,165
每个框中的最大值不是线性的
the max in each box that's not a linear

184
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,575
操作，但这是一个快速的，所以
operation so but it's a fast one okay so

185
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,345
现在哪里循环飙升卷积
now where do circulant soar convolution

186
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,805
或三元组矩阵或过滤器来
or triplets matrices or filters come

187
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,895
进入它所以我会忘记最大值
into it so I'll forget about the max

188
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,905
冷却假设发生了，我
cooling suppose that's happened and I

189
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,845
N还有一个非常大的系统
still have a very big system with N

190
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,815
平方
squared

191
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,355
每个像素和平方特征
pixels and squared features in for each

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,895
样本，所以我想操作
sample so that's so I want to operate on

193
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,945
通过矩阵像往常一样我想
that by matrices as usual I want to

194
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,555
选择权重来突出
choose the weights to bring out the

195
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,465
重点，所以整个想法都在
important points so the whole idea is on

196
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,135
这样的图像我将使用卷积
a image like that I'll use a convolution

197
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,015
我将使用相同的操作
I'll use this the same operation is

198
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,595
发生在每一点，所以如果忘记了
happening at each point so if so forget

199
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,015
如果我能找到，最大部分让我擦除
the max part let me erase if I can find

200
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,325
橡皮擦在这里好吧所以我不会
an eraser here okay so I'm I'm not gonna

201
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,085
我们已经完成了这个，所以我现在就完成了
we've done this so that's done now I

202
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,015
想重量乘以它使
want to multiply it by weight so that

203
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,945
那已经做好了所以我是什么
that's already done okay so what am I

204
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,805
期待做什么是什么样的
looking to do what was it what kind of a

205
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,405
过滤器会做一个低通滤波器
job would a filter do a low-pass filter

206
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,765
会杀死或几乎杀死高
would kill or nearly kill the high

207
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:24,025
如果我愿意的话，可以对噪音进行调频
frequencies the noise so if I wanted to

208
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,595
在那里我会使用一个更简单的图像
get a simpler image there I would use a

209
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,465
洛佩
lope

210
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,945
过滤器可能就是这个
filter which might just it might be this

211
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,325
这个过滤器让我放入
this filter here with let me just put in

212
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:46,205
一些可以说是a的数字
some numbers that would that would say a

213
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:52,435
一半，所以我平均每个
half and a half so I'm averaging each

214
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,345
像素与邻居只是取出
pixel with its neighbor just to take out

215
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,005
一些高频率低
some of the high frequencies the low

216
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,675
频率是恒定的图像黑色
frequencies are constant image a black

217
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,045
所有的黑色图像都不会出现
all black image would come out not

218
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:12,005
改变了但是一个非常高度斑点的图像
changed but a very highly speckled image

219
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,945
将被大大消除
would get largely removed by that

220
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,455
平均，所以我的想法是一样的
averaging so I it's the same idea that

221
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,405
所有人说没有处理
comes up in all of say no processing

222
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,935
过滤所以只是为了完成这个
filtering so just to complete this

223
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:34,865
想到为什么更广泛的神经
thought of how why does a wider neural

224
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:40,955
网，所以我回答这个问题为什么
nets so I'm answering this question why

225
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,175
他们是如何进入机器学习的
how do they come in machine learning

226
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,075
所以他们来样的时候
so they come when when the samples are

227
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,545
图像，然后很自然地用AA
images and then it's natural to use a a

228
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,585
恒定对角矩阵一个移位
constant diagonal matrix a shift

229
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,305
不变矩阵而不是任意的
invariant matrix and not an arbitrary

230
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,135
矩阵，所以我们只需要计算
matrix so we're we only have to compute

231
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,585
n权重，而不是N平方是啊
n weights and not N squared yeah

232
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,705
这就是重点，这是一个原因
so that's the point so that's one reason

233
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:18,185
谈论卷积和
for talking about convolution and

234
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,865
本课程中的循环矩阵I.
circulant matrices in this course I

235
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,855
猜我觉得另一个原因是
guess I feel another reason is that

236
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,365
与DFT有关的一切
everything to do with the DFT with

237
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,795
傅立叶和傅立叶的傅立叶
Fourier it with Fourier and Fourier

238
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,045
变换和隐斜矩阵
transforms and phoria matrices

239
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,405
这就像你必须了解我的东西
that's just like stuff you got to know I

240
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,665
这意味着你每次拥有自己
mean that's every time you have a you're

241
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,625
处理矢量
dealing with vector

242
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,475
这是我们正在转移的一种转变
that are sort of shift we're shifting

243
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,564
向量进入它是为了
the vectors comes into it that's for

244
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,324
EA会进来，所以这只是我们
EA's gonna come in so it's just we

245
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:55,685
应该看到你好，所以现在我可以
should see for you okay so now can i

246
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:03,475
我会回到这个特别好的案例
I'll go back to this specially nice case

247
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,295
矩阵循环的位置
where the where the the matrix loops

248
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,245
我周围有这种循环
around where I have this cyclic

249
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,785
卷积所以这是-循环的
convolution so so this are-- cyclic

250
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,694
因为周围的东西和循环
because of the looping around stuff and

251
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,514
让我们找到哦，那是什么意思
let's find oh so what was the point of

252
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,785
上次我开始这个
last time I I started with this

253
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,365
置换矩阵和置换
permutation matrix and the permutation

254
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:42,564
矩阵有C0等于0C1等于1和
matrix has C 0 equals 0 C 1 equal 1 and

255
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:48,355
C的其余部分都是0所以它只是
the rest of the C's are 0 so it's just

256
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,155
乘法的这个效果得到
the effect of multiplying by this get a

257
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,764
在这附近的盒子效果
box around it here the effect of

258
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,254
乘以这个排列矩阵
multiplying by this permutation matrix

259
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,715
是转移一切，然后带来
is to shift everything and then bring

260
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,885
最后一个到顶部所以这是一个
the last one up to the top so it's a

261
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,064
循环移位所以治安官是六件事
cyclic shift so six things sheriff is

262
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,635
外面，我想在最后
outside and I guess at the very end of

263
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,005
上次我问它的时候
last time I was asking about its

264
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,404
特征值和特征向量也可以
eigenvalues and eigenvectors so can we

265
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,105
来到那个问题所以这是一个
come to that question so that's a

266
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,865
我在这里开始提出一切问题
starting question for everything here I

267
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,975
我猜我们也明白这一点
guess we've understood that too to get

268
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,054
更深入到矩阵的特征值
deeper into a matrix its eigenvalues

269
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,875
特征向量或奇异值奇异
eigenvectors or singular value singular

270
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,585
矢量实际上是什么方式
vectors are the way to go actually what

271
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,164
将是那个的奇异价值
would be the singular values of that

272
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:50,794
矩阵，所以，呃，是的，让我们来吧
matrix so that's uh yeah just lets let's

273
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,164
只考虑奇异的价值观
just think about singular values and

274
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,044
那么我们就会明白为什么它的特征值
then we'll see why why its eigenvalues

275
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:56,435
我们
we

276
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,535
说-他们是独一无二的
saying - they're one of the singular

277
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,225
它们的排列矩阵的值
values of a permutation matrix they're

278
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,175
所有这一个矩阵都是一个
all one all one that matrix is a

279
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:14,255
正交矩阵所以SVD的
orthogonal matrix so the the SVD of the

280
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,335
矩阵就像排列和
matrix just has like the permutation and

281
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,365
那么身份因此是西格玛
then the identity is therefore the Sigma

282
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,295
因此西格玛是我的伙伴
so Sigma is I for this mate for this

283
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:33,745
矩阵不是那么奇异值不
matrix not so the singular values don't

284
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,055
现在我想如果我们那是因为P
and now I guess if we that's because P

285
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,415
转置P是单位矩阵
transpose P is the identity matrix

286
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,125
任何时候我都认为那是正交的
anytime I have that that's an orthogonal

287
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,885
矩阵然后可能随时P转置P
matrix then maybe anytime P transpose P

288
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,005
是奇异值的标识
is the identity the singular values will

289
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,015
是身份和特征的本征值
be the eigen values of the identity and

290
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,075
就在那里，他们只是那些人
that's there they're all just ones the

291
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,415
P的本征值是我们想要的
eigen values of P that's what we want to

292
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,945
发现所以，让我们这样做
find so let's do that

293
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:06,655
P的特征值是好的，所以一种方法是
okay eigen values of P so one way is to

294
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:14,795
采取P减去lambda我就是我们的方式
take P minus lambda I that's the way we

295
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,405
教在1806年，从来没有如此反复使用
teach in 1806 and never use again so

296
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,765
它是对角线上的负λ和
it's minus lambda on the diagonal and of

297
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:30,385
当然P坐在这里然后
course P is sitting up here and then

298
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,975
好吧，所以现在遵循1806规则我
okay so now following the 1806 rule I

299
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,835
应该采取那个确定的权利和
should take that determinate right and

300
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,445
将它设置为零为什么不是这一个
set it to zero why don't one this is one

301
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,275
在极少数情况下我们可以
of the very few occasions we can

302
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,325
真正做到这一点，以便让我做，所以
actually do it so allow me to do it so

303
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,605
这个井的决定因素是什么？
what is the determinant of this well

304
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,235
是的，那就是那个lambda
yeah there's that there's that lambda to

305
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:02,075
第四个，我想我认为这是羔羊
the fourth and I guess I think it's lamb

306
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,225
到第四个减去一个，我认为是
to the fourth minus one I think that's

307
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,785
正确的决定因素
the right determinant

308
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:13,465
那肯定有财产所以我
that certainly has has property so I

309
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,495
将设置为零，那么我会找到
would set that to zero then I would find

310
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,535
那个特征值会
that the the eigenvalues for that will

311
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,935
是一减一，我和减去我
be one and minus one and I and minus I

312
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:35,665
而他们是为如果他们的
and they're the for for if they're the

313
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,485
一个lambda的第四根是第四个
fourth roots of one lambda the fourth

314
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,385
等于我们这是我们的等式
equal one that's our that's our equation

315
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,485
这是我们的特征值方程lambda
that's our eigenvalue equation lambda

316
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,155
第四个等于1或lambda到N.
the fourth equal 1 or lambda to the N

317
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,174
续集之一，所以会是什么
sequel one so what would be the

318
00:20:50,179 --> 00:21:00,475
自由p8x8的特征值
eigenvalues for for the free p 8x8 this

319
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,965
当然是复杂的平面
is the complex plane of course real and

320
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:10,245
想象中有一个Tigan值
imaginary so that's got a Tigan values

321
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,755
我们想成为的8次方将是
we want to be the 8th power would be the

322
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,135
身份和那意味着lambda到
identity and that means that lambda to

323
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,285
的8次方是一个特征值
the 8th power is one for the eigenvalues

324
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,385
什么是八个解决方案
and what are the eight solutions every

325
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,545
八度多项式方程
polynomial equation of degree eight has

326
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,304
得到八个解决方案
got to have eight solutions

327
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:35,815
那是高斯的基本定理
that's Gauss's fundamental theorem of

328
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,495
代数八种解决方案那么它们是什么
algebra eight solutions so what are they

329
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,375
那八个数字是八分之一
what are the eight numbers whose eighth

330
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,525
权力给你们所有人都知道的
power gives one you all probably know

331
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,275
他们所以他们当然是第八个
them so they're one of course the eighth

332
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,605
一个的力量是-1的能量，即第八个
power of one is power of -1 the 8th

333
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,455
减去我的权力和其他人都
power of minus I and the other guys are

334
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,965
就在这里，一个人的根源是平等的
just here the roots of one are equally

335
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,545
围绕圆圈间隔，所以傅立叶是
spaced around the circle so Fourier is

336
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,115
进来吧
come in

337
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,335
你知道傅立叶在他们看到的时候会醒来
you know Fourier wakes up when they sees

338
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,085
这张照片就在这里
that picture for here is gonna be here

339
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,245
它将在特征向量中
and it'll be in the eigenvectors so

340
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,065
你还可以使用特征值
you okay with the eigenvalues the

341
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,475
P的特征值将是这多少让
eigenvalues of p will be this number so

342
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,554
我们最好给这个号码命名
we better give a name to this number

343
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,924
让我们看看我打电话给那个号码W.
let's see I'm gonna call that number W

344
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:39,884
这将是我超过8的2pi
and it'll be e to the 2 pi I over 8

345
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:45,414
因为角度是2pi
right because the angle is 2 pi the

346
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,955
整个角度是2pi，除以8
whole angle is 2 pi divided it by in 8

347
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,065
所以那是2pi超过82pi
pieces so the that's 2 pi over 8 2 pi

348
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:58,495
以及四个矩阵结束
over and for a matrix of four the end by

349
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,264
结束排列是的，所以这个数字是W.
end permutation yeah so that's number W

350
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,644
当然这个家伙是平方的
and of course this guy is is w squared

351
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:17,215
这个是WQw4wv67和w8
this one is WQ w 4 w v 6 7 and w 8 is

352
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:27,595
相同1右所以右以及那些
the same as 1 right so right well those

353
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,754
我把那些数字放在那里的原因
the reason I put those numbers up there

354
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,065
是他们进入特征向量
is that they come into the eigenvectors

355
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,955
以及特征值
as well as the eigenvalues

356
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,955
它们是这八个特征值
they are the eigenvalues these eight

357
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,514
数字12345678是八
numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 are the eight

358
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,315
矩阵的特征值
eigenvalues of the matrix

359
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,144
这是一个44乘4的情况
it's a here's the 4 4 by 4 case the

360
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:52,075
矩阵是一个正交矩阵哦什么的
matrix is an orthogonal matrix Oh what

361
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,965
这会告诉我们有关特征向量的信息
does that tell us about the eigenvectors

362
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,995
正交矩阵的特征向量
the eigenvectors of an orthogonal matrix

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,245
是正交的
are orthogonal

364
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,904
就像对称矩阵一样，你也是
just like symmetric matrices so do you

365
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:15,075
知道那个小矩阵列表
know that little list of matrices with

366
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:25,825
正交特征向量如此好，我要去了
orthogonal eigenvectors so ok I'm going

367
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:31,465
称他们为Q所以QI点缀着QJ
to call them Q so Q I dotted with Q J

368
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,885
内在的产品是
the inner product is

369
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:41,865
如果我不是J，如果我会说0，则为1或01
1 or 0 1 if I would say 0 if I is not J

370
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,034
正交特征向量现在是什么
orthogonal eigenvectors now what

371
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,955
矩阵具有正交特征向量
matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors

372
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,075
我们要回到线性代数
we're going back to linear algebra

373
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,845
因为这是这就像一个
because this is this is like a

374
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,894
知道这个家庭的基本事实
fundamental fact to know this family of

375
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:58,515
奇妙的矩阵矩阵
wonderful matrices matrices with

376
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,015
正交特征向量所以告诉我一个
orthogonal eigenvectors so tell me one

377
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,654
你知道的一堆矩阵
bunch of matrices that you know has

378
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:12,265
正交特征向量对称和
orthogonal eigenvectors symmetric and

379
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,575
特征值有什么特别之处
what is special about the eigenvalues

380
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,265
他们是真实的，但还有其他的
they're real but there are other

381
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,345
具有正交的矩阵
matrices that have orthogonal

382
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,125
特征向量，我们真的应该知道
eigenvectors and we really should know

383
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,794
关于那些家伙整个故事
the whole story about those guys that

384
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,195
他们太重要了，不知道
they're too important not to know so

385
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,475
什么是另一个饥荒-一堆
what's another famine other-- bunch of

386
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,265
矩阵所以这些对称矩阵
matrices so these symmetric matrices

387
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,455
有正交特征向量和真实
have orthogonal eigenvectors and real

388
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,465
对称的，则特征值将是
symmetric then the eigenvalues will be

389
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,794
真正的其他家庭是什么其他
real well what other family what other

390
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,554
矩阵的种类是正交的
kind of matrices have orthogonal

391
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,845
特征向量但它们可能很复杂
eigenvectors but they might be complex

392
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,625
和特征值可能是复杂，所以
and the eigenvalues might be complex so

393
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,654
而你只需要你可以不知道
and you just have to you can't know

394
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,835
傅立叶没说，我可以处理
Fourier without saying ok I can deal

395
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,065
这个复杂的数字确定
with this complex number ok

396
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,255
什么是另一个矩阵族
so what's another family of matrices

397
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,164
具有正交特征向量的是
that has orthogonal eigenvectors yes

398
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:21,015
对角线肯定是正确的，然后我们知道
diagonal for sure right and then we know

399
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:29,755
我们有特征向量
that we we have the eigenvectors are go

400
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,115
到单位矩阵权呀等等
into the identity matrix right yeah so

401
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,914
我们知道对角线的一切
we know everything about diagonal ones

402
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,404
你可以说那些都包括在内
you could say those are included in

403
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,615
对称现在让我们得到一些新的
symmetric now let's get some new ones

404
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,375
还有什么
what else

405
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,225
正交矩阵计数
orthogonal matrices count

406
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,494
正交矩阵，如排列或
orthogonal matrices like permutations or

407
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:53,715
像旋转或像反射一样
like rotations or like reflections

408
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,605
正交矩阵和什么是特殊的
orthogonal matrices and what's special

409
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,325
关于它们的特征值的特征值
about their eigenvalues the eigenvalues

410
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,845
正交矩阵的大小是
of an orthogonal matrix the magnitude is

411
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,884
1确实必须有一个，因为一个
1 exactly there has to be one because an

412
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:16,705
正交矩阵不会改变
orthogonal matrix doesn't change the

413
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,784
向量q的长度x乘以
length of the vector q times x has the

414
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,335
所有向量和x的长度与x4相同
same length as x 4 for all vectors and

415
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,185
特别是对于特征向量，如果
in particular for eigenvectors so if

416
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,985
这是一个特征向量qx等于
this was an eigenvector q x would equal

417
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,524
lambdaX，现在如果等于那个
the lambda X and now if that equals that

418
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,404
那么lambda必须是1的大小
then lambda has to be 1 the magnitude of

419
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,965
lambda必须是1当然很复杂
lambda has to be 1 of course complex

420
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,095
预计这里会有数字
numbers are expected here and that's

421
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,914
正是我们在这里看到的一切
exactly what we're seeing here all the

422
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,815
排列的特征值非常大
eigenvalues of permutations are very

423
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,634
特殊的正​​交矩阵II不会
special orthogonal matrices I I won't

424
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:59,575
将排列分别添加到列表中
add permutations separately to the list

425
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:08,034
但他们现在算是这样的了
but they count now what so this has the

426
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,124
事实上，这是在名单上告诉我们的
fact that this is on the list tells us

427
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:12,624
我们要去的特征向量
that the eigenvectors that we're going

428
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:15,114
找到正交我们没有
to find are orthogonal we don't have to

429
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,244
做一个单独的检查，看看他们是谁
do a separate check to see that they are

430
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:20,654
一旦我们计算出它们就必须存在
once we compute them they have to be

431
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,215
还有的特征向量我们
there are the eigenvectors of our

432
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,654
正交矩阵现在我可以问你
orthogonal matrix now I could ask you

433
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,904
让我们保持这个打算得到整个
let's keep going with this get the whole

434
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:35,095
列出这里以及对称的那些
list here along with symmetric there's

435
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,804
另一堆人反对称大
another bunch of guys anti-symmetric big

436
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,174
对付，但这些都是重要的，所以
deal but those are important so

437
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,914
对称意味着转置等于a
symmetric means a transpose equals a

438
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,975
对角线你知道转置等于a
diagonal you know a transpose equals a

439
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,475
反正交矩阵现在我
inverse orthogonal matrices now I'm

440
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,355
打算放入反对称矩阵
going to put in anti-symmetric matrices

441
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,225
哪里
where

442
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:06,145
转置是减去你的想法
a transpose is minus a what do you think

443
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,465
你知道的特征值
you know about the eigenvalues for

444
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,365
反对称矩阵
anti-symmetric matrices

445
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,905
我们举一个反对称的例子
shall we take an example anti-symmetric

446
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:25,545
矩阵说零一个零和负一
matrix say zero zero one and minus one

447
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,545
什么是好，如果那特征值
what are the eigenvalues of that well if

448
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,965
我减去拉姆达从从
I subtract lambda from the from the

449
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,175
对角线并采取确定的我得到
diagonal and takes a determinate I get

450
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:43,585
lambda平方加1右等于0所以
lambda squared plus 1 right equals 0 so

451
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:51,595
lambda是我或者我是旋转
lambda is I or minus I that's a rotation

452
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,535
矩阵本身是啊
matrix itself yeah

453
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,595
是的，它是一个90度的旋转
yeah it's a it's a rotation through 90

454
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,335
度，所以不可能是真实的
degrees so there could not be a real

455
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,705
特征值你有没有想过这个
eigenvalue have you thought about that

456
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,835
或者如果我每次都旋转一个真正的特征向量
or a real eigenvector if i rotate every

457
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,835
矢量怎么可能出来一个矢量
vector how could a vector come out a

458
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,075
我自己怎么样才能拥有一个
multiple of itself how could I have a

459
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,105
转置时间等于lambda的向量
transpose times a vector equal lambda

460
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,255
我已经旋转它的矢量时代了
times a vector I've rotated it and yet

461
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,655
不知何故，它在同一个方向
it's in the same direction well somehow

462
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,165
这可能是想象中的
that's possible in imaginary in in

463
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,925
虚构的空间，并非不可能
imaginary space and not not possible in

464
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:38,485
真实的空间好吧所以这里是一个lambdas
real space okay so so here's a lambdas

465
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:45,415
是虚构的，现在终于告诉我了
are imaginary and now finally tell me

466
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,755
如果你知道整个的名字，你
you if you know the name of the whole

467
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,975
包括所有矩阵的矩阵族
family of matrices that includes all of

468
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,535
那些和更多的矩阵
those and more of matrices with

469
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,935
正交向量所以那是什么
orthogonal eigenvectors so what is that

470
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,115
那么什么是特殊属性
what are the special properties then

471
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,215
这些将是矩阵，所以我称之为M
these would be matrices so I call them M

472
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,085
对于矩阵，所以它是一个正交的
for matrix so it's a has orthogonal

473
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,695
你是矢量所以它是Q倍
you're vector so it's a Q times the

474
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,745
对角线时间q转置得很好
diagonal times q transpose that's well

475
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,965
我真的写下来了
I've really written down somehow I

476
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,945
没有为他们写下名字但是
haven't written a name down for them but

477
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,205
这就是他们获得他们的方式我是
that's the way they way to get them I'm

478
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:35,174
允许任何正交的特征向量
allowing any orthogonal eigenvectors

479
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,515
对不起，这是对角线我对角线
sorry this is diagonal I've diagonalized

480
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,715
矩阵，在这里，我得到任何
the the matrix and here the I get any

481
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,135
特征值所以我想要最后一个人
eigenvalue so I want to the final guy on

482
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,705
此列表允许任何特征值
this list allows any eigenvalues any

483
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,424
复杂的数字，但我可以矢量
complex numbers but there I can vectors

484
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:56,215
我想要正交
I'm want to be orthogonal

485
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,735
所以这就是为什么我将q怎么这么会
so that's why I have the Q so how would

486
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,284
你认识到这样一个矩阵，是什么
you recognize such a matrix and what is

487
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,705
他们的名字，这样是那么这
the name for them so that is so this

488
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,125
我们可能会超过1806年
we're going beyond 1806 because probably

489
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,544
我没有提到这个名字的名字
I don't mention that name the name for

490
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:19,515
这些矩阵在1806年，但我可以和
these matrices in 1806 but I could and

491
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,765
任何人都知道这种形式的矩阵是
anybody know it a matrix of that form is

492
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:31,794
正常矩阵法线就是这样
a normal matrix normal so that's the

493
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:41,035
总列表是正常名称
total list is a normal name

494
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:48,095
所以正常的矩阵看起来就像我有的那样
so normal matrices look like that I have

495
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,135
为那些想到这一点的人道歉
to apologize for whoever thought up that

496
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,555
名字正常我的意思是那样的好
name normal I mean like that's like okay

497
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,585
在多一点思考，你可能已经
in a little more thought you could've

498
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,495
想出更有意义的事情
come up with something more meaningful

499
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,825
不仅仅是说正常哦上帝说矩阵
than just say normal oh god says matrix

500
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,985
这与正常情况完全相反
that's the absolute opposite of normal

501
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,105
几乎所有的矩阵都不正常
almost all matrices are not normal

502
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,805
所以无论如何，这就是他们所谓的
so anyway but that's what they're called

503
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,985
正常的矩阵，最后你怎么样
normal matrices and finally how do you

504
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,435
认识每个人的正常矩阵
recognize a normal matrix everybody

505
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,385
知道如何识别对称
knows how to recognize a symmetric

506
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,265
矩阵或对角矩阵，我们甚至
matrix or a diagonal matrix and we even

507
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,945
知道如何识别正交
know how to recognize an orthogonal

508
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,205
矩阵或歪斜或反对称但如何
matrix or skew or anti-symmetric but how

509
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,275
你有什么简单的测试方法一
do you what's the quick test for a

510
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,595
普通矩阵我会告诉你
normal matrix well I'll just tell you

511
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,475
普通矩阵有m个转置m
that a normal matrix has m transpose m

512
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,865
等于mm转置我在这里说
equal m m transpose I'm talking here

513
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,055
关于真正的矩阵，我真的应该
about real matrices and I really should

514
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,765
转向复杂，但让我想到
move to complex but let me just think of

515
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,775
它们是真实的，所以如果麻烦的话
them as real so if well the trouble is

516
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,645
他们的矩阵可能是真实的，但是
they the matrices might be real but the

517
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,785
特征向量不会是真实的
eigenvectors are not going to be real

518
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,635
并且特征值不会
and the eigenvalues are not going to be

519
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,635
真正所以我真的很抱歉说真的
real so really I I'm sorry to say really

520
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:14,215
再次，我应该走出走出的
again I should get out of the out of the

521
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,995
真实的限制，我怎么得到
limitation to real yeah and how do I get

522
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,015
出于对我真实的限制
out of the limitation to real what do I

523
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,225
如果M是复数矩阵，则在此处改变
change here if M is a complex matrix

524
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,195
而不是一个真正的矩阵然后
instead of a real matrix then whenever

525
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,535
你转置它你应该采取它
you transpose it you should take its

526
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,225
复杂的共轭所以现在就是这样的
complex conjugate so now that that's the

527
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,465
真实的东西，这是正常的事情
real thing that's the normal thing

528
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,955
这是正确的事情呀右右
that's the right thing yeah right right

529
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,975
事情更好，所以这是正常的
things better okay so that's a normal

530
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,305
矩阵和你可以检查，如果你
matrix and and you can check that if you

531
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,594
拿了那个米，你想出了m
took that m and you figured out m

532
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,144
转置并做到它会起作用
transpose and did that it would work

533
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,084
因为最后队列取消了
because in the end the queues cancel and

534
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:05,145
你只有两个对角矩阵
you're just have two diagonal matrices

535
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,405
那就是那种自动的
there and that's sort of automatic that

536
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,285
对角矩阵通勤这么正常
diagonal matrices commute so a normal

537
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,895
矩阵是与其交换的矩阵
matrix is one that commutes with its

538
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,135
用它的转置或转置通勤
transpose commutes with its transpose or

539
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,104
它的共轭转置在复合体中
its conjugate transpose in the complex

540
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:26,295
案件确定为什么我这么简单地说
case ok why did I say all that simply

541
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,824
因为哦，我猜是这样的
because oh I guess that so the

542
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:39,465
置换P是正交的，所以
permutation P is is orthogonal so so

543
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,535
它的特征向量，我们要去
it's eigen vectors which we're going to

544
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,235
写下一分钟是正交的
write down in a minute are orthogonal

545
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:51,045
但实际上这个矩阵C将是一个
but actually this matrix C will be a

546
00:35:51,050 --> 00:36:00,104
正常矩阵我没有看到即将到来
normal matrix I didn't see that coming

547
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:02,255
当我开始谈论这些家伙时
as I started talking about these guys

548
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,354
是的，如果我这是一个正常的矩阵
yeah so that's a normal matrix if I

549
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,725
因为因为循环矩阵
because because circulant matrices

550
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,334
通勤任何两个循环矩阵
commute any two circulant matrices

551
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:18,405
通勤C1C2等于C2C1现在
commute C 1 C 2 equals C 2 C 1 and now

552
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,334
如果C2是转置，那么这里是a
if C 2 is the transpose of so here's a

553
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:29,195
矩阵是啊所以这些都是矩阵
matrix yeah so these are matrices here

554
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,425
循环萨尔通勤它有点
circulant Sall commute it's a little

555
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,665
当你繁殖时，矩阵族
family of matrices when you multiply

556
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,255
他们聚一聚更多的人
them together you get more of them

557
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,445
你只是呆在那个小小的地方
you're just staying in that little

558
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,695
具有n个参数的循环世界
circulant world with n parameters and

559
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,675
一旦你知道你知道的第一行
once you know the first row you know all

560
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,055
其他行，所以实际上他们都是
the other rows and so in fact they all

561
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,395
拥有相同的特征向量所以现在让我
have the same eigen vector so now let me

562
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,135
可以肯定我们得到了特征向量
that may be sure we get the eigenvectors

563
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:08,085
直接没关系
straight okay

564
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:19,525
好吧，我可以在P的载体也将是
okay I can vectors of of P will also be

565
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:29,065
我能用C的向量是因为它是一个
I can vectors of C is because it's a

566
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:43,165
P的力量组合，所以我
combination of powers of P so once I

567
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,205
找我发现P的特征向量
find the eigenvectors of P I've found

568
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,635
任何循环矩阵的特征向量
the eigenvectors of any circulant matrix

569
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,485
这些特征向量非常特殊
and these eigenvectors are very special

570
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,735
那是与傅立叶的联系
and that's the connection to fourier

571
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,215
这就是我们期望连接的原因
that's why we expect a connection to

572
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,645
傅立叶因为我们有东西
fourier because we have something

573
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,715
这是免费的
periodic and that's what free is

574
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,715
完全是好的，所以这些是什么
entirely about okay so what are these

575
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,885
特征向量
eigenvectors

576
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:21,535
让我们把p变成四乘四，好吧
let's take p to be four by four okay so

577
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,015
特征向量是我们记得的
the eigenvectors are so we remember the

578
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,385
特征值是lambda等于1lambda
eigenvalues are lambda equal 1 lambda

579
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,225
等于-1lambda等于I和lambda
equal minus 1 lambda equal I and lambda

580
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,675
等于减去我有四个特征向量
equal minus I got four eigenvectors to

581
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,735
找到，当我们找到你将拥有的那些
find and when we find those you'll have

582
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,075
一张图片好的是什么是特征值
a picture ok what's the eigenvalue

583
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,305
本征向量为等于拉姆达11111
eigenvector for a lambda equal 1 1 1 1 1

584
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,575
所以让我把它变成一个矢量和
so let me make it into a vector and the

585
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,775
lambda等于-1的特征向量是
eigenvector for lambda equal minus 1 is

586
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,535
所以我希望这种转变能够改变
so I want this shift to change every

587
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,865
如果我更好地交替那些，那么签字
sign so if I I better alternate those

588
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:06,925
标志，如果我转移它，一个人去
signs so that if I shift it the one goes

589
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,155
到-1-1到1那么本征
to the -1 -1 goes to the 1 so the eigen

590
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,705
价值是负1现在怎么样
value is minus 1 now what about the

591
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,235
特征值
eigenvalues of

592
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,185
我们很遗憾特征向量
we're sorry the eigenvector that goes

593
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:23,075
特征值我所以我想要我想要的
with eigenvalue i so i'm looking i want

594
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:29,105
如果我用一个开始它，我做的
if i start it with one and i do the

595
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,375
排列我认为我只想要我
permutation i think i just want i I

596
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,915
平方我在那里立刻，我想
squared I cubed there and I think with

597
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,095
这个减去II的人认为我想要的
this guy with minus I I think I want the

598
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,525
矢量1减去我减去我平方减去我
vector 1 minus I minus I squared minus I

599
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:57,005
立刻，所以没有停下来检查让我们
cubed so without stopping to check let's

600
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,605
只看到这里的好点
just see the the nice point here all the

601
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,595
特征向量的所有组件
all the components of eigenvectors are

602
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,855
在这张照片中我们都在这里
on in this picture all the here we've

603
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,825
得到八个特征向量一个Tigan值a
got eight eigenvectors a Tigan values a

604
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,895
特征向量具有的数字向量
digan vectors the eigenvectors have

605
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,565
8个组件和每个组件是
eight components and every component is

606
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,285
权力就是这八个数字中的一个
a power is one of these eight numbers

607
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,145
整个事情是由...构建的
the whole thing is constructed from the

608
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,395
相同的八个数字的特征值和
same eight numbers the eigenvalues and

609
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,015
特征向量和真正的关键
the eigenvectors and really the key

610
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,475
点是什么是矩阵
point is what is the matrix of

611
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,805
特征向量所以让我们写一下
eigenvectors so let's just write that

612
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:42,485
向下，所以矩阵是特征向量
down so the matrix the eigen vector

613
00:40:42,490 --> 00:41:00,025
矩阵大小为n的所有循环S--
matrix for all circulant s-- of size n

614
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,715
它们都具有相同的特征向量
they all have the same eigen vectors

615
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:11,345
包括p全部循环c
including including p all circulant c of

616
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:15,545
大小和包括大小为n的p
size and including p of size n which

617
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,235
我们就是这样的
where that's what we so what's the

618
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,095
特征向量矩阵是什么
eigenvector matrix what are the

619
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:27,715
特征向量和第一个向量
eigenvectors well the first vector

620
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:34,344
就像他们所有人一样
is all one's just as their so that's an

621
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,844
p右的特征向量因为如果我
eigenvector of p right because if I

622
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:43,735
乘以PII做一个循环移位
multiply by P I I do a shift a cyclic

623
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,255
转移，我已经拥有了下一个
shift and I've got all one's the next

624
00:41:48,260 --> 00:42:00,475
特征向量是W的权力，让我
eigenvector is powers of W and let me

625
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,425
提醒你一切都会成真
remind you everything is going to be

626
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,114
W的功率为2pi，超过N
powers of W e to the 2 pi I over N

627
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,215
这是一个复杂的数字，只有一英寸
it's that complex number that's one inch

628
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,275
圆的方式，所以这是什么
of the way round so that's C so what

629
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,185
如果我乘以P它就会发生
happens if I multiply that by P it

630
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,985
改变它，它乘以W或1
shifts it and it multiplies by W or 1

631
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,925
W双传，W传递
over W double which is W transitive

632
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,685
这是另一个特征向量好吧
which is another eigenvector okay and

633
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,445
然后这个列表中的下一个将是
then the next one in this list will be

634
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,925
好好与W平方，所以它会
well being going with W squared so it'll

635
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,035
是第四个W到第六个W到了
be W fourth W to the sixth w to the

636
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,915
第八个哇等一下，所以我得到了这些
eighth whoa wait a minute so I get these

637
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,695
排队正确告诉我你和W一起去
lined up right tell me your goes with W

638
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:50,925
哎呀
squared up whoops

639
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,625
W平方现在它是W的第四个W.
W squared now it's W the fourth W the

640
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:00,834
6W到8W第十W第12
six W to the 8 W the tenth W the twelfth

641
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:05,905
和你到第十四和你保持
and W to the fourteenth and you keep

642
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:11,965
这样就是特征本征向量
going so that's the eigen eigen vector

643
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,574
特征值1这将发生我
with eigenvalue 1 this will happen i

644
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:17,155
具有特征值，它是w或
have the eigenvalue it's either w or of

645
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,574
共轭可能是共轭条
a conjugate might be the conjugate w bar

646
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:25,195
你会看到这个矩阵，那将是什么
and you see this matrix so what would be

647
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,875
这将是W，使得最后一个图标矢量
the last icon vector it would be w so

648
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,395
这是8乘8
this is 8 by 8

649
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,794
我要呼吁的是，傅立叶矩阵
I'm gonna call that the Fourier matrix

650
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:40,764
大小为8，它是特征向量
of size eight and it's the eigenvector

651
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:49,334
矩阵等傅里叶矩阵等于
matrix so Fourier matrix equals

652
00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:59,754
特征向量矩阵所以我就是我的意思
eigenvector matrix so I'm just what I'm

653
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:02,724
说的是线性代数
saying is that the linear algebra for

654
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:07,074
这些循环S--是太棒了，他们
these circulant s-- is fantastic they

655
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,984
都具有相同的本征向量矩阵它
all have the same eigen vector matrix it

656
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:12,114
恰好是最重要的复杂因素
happens to be the most important complex

657
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,675
世界中的矩阵及其属性
matrix in the world and its properties

658
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,334
是金色的，它允许快速
are golden and it allows the fast

659
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:24,114
我们可以写的傅里叶变换
Fourier transform which we could write

660
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,895
在下一次和所有的矩阵语言
in matrix language next time and all the

661
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,804
项为W的所有条目的权力
entries are powers of W all the entries

662
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:37,254
是在单位圆上的一个
are in the on the unit circle at one of

663
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,625
那八点和最后一个人
those eight points and the last guy

664
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:42,594
将是W到第七个W到
would be W to the seventh w to the

665
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,895
第十四W¯¯二十前二十
fourteenth W the twenty first twenty

666
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,314
八点三十五分四十秒
eight thirty fifth forty seconds and

667
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:58,734
49所以W上的第四十九届会
forty nine so W of the forty-ninth would

668
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:03,024
它是最后一个平方的开始
be the last w tu7 squared it starts out

669
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:08,655
所有这些都是W到0倍0
with W to the 0 times 0 all these are

670
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:16,014
条目是你看到的图片W
the entry is yeah you see the picture W

671
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:20,935
如果W是，则xlix实际上是Wxlix
xlix what is actually W xlix if W is the

672
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,864
我们有W的第八个根
eighth root of one so we have W to the

673
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:31,344
8，它是1，因为我正在做8乘8
8th it's 1 because I'm doing 8 by 8 what

674
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:38,425
是W到49的力量它是一样的
is W to the 49th power W it's the same

675
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:44,765
好吧因为W是48是1
as W okay because W is a 48 is 1

676
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:49,695
对，我采取了这个和第六的力量
right I take the sixth power of this and

677
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,625
我得到W48说一个，所以那里有49个
I get the W 48 says one so W there 49 is

678
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:59,895
每一次都和W一样
the same as W every every ever every

679
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,995
列中矩阵的每个条目都是一个
column every entry in the matrix is a

680
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,675
W的力量，如果实际上是权力
power of W and if in fact that power is

681
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,305
只是列号乘以房间号
just column number times the room number

682
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,515
是啊
yeah

683
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,675
所以那些是好的矩阵
so those are those are the good matrices

684
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:21,915
这样就是正交矩阵
so that so that is an orthogonal matrix

685
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,055
哦，差不多它不是
oh well almost it's not it has

686
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,165
正交列，但它没有
orthogonal columns but it doesn't have

687
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,255
正交列什么是什么
orthonormal columns what's the what's

688
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,355
该列的该列的长度
the length of that column of that column

689
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:41,295
矢量平方根八右我加
vector square root of eight right I add

690
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,665
上升1平方八次，我拿走了
up 1 squared eight times and I take the

691
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,165
平方根我得到了平方根
square root I get the square root of

692
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:51,075
八，所以这真的是一个正方形
eight so so this is really it's a square

693
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:57,695
正交矩阵的八倍的根
root of eight times an orthogonal matrix

694
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,415
当然广场基地只是一个
of course the square base just a a

695
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,555
数来划分出来，使矩阵
number to divide out to make matrix to

696
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,255
使列正交而不是
make the columns orthonormal instead of

697
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,675
只是正交，但我怎么知道
just orthogonal but how do I know that

698
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,435
那些是正交的，我知道
those are orthogonal huh well I know

699
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,715
他们必须是，但我想看到它
they have to be but I'd like to see it

700
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,985
显然为什么那个矢量正交
clearly why is that vector orthogonal to

701
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:25,665
那个向量首先是他们必须的
that vector first of all they have to be

702
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,605
因为矩阵是一个普通矩阵
because the matrix is a normal matrix

703
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,645
正常矩阵有正交哦是的
normal matrices have orthogonal oh yeah

704
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,385
我怎么知道这是一个正常的矩阵哦
how do I know it's a normal matrix oh I

705
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,875
想我可以做测试，如果我有
guess I can do the test if I have

706
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,395
[掌声]
[Applause]

707
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,814
如果我有排列P我知道
if I have the permutation P I know that

708
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:50,955
P转置P等于PP转置
P transpose P equals P P transpose

709
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,195
排列通勤，所以这是正常的
permutations commute so so it's a normal

710
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,125
矩阵，但我想直接看到原因
matrix but I'd like to see directly why

711
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:02,695
是为什么是点的产品
is that why is the dot product of the

712
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,304
第一个或第零个特征向量和
first or the zeroth eigen vector and the

713
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:09,264
下一个特征向量等于零让我服用
next eigenvector equals zero let me take

714
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:12,685
点积1倍1是11倍
that dot product 1 times 1 is 1 1 times

715
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:18,375
w是w^1倍数W广场W¯¯方达
w is w 1 times W squares W squared up to

716
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,354
W到第七，我想我要去
W to the seventh I guess I'm going to

717
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:30,445
完成等于0那就是什么
finish that equals 0 well that's what's

718
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:36,175
说那些数字是真的
that saying those numbers are the are

719
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:42,744
这些是我的照片中的那些点
the are these points in my picture those

720
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:45,714
八点，所以八点
eight points so those are the eight

721
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,114
进入该列的数字
numbers that go into the that column of

722
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:53,455
那个特征向量为什么会增加
that eigen vector why do they add to

723
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,474
零你怎么看一些那些说
zero how do you see that some of those

724
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:03,774
八个数字是零是对称性
eight numbers is zero yeah the symmetry

725
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:07,734
当我添加那个人时会这样做-那个
would do it when I add that guy - that

726
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:13,135
W到零或W到8或W
guy W to the zero or W to the 8th or W

727
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,974
为零
to zero

728
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:16,974
是的，当我添加一个减去一个我得到
yeah when I add one and minus one I get

729
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:19,375
零，我有这些家伙我得零
zero and I had these guys I get zero

730
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,464
当我把这些添加成对但但是
when I add these these by pairs but but

731
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:35,455
怎么样三乘三所以三通过
what about a three by three so three by

732
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,964
三，我会去W，这将是
three I'll go to W to the this would be

733
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:44,185
e到2pi超过3然后这会
e to the 2 pi over 3 and then this would

734
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,864
是W到4PI这将是W平方
be W to the 4 PI this would be W squared

735
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:53,185
e将4PI超过3，我相信，
e to the 4 PI over 3 and I believe that

736
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:58,105
这三个向量添加到0的广告
those ads those three vectors add to 0

737
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,015
因此他们与...正交
and therefore they're orthogonal to the

738
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,885
一一一
one-one-one

739
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,465
Argan矢量因为点积
Argan vector because the dot product

740
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,145
只会保释只是想添加那些
will just bail just want to add those

741
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,755
三个数字，为什么这是真的
three numbers so why is that true

742
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,345
一加要么2PI超过3或者加
one plus either 2 PI over 3 plus either

743
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:24,355
4超过3的PI等于上课的最后一分钟
4 PI over 3 equals last minute of class

744
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,875
今天我们可以弄清楚如何做到这一点
today we can figure out how to do that

745
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,665
好吧，我可以得到一个公式
well I could get a formula for that that

746
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,355
总和是1我可以得到一个封闭的表格和
sum is 1 I could get a closed form and

747
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,755
检查我得到答案0快
check that I get the answer 0 the quick

748
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,365
可能会看到它的方式
way to see it is maybe

749
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:45,715
假设我将e乘以2pi
suppose I multiply by e to the 2 pi over

750
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,275
3所以我乘以每个词，让我们看看
3 so I multiply every term so let's see

751
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,845
2PI超过3e到4PI超过3和
the 2 PI over 3 e to the 4 PI over 3 and

752
00:50:55,850 --> 00:51:01,255
e到6PI3，好吧我该怎么办？
e to the 6 PI over 3 okay what do I

753
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,875
从中学到它是一样的因为e
learn from this it's the same because e

754
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,545
到6PI超过3是1就是那个
to the 6 PI over 3 is is 1 that's that's

755
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,995
2pi我是1，所以我也一样
2 pi I so that's 1 so I got the same

756
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,845
有人加上这个加上这个加号
someone Plus this Plus this this Plus

757
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,965
这加一，所以我得到了相同的金额
this plus one so I got the same sum when

758
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:25,375
我乘以那个数和那个总和
I multiplied by that number and that sum

759
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,065
必须是0我不能得到相同的总和我
has to be 0 I can't get the same sum I

760
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,945
不能乘以此并获得相同
can't multiply by this and get the same

761
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:35,815
回答，除非我乘以0这样
answer unless I'm multiplying 0 so that

762
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,435
告诉我，那也是奇怪的
shows me that that that also in the odd

763
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,035
当n是奇数我也有那些n
when n is odd I also have that those n

764
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,125
数字加到0确定那些是
numbers adding to 0 ok that's those are

765
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:51,685
基本的美丽画面
the basic the beautiful picture of the

766
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,885
特征值是特征向量
eigen values the eigen vectors being

767
00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:00,115
正交然后是实际的细节
orthogonal and then the actual details

768
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,735
这些特征向量是好的
here of what those eigen vectors are ok

769
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,755
好，我希望你有一个好的周末，
good I hope you have a good weekend and

770
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,104
所以我们只有一个半星期
so we've just got a week and a half

771
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:15,635
第一类的左边可能有一个
left of class I may probably have one

772
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,524
关于傅立叶，然后再做更多的事情
more thing to do about Fourier and then

773
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:21,034
我们会回到其他主题但是问一下
we'll come back to other topics but ask

774
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,754
任何问题和你的话题
any questions and that you'd topics that

775
00:52:24,759 --> 00:52:26,975
你想看到这里包括哪里
you'd like to see included here where

776
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,380
we're closing out 1806 five while you

777
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:36,210
我们现在要关门了18065，而你

778
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:36,210
伙计们做项目好吗谢谢
guys do the projects okay thank you
