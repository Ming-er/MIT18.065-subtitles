00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,695
所以我们真的在进行这次审查
so we're really moving along this review

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,614
线性代数和。的亮点
of highlights of linear algebra and

11
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,635
今天它的矩阵问他们得到了这个名字
today it's matrices Q they get that name

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,565
在那里，他们有正交列等等
there they have orthonormal columns so

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,545
这是一个人的样子，然后是
that's what one looks like and then the

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,595
关键事实正交列翻译
key fact orthonormal columns translates

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,635
直接进入你这个简单的事实
directly into that simple fact that you

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,765
每次看到都要记住
just keep remembering every time you see

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,045
Q转置Q你有自己的身份
Q transpose Q you've got the identity

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,915
矩阵让我们看看为什么Q转置
matrix let's just see why so Q transpose

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,935
我会把那些专栏和
would be I'll take those columns and

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,795
把它们分成几行，然后我成倍增加
make them into rows and then I multiply

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,965
通过Q与列，我得到了什么
by Q with the columns and what do I get

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:17,675
也希望我得到的单位矩阵
well hopefully I get the identity matrix

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,915
好的
okay

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,544
为什么因为哦是的正常部分
why because oh yeah the normal part

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,095
告诉我每个载体的长度
tells me that the lengths of each vector

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,425
这就是长度平方Q转置Q.
that's the length squared Q transpose Q

27
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,355
长度的平方是1，所以给了我
the length squared is 1 so that gives me

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,805
沿着身份矩阵中的1
the 1 in the identity matrix along the

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,745
对角然后Q转置时间a
diagonal and then Q transpose times a

30
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,375
不同的Q是0，这是正交部分
different Q is 0 that's the ortho part

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,095
所以这给了我零，所以这是一个
so that gives me the zeros so that's a

32
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,745
简单的身份，但它翻译成一个
simple identity but it translates from a

33
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,845
很多单词变成了简单的表达
lot of words into a simple expression

34
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,745
现在这意味着在另一个
now does that mean that in the other

35
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,254
订购QQ转置就是那个身份
order Q Q transpose is that the identity

36
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,015
这使对想到一个问题
that's so that's a question to think

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,145
关于QQ转置等于身份
about is QQ transpose equal the identity

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,275
题
question

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,095
有时是有时候不容易说出来
sometimes yes sometimes no easy to tell

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,745
答案是肯定的，当Q是
which the answer is yes yes when Q is

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:29,385
如果Q是a，则答案是肯定的
square the answer is yes if Q is a

42
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,045
方阵矩阵这是方阵
square matrix a square matrix a this is

43
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,335
说方阵Q有这个
saying that the square matrix Q has that

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,485
左边是倒数，但是是正方形
inverse on its left but for square

45
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,635
矩阵左逆Q转置是
matrices a left inverse Q transpose is

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,454
对于正方形也是正确的反转
also a right inverse so for a square

47
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,345
矩阵如果你有工作的逆
matrix if you have an inverse that works

48
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,905
一方面它将在另一方面工作
on one side it will work on the other

49
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,505
那边答案是肯定的
side so the answer is yes in that case

50
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,625
然后在那种情况下就是这种情况
and then in that case that's the case

51
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,965
当我们打电话给Q时我们真的没有
when we call Q is well we really don't

52
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,704
知道正确的名字是什么但是
know what the right name would be but

53
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,015
这是每个人都使用的名字
here's the name everybody uses an

54
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:15,704
正交矩阵，这是唯一的
orthogonal matrix and that's that's only

55
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:23,325
在他们的方形案例广场这里是一个
in their square case square here is an

56
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,085
正交矩阵右边你-
orthogonal matrix right right do you -

57
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,885
你想看一个例子吗？
do you want to just see an example of

58
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:33,405
如何工作，如果Q，它将不会如此
how that works and it will not so if Q

59
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,145
是矩形让我做一个
is rectangular let's let me do a

60
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:51,785
矩形Q和方形Q好方形
rectangular Q and square Q okay square

61
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,115
没事高兴看到一些正交
all right good to see some orthogonal

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,855
矩阵，因为我的信息就是这样
matrices because my message is that

63
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,895
它们在各种方面都非常重要
they're really important in all kinds of

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,715
应用程序让我从2开始
applications let's start two-by-two I

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,495
可以想到两种不同的方式
can think of two different ways to get

66
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,454
一个2乘2的正交矩阵
an orthogonal matrix that's a 2 by 2

67
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,405
矩阵，其中一个你会知道
matrix and one of them you will know

68
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,995
马上就是thethesinetheta所以
immediately cos theta sine theta so

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,175
这是一个单位向量，它是标准化的cos
that's a unit vector it's normalized cos

70
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,965
平方加正弦平方是1和这个
squared plus sine squared is 1 and this

71
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,134
人必须是垂直于它
guy has to be orthogonal to it

72
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,164
所以我做了-正弦theta和cos
so I make that - sine theta and cos

73
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,124
theta没关系
theta okay

74
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,134
那些都是他们的链接
those are both links one they're

75
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,684
正交然后这是我的Q和
orthogonal then this is my Q and the

76
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,015
如果我，Q的倒数将是转置
inverse of Q will be the transpose if I

77
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,025
乘以转置会把
multiply the transpose would put the

78
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,485
减号在这里生产
minus sign down here and would produce

79
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,985
逆矩阵是什么
the inverse matrix and what is that

80
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,795
特定的矩阵表示为什么这样做
particular matrix represent whoa why do

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,714
从几何上看，为什么我们在哪里看到
geometrically why do we where do we see

82
00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:01,434
这个矩阵是轮换的，谢谢你
that matrix it's a rotation thank you

83
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,865
这是整个飞机的旋转
it's a rotation of the whole plane by

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,615
SATA
SATA

85
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,245
是的，如果我将其应用于零
yeah so so if I apply that to one zero

86
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,605
例如，我得到第一列
for example I get the first column which

87
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,355
是因为thetasinetheta，那就是
is cos theta sine theta and that's just

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,555
一根绳子让我画出一幅矢量图片
a rope let me draw a picture that vector

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,024
10已经向上旋转-所以有
1 0 has got rotated up - so there's the

90
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:29,064
10在那里它旋转了
the 1 0 and there it got rotated through

91
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,724
角度θ和类似的01将
an angle theta and similarly 0 1 will

92
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,724
旋转角度θ2
get rotated through an angle theta 2

93
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:40,555
那么整架飞机都旋转哦
there so the whole plane rotates oh that

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,314
让我记住一个非常重要的事情
makes me remember a highly important

95
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,594
Q的一个非常重要的属性它没有
very important property of Q it doesn't

96
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,474
改变长度任何向量的长度
change length the length of any vector

97
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,314
旋转后它是一样的
is the same after you rotate it the

98
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,714
任何矢量的长度都是相同的
length of any vector is the same after

99
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,265
你乘以Q我可以做到这一点
you multiply by Q can I just do that

100
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,724
我声称任何X想要的任何X
I claim any X any vector X I want to

101
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,414
看看QX的长度，我声称
look at the length of Q X and I claim

102
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,714
它与X的长度相同
that it has the same length as X

103
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,564
实际上这就是原因
actually that's the reason in

104
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:18,115
正交矩阵的计算
computations that orthogonal matrix are

105
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,254
如此受欢迎，因为没有溢出可以
so much loved because no overflow can

106
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,194
发生在正交矩阵长度上
happen with orthogonal matrices lengths

107
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,145
不要改变我可以乘以任何
don't change I can multiply by any

108
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,235
正交矩阵的数量和
number of orthogonal matrices and the

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,985
长度不变，我们可以看到原因
lengths don't change can we just see why

110
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,555
那是真的你怎么样我们呢？
that's true how would you so what do we

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,055
必须继续我们
have to go on we

112
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,395
我们要做的是Q转置Q.
what we have to go on is Q transpose Q

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,175
等我每当我们要证明它的时候
equal I whenever we're gonna prove it's

114
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,885
得出来的，由于这是
got to come out of that because that's

115
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,135
所有我们都知道，所以如何使用它来获得
all we know so how do I use that to get

116
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,025
那
that

117
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,105
好吧，我们还没有说很多
well we haven't said a whole lot about

118
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,835
长度，但你现在看到的这一切，它会
lengths but you'll see it all now it'll

119
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,755
更容易证明正方形
be easier to prove that the squares are

120
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,655
同样如此，什么是矩阵
the same so what's the what's the matrix

121
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,575
表达式的长度平方是什么的
expression for the length squared what's

122
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,895
什么是右边的那一面
what's the right-hand side of that

123
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,965
等式X转置X右X转置
equation X transpose X right X transpose

124
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,275
X给出了正方形的总和
X gives me the sum of the squares

125
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,495
毕达哥拉斯说这是长度
Pythagoras says that's the length

126
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,315
平方，使右手边是X.
squared so that right hand side is X

127
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,605
转置X什么是左侧
transpose X what's the left side

128
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,915
这是QX的长度平方所以
it's a length squared of this of QX so

129
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,725
它必须与hueX转置相同
it must be the same as hue X transpose

130
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,555
QX和声称是那个等式
QX and the claim is that that equation

131
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,535
抱着，你看到了吗？
holds and do you see it

132
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,405
如果来自Q，那么任何财产都在哪里
whereís so any property if from Q is

133
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,565
将有干脆直接走出来
going to has to just come out directly

134
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,315
从那里我只是在这里
from that where is it here do I just

135
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,435
喜欢在那个左边推开一点点
like push away a little bit at that left

136
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,465
手边看到它
hand side and see it

137
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,925
QX转置与X转置相同
QX transpose is the same as X transpose

138
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:04,315
Q转置和QX是QX，现在我
Q transpose and QX is QX and now I'm

139
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,105
眼看还有你可能会说等一下
seeing well you might say wait a minute

140
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,775
括号在那里，但在那里
the parentheses were there and there but

141
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,295
我说矩阵最重要的法则
I say the most important law for matrix

142
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,095
乘法是你可以移动
multiplication is you can move

143
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,585
括号或扔掉它们让我们
parentheses or throw them away let's

144
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,795
在这里漫游所以我在看Q
roam away so in here I'm seeing Q

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,815
转置Q这是什么身份
transpose Q which is the identity so

146
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,415
这是这是真的耶，这样意味着，
it's it's true yeah so that means that

147
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,965
你永远不会下溢或溢出
you're never underflow or overflow when

148
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,885
你将每个数字乘以Q.
you're multiplying by Q every numerical

149
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,975
算法编写使用正交
algorithm is written to use orthogonal

150
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,845
矩阵，如果可以的话，可以和
matrices if wherever it can can okay and

151
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:48,665
这是第一个例子
here's the first example

152
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,355
我想对我来说可能有好处
I think maybe good for me to think of

153
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,274
其他例子或我们想到的
other examples or for us to think of

154
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,805
正交矩阵的其他例子也是如此
other examples of orthogonal matrices so

155
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,445
我正在使用那个词正交矩阵I.
I'm using that word orthogonal matrix I

156
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,084
应该真的应该真的
should it really should we should really

157
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,935
说正统，我真的
be saying orthonormal and I'm really

158
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,655
主要考虑方形的，所以
thinking mostly of square ones so so the

159
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,514
所以在Q转置时的方形情况下
so in the square case when Q transpose

160
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,545
当然Q逆这一事实使得
is Q inverse of course that fact makes

161
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,545
很容易地解决都方程
it easy to solve all equations that have

162
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,965
Q因为你是一个系数矩阵
Q as a coefficient matrix because you

163
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,454
想要逆，你只需要使用
want the inverse and you just use the

164
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:37,324
转置好吧让我们来看看吧
transpose okay let's just take a some

165
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:40,475
几分钟想起Q的，如果实例
minutes to think of examples of Q's if

166
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,745
它们必须如此重要
they're so important there have to be

167
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,185
有趣的例子，那是一个
interesting examples and that was a

168
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,045
第一个现在还有一个
first one now there's one more

169
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,255
我是你的两个二个例子
two-by-two example that I that you

170
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,954
应该知道你知道那会是什么
should know do you know what that would

171
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,435
是
be

172
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,675
所以另一个这将是例子二和
so another this will be example two and

173
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,194
它也将只有两个两个
it's also going to be only two by two

174
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:04,385
真实的，我有什么可能性
and real and what possibility have I got

175
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,065
离开这里我将使用相同的第一列
left here I'll use the same first column

176
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,035
costhetasinetheta因为那更多
cos theta sine theta because that's more

177
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,685
或者更少的任何单位向量
or less any any unit vector in two

178
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,135
尺寸已经形成了这种形式
dimensions this has got that form so

179
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,595
你对第二个提出了什么建议？
what do you propose for the second

180
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,415
柱
column

181
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:32,105
是的是把减号放下来
yes yeah put the put the minus sign down

182
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,655
在这里，你认为这样做
here so you think does that make any

183
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,255
差异所以正弦θ和负cos
difference so sine theta and minus cos

184
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,185
theta我不知道你是否曾经看过
theta I don't know if you've ever looked

185
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,725
在那个矩阵你知道我们正在努力
at that matrix you know we're trying to

186
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,975
收集在一起几个矩阵
collect together a few matrices that are

187
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,944
值得了解的是值得看的好
worth knowing are worth looking at okay

188
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,655
现在发生了什么样的事情
now what kind of what's happened here

189
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,834
你可能会说这是一个微不足道的变化
you may say that was a trivial change

190
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,845
它有点像但它是一个
which it kind of was but it's a

191
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,274
不同的矩阵现在不是轮换
different matrix now it's not a rotation

192
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,995
再
anymore

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,495
那不是死记硬背
that's not a rote

194
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,575
是的，现在它是对称的
and yeah somehow now it's symmetric and

195
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,345
[音乐]
[Music]

196
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,465
是的，它的特征向量必须是什么
yeah what its eigenvectors must be

197
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,615
某些东西或其他我们会得到那些
something or other we'll get to those

198
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,345
但是那个矩阵做了什么呢？
but what did what does that matrix do I

199
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,755
不知道我不知道你是否见过
don't know I don't know if you've seen

200
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,835
它，如果你没有它不是它没有
it if you haven't it's not it doesn't

201
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,255
跳出但它是一个重要的情况下，该
jump out but it's a important case this

202
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:40,325
它是一个反射矩阵通知
is a reflection matrix notice that it's

203
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,265
确定它是负1你有减去
determined it is minus 1 you have minus

204
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,155
cos平方θ减去正弦平方
cos squared theta minus sine squared

205
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,105
theta确定的是-1
theta it's determinate is minus 1

206
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,675
它有一些特征值
there's some some some eigenvalue it

207
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,275
得出那个有-是的
coming up with that that's got a - yeah

208
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,045
好的，我的意思是反思
ok so what do I mean by a reflection

209
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,615
矩阵让我画飞机，我想
matrix let me draw the plane and I think

210
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,655
所以10让我们再跟着它1
so so 1 0 let's follow it follow again 1

211
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,125
0去哪儿了
0 where does that go

212
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,195
这给了我第一列
that gives me the first column so as

213
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,115
在它去costheta正弦theta之前
before it goes to cos theta sine theta

214
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,165
当我说反思让我放
and when I say reflection let me put put

215
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,895
镜子进入图片所以你
the the mirror into the picture so you

216
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,685
看看镜子的反射是什么
see what reflection it is the mirror is

217
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,505
在这里角度命运/-留下来
is along here at angle fate / - stayed

218
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:42,035
过度生活，确保足够的角度
over to live so sure enough 1 0 at angle

219
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,125
0被反射到单位向量中
0 got reflected into a unit vector at

220
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,675
角θ和中间是
angle theta and halfway between was the

221
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,435
saitovirtuline就是那个
saito virtu line that's that's not

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,035
现在没关系，另一个人呢
that's okay now what about the other guy

223
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,735
01
0 1

224
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,265
这是01好的我可以乘以
here's 0 1 ok I multiply that can I put

225
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,935
01在这里，所以你只是你的眼睛
the 0 1 up here so you just your eye

226
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,995
乘法在哪里
does the multiplication where is the

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,355
01的结果是什么输出
result of 0 1 what's the output from

228
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,244
从提示适用于零正弦theta
from cue applied to zero one sine theta

229
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,794
减去COSTHETA右它的它的
minus cos theta right it's the it's the

230
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,514
第二列，那就是那个
second column and so where is that

231
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,674
好吧，它与那个人垂直
well it's perpendicular to that guy

232
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,524
这是正确的我正确的，是知道
that's right I know right that was the

233
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,415
指出两列是
point that the two columns are

234
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,785
垂直，所以它必须下降
perpendicular so it's so it must go down

235
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,304
这样的权利正弦余弦THETAtheta和
this way right sine theta cos theta and

236
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:44,215
它并没有改变所有这些长度
it doesn't change lengths all these

237
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,814
我们刚刚学到的事实是关键所在
facts that we just learned are key so

238
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:53,274
有一个是零，它去了
there's there's zero one and it goes to

239
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,514
这家伙是什么那第二
this guy which is whatever that second

240
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:03,504
列是正弦theta减去costheta和
column is sine theta minus cos theta and

241
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,574
如果你检查它实际上像普通的
if you check that actually like plain

242
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,355
几何我相信从未发生过
geometry I believe never occurred to me

243
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,074
之前，但我相信这一点
before but I believe it that that this

244
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,374
那个角度下降到那里
angle going down to there that that goes

245
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:21,704
直通，中途
straight through and that the halfway

246
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:27,834
一个是那条线是的，我认为
one is that line yeah I think that

247
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,405
图片得到它，我认为它在
picture is got it and I think it's in

248
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,424
这个音符就是一个反射矩阵
the note so that's a reflection matrix

249
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:37,254
那是一个二乘二的反思
well that's a two-by-two reflection

250
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,914
你希望看到其他的矩阵吗？
matrix would you like to see some other

251
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,095
像这样的矩阵但是更大
matrices like this one but but larger

252
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,144
他们以一个名叫的人命名
they're named after a guy named

253
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:56,444
住户所以这些都是户主
householder so these are householder

254
00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:03,655
反思我在做什么我在这里
reflections what am I doing here I'm

255
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,504
收集一些正交
collecting together some orthogonal

256
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,785
有用且重要的矩阵
matrices that are useful and important

257
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,394
和住户发现了一大堆
and householder found a whole bunch of

258
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,054
他们和他的算法很多
them and and his algorithm is a much

259
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,444
数值线性代数的用过那一部分，从而
used part of numerical linear algebra so

260
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,074
他从一个单位向量开始
he started with a unit vector start with

261
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,905
单位向量
a unit vector

262
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,894
你将你的转置等于1，那么它的长度
you transpose u equal 1 so the length of

263
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,715
向量是1，然后他创建
the vector is 1 and then he created

264
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,074
让我把它命名为他创造的他
let's name it after him H he created

265
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,314
这个矩阵的身份减2uu
this matrix the identity minus 2 uu

266
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:48,355
转置，我相信这是一个
transpose and I believe that that's a

267
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,345
非常有用的矩阵所以就像我一样
really useful matrix so it's just like I

268
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,824
认为这篇评论就像是超越了
think this review is like going beyond

269
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:02,254
1806进入什么是真正的
1806 into what is what ones are really

270
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,595
值得知道，值得了解
worth knowing that worth knowing

271
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,225
单独确定我们可以检查一下
individually ok could we just check what

272
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,134
是持有人的财产
are the properties of house holders

273
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,564
我的反思-对你而言
reflection of that I - to you you

274
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:17,824
在这里识别列时间如此
recognize here column times a row so

275
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:21,004
这是一个矩阵，是什么样的
that's a matrix and what kind of what

276
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,735
你能告诉我有关矩阵UU
could you tell me about that matrix u u

277
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:34,115
转移它是啊所以呃或什么
transpose it's yeah so uh or what what

278
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,184
我们可以谈谈关于H的事情吗？
can we say about about about H so I

279
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:42,574
我猜我相信H是一个
guess I'm believing that H is a

280
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,245
正交矩阵否则就不会
orthogonal matrix otherwise it wouldn't

281
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,905
今天在这里
be here today

282
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,095
所以我相信，那不仅是
so I believe that and that not only is

283
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,115
它正交它也有一个看
it orthogonal it is also have a look at

284
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,535
它对称它也是对称的
it symmetric it's also symmetric the

285
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,415
身份对称的uu转置是
identity symmetric uu transpose is

286
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,934
对称的，因此，这是一个家庭
symmetric so that this is a family of

287
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,634
对称正交矩阵和那个
symmetric orthogonal matrices and that

288
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,025
是其中一个是对称的
was one of them that's a symmetric

289
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,395
正交矩阵这些矩阵是
orthogonal matrix these matrices are

290
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,174
真的很高兴你喜欢进去
really great to have you just like in in

291
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:17,944
使用线性代数，你得到一个
using linear algebra it's you just get a

292
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,735
有用的矩阵的集合，您
collection of useful matrices that you

293
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,954
可以调用这些肯定是一个
can call on and these are definitely one

294
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,265
家庭，它显然是对称的
family well it's obviously symmetric

295
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,145
我们应该检查它是否正交
shall we check that it's orthogonal so

296
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,275
检查它是否正交我就是这样
to check that it's orthogonal I just so

297
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,745
我要检查H转置H是什么
I'm going to check that H transpose H is

298
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,445
这个身份我可以检查一下
the identity can I just check that

299
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,485
H转置与H相同
well H transpose is the same as H

300
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,285
因为它是对称的所以我会
because it was symmetric so I'm gonna

301
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,885
这个家伙，这真的是H次H
square this guy this is really H times H

302
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,365
我正在调整它，如果我，我会得到什么
I'm squaring it and what do I get if I

303
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,565
广场所以我得到了我希望我得到了
square so so I get I hope I get the

304
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,135
身份，但让我们看看它得到了什么
identity but let's see it what do I get

305
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,835
当我加上这个时，这就变得很少了
when I Square this get little multiply

306
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,435
出来
it out

307
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,205
所以，我是我，然后我得到一些
so I times I is I and then I get some

308
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,085
uu的数量转置这个有多少
number of uu transpose this how many do

309
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,345
我从那里得到了所以我正在摆平
I get for that from that so I'm squaring

310
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,925
这件事因为H转置H是
this thing because H transpose H is the

311
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,465
同样以H倍h后，我现蕾这么
same as H times H so I'm squaring it so

312
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,005
有多少我要放在这里谢谢
how many what do I put here for thanks

313
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,095
而现在我已经把这个家伙搞平了
and now I've got this guy squared with a

314
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,625
加上这样四个uu转置uu
plus so that's four uu transpose uu

315
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,745
颠倒
transpose

316
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,185
是的，我完全意识到我
yeah I'm totally realizing I've

317
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,305
一辈子练习这些
practiced for a lifetime doing these

318
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,125
很少的计算，但他们是
dinky little calculations but they are

319
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,665
晕，你会得到它的悬念
dinky and you'll get the hang of it

320
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,125
我现在很快就希望得到什么
quickly now what am i hoping out of that

321
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,885
底线是我希望你能得到的
bottom line that it is I hope you to get

322
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,575
我知道我是，我们是谁看到了如何
I do we get I yes we're who sees how to

323
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,955
从那件事情中醒来，是的
get eye out of that thing yeah u

324
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,455
在这里转置你是一个数字
transpose u in here is a number that was

325
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,795
你是列时间行的时间
you that was column times row times

326
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,785
列时间排，我看着
column times row and I look at the in

327
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,005
这里的中间是Rho时间列和
the middle here is Rho times column and

328
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,795
这是第一，因为它是
that's the number one right because it's

329
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,365
那就是那个，然后我有
there so that's one and then I have

330
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,525
减去其中的四个加上四个
minus four of that plus four of that

331
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,775
他们互相取消，我就是这样
they cancel each other and I get I so

332
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,505
这些是我们将使用的好矩阵
those are good matrices we'll we'll use

333
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,855
他们实际上他们会使用它们
them we'll use them actually they're

334
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,985
比克施密特好，所以我们会用
better than gram-schmidt so we'll use

335
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,355
他们在使事物正交
them in in making things orthogonal

336
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,105
那么什么是其他正交矩阵
so what what other orthogonal matrices

337
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,805
让我们创造一些你知道的创造
let's create some you know creating

338
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,685
你知道Gordo正交矩阵
Gordo orthogonal matrices is you know

339
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:15,525
这是付出总有回报，让我们觉得这样有
it's it pays off let's think so there's

340
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:22,875
一个以这个法国人命名的家庭
a family named after this French guy who

341
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,635
活到一百岁他是一个真正的老人
lived to a hundred he was a real old

342
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,915
计时器
timer

343
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,155
麻省理工学院有一名数学教师
well MIT had a faculty member in math

344
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,185
当我来到教授罢工的时候
when I came professor strike who lived

345
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,825
到了一百零六，我听到了他的声音
to a hundred and six and I heard him

346
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,525
在布朗大学做演讲
give a lecture at Brown University at

347
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,015
100岁，这就像是完美的你
age 100 and it was like perfect you

348
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,595
不能做的更好，所以他是我的
could not have done it better so he's my

349
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,355
灵感我继续前进我只有
inspiration I'm keep going I only have

350
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,005
再多10年才能到达那里
like 10 more years to get there well

351
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,335
这是太多反正没事亚当重新所有
it's too many anyway okay Adam re all

352
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,415
对
right

353
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,805
所以他创作的亚当艺术很好
so Adam art he created well that's the

354
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:08,355
最简单的是现在最小的下一个人
simplest the smallest now the next guy

355
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,725
我会去四点四
is gonna be four by four I'm going to

356
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,115
把它放在我看到的那个我要去的地方
put that so where I see a one I'm gonna

357
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:21,705
把Adamartis111减去1111减去
put Adam artis 1 1 1 minus 1 1 1 1 minus

358
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,405
1然后当我看到减去我要去的时候
1 and then when I see a minus I'm gonna

359
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,625
把它放在一个减号
put it in with a minus

360
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,495
你看到那张照片是一张照片
you saw that picture it was a picture of

361
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,795
H2H2h2和负H2就是这样
H 2 H 2 h 2 and minus H 2 that's what

362
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,505
我到了那里，我相信那些
I've got there and I believe those

363
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:52,545
列是正交的，现在是什么
columns are orthogonal right now what

364
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,505
我可以吗
could I do

365
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,425
好吧，它不是一个正交矩阵
well it's not quite an orthogonal matrix

366
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,205
我该怎么办才能做到这一点
what do I have to do to make this isn't

367
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,305
什么是相当正交的矩阵
quite an orthogonal matrix either what

368
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,165
我该怎么做才能使这个正交
what do I do to make that an orthogonal

369
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,955
矩阵/
matrix /

370
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,924
两个平方根我需要我需要单位
square root of two I need I need unit

371
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:17,024
矢量那里和那里的长度是
vectors there and here those lengths are

372
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:19,784
1平方1平方4平方根4
1 squared 1 squared 4 square root of 4

373
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,544
是2所以我最好除以2那里
is 2 so I better divided by the 2 there

374
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,845
而现在我在这里，我会在这里
and now here I'm gonna here I'm up to

375
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,384
是的，那就是那个人不告诉我
yeah so that was that one don't tell me

376
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,935
接下来一起来那是什么将是
the next one up what's that going to be

377
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:38,284
8比8是什么，所以这就是H4
8 by 8 what's that so this is H 4 here

378
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:44,054
哎呀4告诉我应该做些什么48
oops 4 so tell me what I should do 4 8

379
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,695
到8，你会觉得这很简单
by 8 you'll think this is like simple

380
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,215
但这是一件好事
but that's that's a good thing to say

381
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,715
关于它，你知道他们正在编码
about it you know they're in encoding

382
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,695
理论你想要的各种各样的地方
theory all sorts of places you want

383
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,485
一个和一个的矩阵
matrices of ones and minus ones

384
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,835
好吧什么是H8我要用它来构建它
ok what's H 8 I'm gonna build it out of

385
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,345
H4所以我会怎么样
H 4 so what am I gonna what's it going

386
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,735
是我要把一个H的有什么
to be I'm gonna put an H for there what

387
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,514
我要把另外的H4放在这里
am I going to put here another H 4 and

388
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,935
在这里另一个H4，最后在这里
up here another H 4 and finally here

389
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,764
减去H和我想我已经得到了正交
minus H and I think I've got orthogonal

390
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:30,644
列再次正确因为
columns again right because the the

391
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:34,424
这些点产品中的列与
columns within these dot products with

392
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:39,105
他们自己给0和0点产品
themselves give 0 and 0 the dot products

393
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,495
从这些列和这些列
from these columns and these columns

394
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,384
显然有减号和点
obviously have the minus and the dot

395
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,955
这里的产品或0和0
products in here or 0 from that and 0

396
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,894
从那以后它是有效的，我们可以
from that yeah it works and we could

397
00:23:53,899 --> 00:24:00,245
继续到16和32和64然后
keep going to 16 and 32 and 64 but then

398
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:07,355
关于H12是什么问题
up comes a question what about H 12 is

399
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,394
那里有一个减去矩阵的大小
there ones and minus ones matrix of size

400
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:19,225
1212乘12
12 12 by 12 it

401
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,445
它并非直接来自我们的小事
it doesn't come directly from our little

402
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,085
每个都是大小加倍的模式
pattern which is doubling size every

403
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,415
时间，但你仍然可以希望和它
time but you could still hope and it

404
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,845
工作有一个我不知道它是什么
works there is a I don't know what it is

405
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,965
但有一个有那些矩阵
but there's a there's a matrix of ones

406
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,845
和正十二
and minus ones orthogonal twelve

407
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,515
正交列所以答案是肯定的
orthogonal columns so the answer is yes

408
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,795
好的，所以我们做了一个1806五个猜想
okay so we make an 1806 five conjecture

409
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,935
每个矩阵大小的每个矩阵都没有
every matrix every matrix size well not

410
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,245
每个矩阵大小，因为3x3不是
every matrix size because 3x3 is not

411
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,125
上班逐一不会
going to work one by one is not going to

412
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,855
工作要么是十二岁以上的作品
work either but age twelve works

413
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,995
h/h16我们猜想的是什么
h/h sixteen what's our conjecture we

414
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,845
不会是第一个猜想-就是这样
won't be the first conjecture --it that

415
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,135
还有那些和负者
there is a ones and minus ones

416
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,515
正交矩阵与正交
orthogonal matrix with orthogonal

417
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,955
每个尺寸的列都是如此
columns of every size n so always so so

418
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,405
我会开始猜测总是可能的
I'll start to conjecture always possible

419
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,335
if和哪个是矩阵的大小
if and which is the size of the matrix

420
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:35,335
让我们说你猜的是什么
let's say what would you guess just take

421
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,225
一枪你不会被要求提供证据
a shot you won't be asked for a proof

422
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:43,915
因为没有人能够证明这一点
because nobody has the proof even well

423
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,795
即使你可以看，你也希望如此
you could hope for even you could look

424
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,405
尝试六我猜是第一个
for try six I guess would be the first

425
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,235
那里的家伙，我不认为这是
guy there and I don't think it's

426
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,975
可能我认为六是不可能的
possible I think six is not possible so

427
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,425
每个均匀的尺寸都是我想不会的
every even sizes is I think not gonna

428
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,025
工作，但尝试什么是自然的想法
work but it's natural idea to try what's

429
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,265
接下来想到每四个的倍数
the next thought every multiple of four

430
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:18,995
如果n超过四是一个整数
if n over four is a whole number

431
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,025
所以，没有人有办法系统化
so but nobody has a way a systematic way

432
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,655
创造这些东西，就像一些
to create these things so like some of

433
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,155
他们是我们在这一点上我们失败了
them are we're at this point we're down

434
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,495
一次做一个，我们就这样做了
to doing it one at a time and we're up

435
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,985
到668但我们还没有那个
to 668 but we haven't got that one yet

436
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,355
这并不是那么疯狂所以这一切都将到来
isn't that crazy so all this is coming

437
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,965
来自维基百科我的简短来源
from Wikipedia my source of my short

438
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,605
我的老鼠在其所有的好来源
mice my source of all its good in

439
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,845
无论如何，数学都存在于维基百科上
mathematics is there on Wikipedia anyway

440
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,175
这是猜想猜想的意思
this is the conjecture conjecture means

441
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,005
你是否有任何该死的想法
you don't have any damn idea of whether

442
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,545
这是真的还是假的，每一个是
it's true or not that every is that

443
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,515
四分之一是的，我猜它会的
divisible by four yeah I guess it would

444
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,385
是600肯定是68是啊
be right 600 certainly is and 68 yeah

445
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,525
好的
okay

446
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,205
所以我认为这是第一个
so I think that's the first one that's

447
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,715
所以任何人，如果你找到一个大小
so anybody if if you find one of size

448
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,995
六，你只是跳过作业和
six six you just skip the homework and

449
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,745
告诉我们这个，但我不认为
tell us about that one but I don't think

450
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,465
我会指定他们是的我猜是的好
I'll assign them yeah I guess well yeah

451
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,335
我必须在网上搜索它是的
I must have searched for it online yeah

452
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,235
反正所以这些都是亚当的
anyway so those are the Adam are

453
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,375
矩阵现在我还记得其他地方
matrices now where else do I remember

454
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,635
正交矩阵来自井
orthogonal matrices coming from well

455
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,745
是的，真的是一些人的最大来源
yeah really the biggest source of some

456
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,605
我正在寻找正交矩阵
what I'm looking for orthogonal matrices

457
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,325
我正在寻找正交的基础
I'm looking for a basis of orthogonal

458
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,225
矢量，我们在数学上，我会去
vectors and we're in math am I going to

459
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,315
发现出来是向量
find vectors that come out to be

460
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,855
正交我们还没有看到那个
orthogonal we haven't seen that's the

461
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,375
笔记的下一部分，但也许你
next section of the notes but maybe you

462
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,825
其中被记住排序，我们将
were remembering where will we sort of

463
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,745
像自动显示了
like automatically show up with

464
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,205
他们可能是正交向量
orthogonal vectors they could be the

465
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,505
对称矩阵和特征向量的特征向量
eigenvectors of symmetric matrix and

466
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,745
那是最重要的
that's where the most important ones

467
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,385
来自哦，我可以告诉你
come from oh I could tell you about

468
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,055
虽然小波更像是小波
wavelets though wavelets are more like

469
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,275
这张照片是他们的减号
this picture they're ones and minus ones

470
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,765
或者最简单的小波就是那些
or the simplest wavelets are ones

471
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,435
-一旦我可以砍它之前，我去上
- once can I cut it before I go on to

472
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,855
在该特征向量的企业可以我
the to the eigenvector business can I

473
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,055
提到小波矩阵是的，这些
mention the wavelets matrices yeah these

474
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,175
这些都非常简单
are these are really important simple

475
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,335
和小波的重要结构
and important constructions so wavelets

476
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:54,165
让我是啊，让我画的这么一个画面
let me yeah let me draw a picture of so

477
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,195
所以我要提出四方面的方法
so I'm going to come up with four-way

478
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,865
我会做四个四个案例和
I'll do the four by four case and and

479
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:06,075
这是这些，这些是直角
this is these these are the orthogonal

480
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,115
伙计们然后下一个就是了
guys and then the next one is up and

481
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:18,645
向下和0，最后一个是0和向上
down and 0 and the last one is 0 and up

482
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,905
上下所以这是这对的事情，但
and down so that's that's for things but

483
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,275
让我告诉你矩阵所以我打电话给你
let me show you the matrix so I'll call

484
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,055
它是W的小波，所以我是谁
it W for wavelets so that guy I'm

485
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,415
以为我是1111这个人我是
thinking I was 1 1 1 1 this guy I'm

486
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,985
想到的是11减1减1
thinking of as 1 1 minus 1 minus 1 it's

487
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,895
看起来有点原子，但是
looking sort of atom hard way but but

488
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,165
这个家伙有1个不同之处
there's a difference here this guy is 1

489
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:47,735
减100所以小波重新缩放
minus 1 0 0 so the wavelets rescale

490
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,845
这就是它们之间的区别
that's that's the difference between

491
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,995
原子arden小波小波正在缩放
atom arden wavelets wavelets are scaling

492
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,035
自我缩放，最后一个人是什么
self scaling and what's the last guy

493
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,825
这是第四列的内容
here what's the fourth column from that

494
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:14,835
第四小波001减1是啊哈
fourth wavelet 0 0 1 minus 1 yeah so har

495
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,195
想到这就是哈尔
came up with that this is the haar

496
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,265
小波是多年前的
wavelet which was many years before the

497
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,275
小波词被发明，他想出了
word wavelets was invented he came up

498
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,765
用这种结构恐怖恐怖
with this construction the horror horror

499
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,575
恐怖矩阵有功能所以
the horror matrix there are functions so

500
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,635
他们是非常简单的功能
they're very simple functions but you

501
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,655
知道你可以
know you can

502
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,085
这使他们可以使用这是事实
that makes them usable that's the fact

503
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,265
他们现在很简单，我不知道
that they're so simple now I don't know

504
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:44,945
如果我们想要
if we want

505
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,865
看到模式是八乘八但是
see the pattern an eight-by-eight but

506
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,745
让我开始8x8让你知道
let me start the 8x8 so you you'll know

507
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,685
小波是什么，你会知道什么
what wavelets are about you'll know what

508
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,395
无论如何，这些恐怖小说都是有关的
these horror wavelets are about anyway

509
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,265
他们就是那些人
they're they're the ones that were that

510
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:03,045
我们很容易想象，所以让我们
we're kind of easy to visualize so let's

511
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,225
如果那是w-4让我们就这么说吧
this is if that's w-4 let's let's just

512
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,355
花一点时间
take a minute

513
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,915
它不会花很长时间，所以WH
it won't take long for WH okay so the

514
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,225
第一列将是八个
first column is going to be eight ones

515
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,925
好的
okay

516
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:26,865
什么是下一栏将是四个
and what's the next column gonna be four

517
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,035
一个和四个减去像这样四个
ones and four minus ones like so so four

518
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,825
一个和四个减去
ones and four minus ones

519
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:42,825
好的，现在是下一个颜色---
okay and now the next color - ones - -

520
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:48,555
1和0减去1减1
ones and zeros right 1 1 minus 1 minus 1

521
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,495
0和第四个将是零和
and 0 and the fourth will be zeros and

522
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,905
两个月两个月我们得到了一半
two ones and two months we got half a

523
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:04,185
矩阵现在，如果我们只是告诉我
matrix now now if we just tell me the

524
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,905
第五，我觉得你是怎么回事
fifth I'm what do you think what do I

525
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:12,335
放在第五个，所以它会再次
put in the fifth one so again it's gonna

526
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,235
挤压和重新缩放，这是什么
squeeze down and rescale and what's the

527
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,185
第五栏就在这里
fifth column up here that's gonna be

528
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,695
现在如此，减去零和零
ones and minus ones and zeros now so

529
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,745
它不在AMARG
it's not at AMARG

530
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,715
这很难，我应该怎么做
it's har and what should I put 1 1 how

531
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,775
他们从1101开始，然后是
they start with 1 101 my yeah and then

532
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:42,285
所有那些零哦是的，谢谢完美1
all those zeros oh yeah thanks perfect 1

533
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,415
减去1然后它们全部为零
minus 1 and they're all zeros and then

534
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,305
接下来的三栏说我们会有
the next three column says we'll have

535
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,455
这里1减1，减1减1
the 1 minus 1 here and the 1 minus 1

536
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,365
这里和1减1在这里，我看到了
here and the 1 minus 1 here and I saw

537
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,215
零，所以你看到它的模式
zeros yeah so you see the pattern it's

538
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,945
每一步都要缩放
scaling at every step

539
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,404
并与使矩阵具有
and and the so that matrix has the

540
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:06,674
优势是相当稀疏的排序
advantage of being quite sparse sort of

541
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:14,505
这在我的脑海里是一个或者是为了
this this in my mind is a or but for

542
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,524
那些参与喜欢的人
ones that's involved with like taking

543
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:24,375
平均然后这个家伙就像服用
the average then this guy is like taking

544
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,865
差异之间的差异
the differences differences between

545
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,294
那些和那些然后这就像
those and those and then this is like

546
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,745
以较小的规模取得差异
taking the difference at a smaller scale

547
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,144
我也不是那么小
I'm not also at a smaller scale so

548
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,544
这就是我们一直在做的事耶。是的
that's what we keep doing yeah yeah

549
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:42,495
所以这个小波看起来很简单
so that's wavelets it looks so simple

550
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:49,695
对，但只在一分钟
right but at the just a one minute

551
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,154
小波的历史苏哈尔发明了这一点
history of wavelet Sohar invented this

552
00:33:52,159 --> 00:34:00,435
在1910年，我的意思是永远，但是
in like 1910 I mean along forever but

553
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,735
那么你想这是一个小波
then you wanted wavelets that were a

554
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:09,735
好一点，而不只是一些和
little better and not just ones and

555
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,805
减去零和零
minus ones and zeros and it that took

556
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,874
有些人经常思考很多
some some a lot of thinking a lot of

557
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,215
人们正在寻找它和英格丽德
people were searching for it and Ingrid

558
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,084
土桥
dobashi

559
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:24,195
所以我只会把她的名字变得出名
so I'll just put her name became famous

560
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:33,465
为了在1988年左右找到它们
for finding them so in about 1988 she

561
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,935
发现了很多小波的家庭和
found a lot of families of wavelets and

562
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,995
当我说小波时，她发现了一个整体
when I say wavelets she found a whole

563
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,455
很多正交矩阵
lot of orthogonal matrices that were

564
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,515
那个有很好的属性，所以那就是
that had good properties yep so that's

565
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,834
这就是现在好的照片浪潮
that's the wave of a picture okay now to

566
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:55,725
今天关闭，并与下一个连接
close today and to connect with the next

567
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,875
关于特征值特征向量的讲座
lecture on eigenvalues eigenvectors

568
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,465
正定矩阵我们真的
positive definite matrices we're really

569
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,705
让事物的心脏在这里
getting to the heart of things here

570
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,945
让我讲述这个想法
let me follow through on that idea

571
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:17,045
所以对称矩阵的特征向量
so the eigenvectors of symmetric matrix

572
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:23,615
而且正交矩阵也是
but also of an orthogonal matrix are

573
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:34,755
正交，这是真的在哪里
orthogonal and that is really where

574
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,145
你可以发明的人，因为你
people where you can invent because you

575
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,275
你不必努力工作就能找到一个
don't have to work hard you just find a

576
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,865
对称矩阵的特征向量
symmetric matrix its eigenvectors are

577
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,445
自动正交一点不
automatically orthogonal that doesn't

578
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,505
意味着它们非常适合使用，但有些
mean they're great for for use but some

579
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:55,205
其中非常重要
of them are really important and that

580
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,185
可能是最重要的是
may be the most important of all is the

581
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,995
傅丽叶所以你可能已经看过了
fourier so you probably have seen

582
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,695
傅立叶系列正弦和余弦
Fourier series sines and cosines those

583
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,995
伙计们是正交函数但是
guys are orthogonal functions but

584
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,765
离散傅立叶级数是什么
discrete Fourier series is what

585
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,315
每个人都在计算，而那些是
everybody computes and those are

586
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,405
正交向量所以正交
orthogonal vectors so the orthogonal

587
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,635
进入离散的矢量
vectors that go into the discrete

588
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,685
傅里叶变换，然后他们是
Fourier transform and and then they're

589
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,145
由快速傅立叶高速完成
done at high speed by the fast Fourier

590
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,895
转变
transform

591
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,035
那些是q特征向量的特征向量
those are eigenvectors of q eigenvectors

592
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,135
正确的q所以让我发明一下
of the right q so let me just invent the

593
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,285
对，告诉你正确的q得到
right tell you the right q that get

594
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,915
其特征向量所以，所以我在这里我们去
whose eigenvectors so so i here we go

595
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:50,385
我可以Q的载体让我你会
I can vectors of Q let me you will just

596
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,685
惊讶于这个矩阵是多么简单
be amazed by how simple this matrix is

597
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,335
它只是那个矩阵，它被称为a
it's just that matrix it's a called a

598
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,995
排列矩阵它只是把它
permutation matrix it just puts the

599
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,545
那些是傅立叶的四个八
those are the four eight for Fourier

600
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,575
离散离散让我说出自己的意思
discrete discrete let me put their word

601
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,715
离散这里转移
discrete up here transfer

602
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,334
所以我真的打算放弃
so I really meant to put discrete

603
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:26,695
傅里叶变换是的
Fourier transform yeah

604
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,264
该矩阵的特征向量首先是
the eigenvectors of that matrix first of

605
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:36,304
它们都是正交的，然后是第二个
all they are orthogonal and then second

606
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:37,834
而且更重要的是他们是
and more important they're they're

607
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,505
他们是非常有用的
tremendously useful they're the they're

608
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,804
你知道的信号处理的核心
the heart of signal processing you know

609
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:49,445
他们只是采取信号处理
in in signal processing they just take

610
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,364
a的离散傅立叶变换
the discrete Fourier transform of a

611
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,225
矢量之前他们甚至看着它我
vector before they even look at it I

612
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,475
意味着它就像是看待它的方式
mean it's like that's the way to see it

613
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,655
把它分成它的频率和
is split it into its frequencies and

614
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,024
那就是这个特征向量
that's what the eigenvectors of this

615
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,175
我们会这样做的
will do so we're going to see the

616
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,135
离散傅里叶变换，但我的
discrete Fourier transform and but my

617
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,794
这里要指出的是，他们是
point here is to know that they're

618
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:15,784
正交刚刚出来了
orthogonal is just comes out of this

619
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:17,824
事实是，特征向量
fact that the eigenvectors are

620
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:21,635
对于任何Q都是正交的
orthogonal for any Q and that is

621
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,294
肯定是Q每个人都可以看到
certainly a Q everybody can see that

622
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:29,344
这些列与列正交
those columns are orthogonal the columns

623
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,774
作为排列矩阵的印刷品
of a print that's a permutation matrix

624
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,985
对，这是你已经采取的列
right it's a you've taken the columns of

625
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,514
完全的身份
the identity which are totally

626
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,975
正交，你只需将它们放入
orthogonal and you just put them in a

627
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,945
不同的顺序，所以一个排列矩阵
different order so a permutation matrix

628
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,225
是对单位矩阵的重新排序
is a reordering of the identity matrix

629
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:50,485
它必须是一个q，因此它
it's got to be a q and therefore its

630
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,824
特征向量是正交的，它们是正交的
eigenvectors are orthogonal and they're

631
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:58,985
只是赢家我的意思是
just the winners i mean that the the

632
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,864
与傅立叶矩阵的矩阵
matrix of the fourier matrix with those

633
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:04,834
我将告诉你四个特征向量
four eigen vectors in it I'll show you

634
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:07,054
现在没关系，所以这真的是我们
now okay so this is really we're

635
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:10,675
今天通过领先进入完成
finishing today by leading into

636
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,885
星期三
Wednesday

637
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,245
我可以向量和特征值和我们
I can vectors and eigen values and we

638
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,955
碰巧正在做本征向量和
happen to be doing eigen vectors and

639
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,354
队列的特征值不是今天的
eigen values of a queue not today of an

640
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:25,445
在大多数情况下，它是对称的
S well most of the time it's a symmetric

641
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,084
我们采用的特征向量矩阵
matrix whose eigenvectors we take but

642
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:31,084
这里碰巧是我可以展示的aq
here that happens to be a q can I show

643
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,675
你是特征向量
you the eigenvectors

644
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:40,564
的，现在哦四个特征向量
the four eigenvectors of that now oh the

645
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:43,265
复数我会进来的
complex number I is going to come in you

646
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,655
你必须让它在这里，是的
have to you have to let it in here yeah

647
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,405
抱歉，如果s是真正对称的s
sorry ma if s if s is a real symmetric

648
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,635
矩阵的特征向量是真实的，但如果
matrix its eigenvectors are real but if

649
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,084
q是一个正交矩阵
q is a orthogonal matrix its

650
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:03,395
特征向量，即使你知道
eigenvectors even though it's you know

651
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,094
你不能要求更真实的矩阵
you couldn't ask for a more real matrix

652
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:11,344
比那个，但它的特征向量是
than that but its eigenvectors are at

653
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:15,564
至少一个耶的好方法是
least yeah the one the good way are

654
00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:18,544
复数，所以我可以告诉你
complex numbers so can I show you the

655
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:28,265
整体上的特征向量
eigenvectors of so again overall the

656
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,715
今天的观点是看正交
point today is to see orthogonal

657
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,375
矩阵所以我现在就重复一遍
matrices so I'll just repeat now while I

658
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,594
能够
can

659
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:52,415
旋转这里反射小波
rotations here reflections wavelets the

660
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,015
家庭主人对大思考的看法
householder idea of reflections of big

661
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,524
具有这种形式的大型矩阵I.
large matrices that have this form I

662
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:03,094
减去2uu转置正交现在
minus 2 uu transpose orthogonal and now

663
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:08,155
我们将会看到大家伙
we're going to see the big guys the the

664
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,604
q的特征向量是的哦是的我们
eigenvectors of q right yes oh yeah we

665
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,765
我们没有正确的正交法
don't have orthonormal that's right we

666
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,135
没有正交我更好的划分
don't have orthonormal I better divide

667
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,385
通过8的平方根哦是啊所以
by square root of 8 right oh yeah so

668
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,625
你是对的，我以为我会得到
you're right sorry I thought I'd get

669
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,735
远离那个，但我没有，所以
away with that but I didn't yeah so

670
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,375
这些家伙是8的螺丝所以这些
these guys are screws of 8 so are these

671
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,465
但是这些家伙是4个人的成果
but these guys are fruits of 4 and these

672
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,284
伙计们很擅长-绝对地谢谢你
guys are screw to - thank you absolutely

673
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:45,055
对，是的，是的
right absolutely yeah

674
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,265
好吧那么什么是a的特征向量
okay so what are the eigenvectors of a

675
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,275
这将是一种排列
of a permutation this is going to be

676
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,695
很高兴看到，我将使用矩阵F.
nice to see and I'll use the matrix F

677
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:05,635
对于那的特征向量矩阵
for the eigenvector matrix of that of

678
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,335
那个队列那个，F代表
that of that queue up there and F is for

679
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,975
对你来说，它是四乘四的
for you and it be the four by four for a

680
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,465
矩阵好吧什么是特征向量
matrix okay what are the eigenvectors of

681
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:24,685
Q好吧所以Q是一种排列，就像我一样
Q okay so Q is a permutation so like I'm

682
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,205
要问你的一个特征向量
gonna ask you for one eigenvector of

683
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,175
每个排列矩阵什么的
every permutation matrix what what

684
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,055
矢量你能告诉我它实际上
vector can you tell me that it actually

685
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,025
特征值将是一个向量
the eigenvalue will be one what vector

686
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,235
你能告诉我，如果我置换它我会在哪里
can you tell me where if i permute it I

687
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,285
不要一一改变它
don't change it one one one one it's

688
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,925
喜欢它的无处不在这里一个一个一个
like it's everywhere here one one one

689
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:51,295
一，这就是零频率傅立叶
one so that's the zero frequency Fourier

690
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:51,925
向量
vector

691
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,585
每个人都是恒定的向量
the constant vector all ones everybody

692
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,165
看到如果我乘以Q它
sees that if I I multiply by Q it

693
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,105
不会改变现在下一个
doesn't change okay now the next one

694
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,975
我会告诉你现在的下一个
I'll show you the for now the next one

695
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,025
将是一个II平方，我立方
will be one I I squared and I cubed

696
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,355
当然我平方我不知道怎么回事
of course I squared I don't know how

697
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,955
很多当然6j人都在这
many course 6j people are in this

698
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,685
观众但这是我们的数学建筑
audience but this is a math building we

699
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,805
支付它，它是190，它是我在
pay for it it's to 190 and it's I in

700
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,155
这个房间是的
this room yeah

701
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:34,405
所以无论如何我是第一封信
so anyway I is the first letter in in

702
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,795
什么想象的，先谢谢你
what imaginary thank you the first

703
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,945
想象中的字母你不能说
letter in imaginary you can't say

704
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,675
想象中所以这样就可以了
imaginary so so so that's it okay and

705
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,575
那么下一个是一个我我的平方
then the next one is one I squared I

706
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,965
第四，我六，下一个是我
fourth I six and the next one is one I

707
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:53,995
立方体我六个i-9
cubed I six an i-9

708
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,655
那不仅仅是美丽和你
that's isn't that just beautiful and you

709
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,555
可以
could

710
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,225
表明这四个中的每一个
show that every one of those four

711
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,405
列，如果你乘以Q你
columns if you multiply them by Q you

712
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:09,385
会得到特征值，你会的
would get the eigenvalues and you would

713
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,385
看到它是一个特征向量，这是
see that it's an eigenvector and this is

714
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,355
就像一个离散的傅立叶
just sort of like a discrete fourier

715
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,965
东西，你知道而不是我
stuff and you know instead of e to the I

716
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,225
II到IXe到2iXe到3IX
II to the IX e to the 2i X e to the 3 IX

717
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:27,775
等等，我们只有矢量，但我也是
and so on we just have vectors but I so

718
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,985
那些是四个特征向量
those are the four eigenvectors of the

719
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:35,185
那种排列的那些和那些
of that of that permutation and those

720
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:40,815
是正交的，因为我只是检查一下
are orthogonal because I just check that

721
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,465
你怎么知道这第一栏
how do you know that this first column

722
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,805
在第二口井我应该说
in the second well I should really say

723
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,895
如果我是的话，第0列和第1列
0th column and first column if I'm if

724
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,295
我说的频率你看到了吗？
I'm talking frequencies do you see that

725
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,355
与那个井正交的Y是一个
that's orthogonal to that well Y is one

726
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,895
再加上我加上我的平方加上我的立方体相等
plus I plus I squared plus I cube equal

727
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,205
零是这是点积
zero that's the dot product this is

728
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:11,785
第1列点列2是的，是的，你是
column 1 dot column 2 yeah yeah you're

729
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:12,205
对
right

730
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:18,525
这恰好出来0是对的
this happens to come out 0 is that right

731
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:23,245
那个会出来0但是有人
that'll come out 0 but somebody

732
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,795
提到这是不对的
mentioned that this isn't right this is

733
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,315
我的意思是说出来了
I mean that it's true that that came out

734
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,395
0但是当我有虚构的向量时
0 but when I have imaginary vector

735
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,685
想象中的数字如此随处可见
imaginary numbers so anywhere around

736
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,725
这不是正确的点积
this isn't the correct dot product to

737
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,195
如果我有想象的话，测试正交
test orthogonal if I have imaginary

738
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,665
如果我有复杂的复杂载体
complex vectors if I have complex

739
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,595
数字复杂的向量我应该测试
numbers complex vectors I should test

740
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,885
第1列共轭点2列
column 1 conjugate dotted with column 2

741
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,115
第一栏我很好地结合了
column I conjugate well let me take

742
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,735
C列我应该选择哪一个
column C what which one shall I take

743
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,215
也许那个家伙很多人
maybe that guy in that guy many of them

744
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,045
你好运，但我真的
you luck out here but but really I

745
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,214
应该是
should be

746
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:15,974
考虑其共轭那么那么那么这些
taking their conjugate so so so these

747
00:46:15,979 --> 00:46:18,314
但事情就是国家了
ones but the thing is the country the

748
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,924
一个复共轭是一个这样的
complex conjugate of one is one so that

749
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:24,944
那是好的，但总的来说，如果我
was that was okay but in general if I

750
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:29,264
想把第二列点缀起来
wanted to take column two dotted with

751
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:33,885
专栏我不知道可能会有四个
column I don't know maybe four would be

752
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,914
有点狡猾的样子看起来很棒
a little dodgy yeah look look what

753
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,544
发生
happens

754
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:41,894
把那一列和那一列拿走
take that column and that column take

755
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:47,385
他们积做了错误的方式使
their dot product do it the wrong way so

756
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,844
什么是错误的方式
what's the wrong way

757
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:52,154
忘记复杂的共轭和
forget about the complex conjugate and

758
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,854
按照常规方式这样做一次
just do it the usual way so one times

759
00:46:54,859 --> 00:47:02,534
一个是我一次我立方体是1我平方
one is one I times I cube is 1 I squared

760
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:06,524
我六岁就是一个我得到所有的人
times I six is one I'm getting all ones

761
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:10,094
我没有在那里获得正交性
I'm not getting a orthogonality there

762
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:12,314
那是因为我忘记了我
and that's because I forgot that I

763
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,224
应该很好地采用复共轭
should take the complex conjugate well

764
00:47:15,229 --> 00:47:18,544
这些家伙之一，我应该负我
of these guys one I should take minus I

765
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:22,334
减去我的方形减去我的确这是真的
minus I square minus i well that's real

766
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:28,064
所以没关系-他们真是太消极了
so it's okay - they're so so minus I

767
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:33,344
平方仍然减去一，所以现在如果我
squared is still minus one so now if I

768
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:38,174
这样做是零，所以让我
do it it comes out zero so so let me

769
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:40,125
再说一遍，让我这样做吧
repeat again let me just make this

770
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:47,894
声明如果Q转置Q是I和QX
statement if Q transpose Q is I and Q X

771
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:53,625
是lambdaX，QY是不同的本征
is lambda X and Q Y is a different eigen

772
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:58,994
价值Y好吧所以我正在设置
value Y okay so I'm I'm setting up the

773
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:01,994
在最后一分钟，我是主要的事实
main fact that in the last minute I'm

774
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:03,854
要记下来，所以我有一个
just gonna write down so I have an

775
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:06,704
正交矩阵我有一个特征向量
orthogonal matrix I have an eigenvector

776
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:09,404
与特征值lambda我有另一个
with eigenvalue lambda I have another

777
00:48:09,409 --> 00:48:11,654
具有不同特征值的特征向量
eigenvector with a different eigen value

778
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:15,375
亩，则要求是什么
mu then the claim is that what is the

779
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,214
声称关于特征向量所以这里
claim about the eigenvectors so here's

780
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:21,794
有一个本征，它有一个特征值
has one eigen this has an eigen value

781
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,675
这具有不同的特征值
this has a different eigen value

782
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,415
我需要他们不同的真
I need them to be different to really

783
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,594
知道他们是XS和Y的
know that they're the XS and the Y's

784
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,415
不能是一样的那么我是什么
can't be the same so what is it that I

785
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,935
希望表明XI必须这样做
want to show yes that X I have to

786
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,005
记得这样做X转置Y是0
remember to do that X transpose Y is 0

787
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,455
这是正交性的
that's orthogonality that's

788
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,755
我有复杂载体的正交性
orthogonality for complex vectors I have

789
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,354
要记住要改变每一个
to remember to take the to change every

790
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,375
我在载体之一和负我
I to a minus I in one of the vectors and

791
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,985
我可以通过玩耍证明这一事实
I can prove that fact by playing with

792
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:04,844
这些都是通过开始玩
these these by playing with starting

793
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:08,385
从这里我可以得到那就好了
from here I can get to that ok that's it

794
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,725
我们今天做了很多很多事情
we've done a lot today a lot of stuff

795
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:14,024
关于正交矩阵的重要矩阵
about orthogonal matrices important ones

796
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:18,854
和我重要的来源
and the sources of important ones I ghen

797
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:21,599
vectors and so it'll be eigenvectors on

798
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:24,609
矢量，所以它将是特征向量

799
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:24,609
