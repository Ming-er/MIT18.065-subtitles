43
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,664
深度学习，所以它涉及创建一个
deep learning so it involves creating a

44
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,564
学习功能该功能需要
learning function the function takes the

45
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:56,414

什么是这样的功能
what's the function like that's what

48
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,725
数学是关于功能的
mathematics is about functions so it

49
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,195
涉及配偶它涉及矩阵
involves mate it involves matrix

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,344

通过矩阵乘以向量
multiplying vectors by matrices so

52
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,374
这是一堆步骤，但如果有的话
that's a bunch of steps but if there was

53
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,654
只有它是所有线性代数

甚至可以告诉你它是什么
can even tell you what it is it's the

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,694
函数f让我们称之为X的ff
function f let's call it f f of X is

63
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,824
如果X是正数而f是X，则等于X.
equal to X if X is positive and f of X

64
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,785
如果X为负数，则为0，这样您就可以想象
is 0 if X is negative so you can imagine

65
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,124
它的图表是一条平坦的线条

function that's a crucial step so this

77
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,035
是一个最小化错误的问题
is a problem of minimizing the error

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,815
所有这些矩阵条目为
with all those matrix entries as

79
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,655
变量因此这是多变量的
variables so this is multivariable

80
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,435
微积分就像十万五
calculus like a hundred thousand five

81
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,015
十万变量只是
hundred thousand variables is just

82
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,725
在基础微积分课程中是不可想象的但是
unthinkable in basic calculus course but

83
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,775
它发生在一家公司里面
it's happening in in a company that's

84
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,595
深学习工作，所以这是
working with deep learning and so that's

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,905
这是深刻的巨大计算
it that's the giant calculation of deep

86
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,325
了解这是GPU的发展方向
learning that's what keeps GPUs going

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,755
一个星期，但它给出了惊人的结果
for a week but it gives amazing results

88
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,335
这在以前是无法实现的
that could never have been achieved in

89
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,245
过去那么另一个关键主题
the past so then the other key subject

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,385
是统计和基本思路
is statistics and the basic ideas of

91
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,345
统计在这里起作用，因为何时
Statistics play a role here because when

92
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,475
你将整个序列相乘
you're multiplying a whole sequence of

93
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,835
深度学习的矩阵非常
matrices in deep learning it's very

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,445
这些数字可能会增长
possible for the numbers to grow out of

95
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,075
以指数方式或降至零
sight exponentially or to drop to zero

96
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,435
而这两个都是坏消息
and both of those are bad news for the

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,195
学习功能所以你需要保持
learning function so you need to keep

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,005
右边的平均值和方差
the mean and variance at the right spot

99
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,985
保持这些数字在学习中
to keep those numbers in the learning

100
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,975
将这些矩阵运用于良好的功能中
function those matrices in in a good

101
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,415
范围所以你这个课程不会是一个
range so it's you this course won't be a

102
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,685
统计课程，但它会使用
statistics course but it will use

103
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,955
深度学习这样的统计数据
statistics as deep learning does so

104
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,985
那些是线性的四个主题
those are the four subjects linear

105
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,935
代数和深度学习两大问题
algebra and deep learning two big ones

106
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,025
优化和统计必不可少
