00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:26,295
好的，所以我有一些想法
ok so I've got a few things in mind for

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,475
今天一个是回答这两个问题
today one is to answer those two

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,745
我们回答的第二行问题
questions on the second line we answered

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,445
我们发现了这两个公式
the two we found those two formulas on

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,495
第一行
the first line

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,215
上次反转的导数如此
last time the derivative of a inverse so

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,915
平方的导数应该是
the derivative of a squared ought to be

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,545
很容易，但如果我们不能这样做，我们需要
easy but if we can't do that we need to

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,665
可以肯定，我们可以再这是
be sure we can and then this was the

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,795
然后是特征值的导数
derivative of an eigenvalue and then

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,915
关于衍生品的问题很自然
it's natural asked about the derivative

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,855
奇异的价值，我很高兴
of the singular value and i had a happy

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,915
昨天在雪中实现的那一天
day yesterday in the snow realizing that

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,705
当然也有一个很好的公式
that has a nice formula too of course

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:10,085
我不是第一个我敢肯定，
I'm not the first I'm sure that

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,335
维基百科已经知道这个公式但是
Wikipedia already knows this formula but

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,065
这对我来说是新的，我应该说
it was new to me and I should say

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,665
阿德尔曼教授把它带到了
professor Adelman has carried it to the

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,995
二阶导数再次不是新的，但它是
second derivative again not new but it's

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,705
它更难以找到第二
it's more difficult to find second

29
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,085
衍生物和有趣的但会
derivatives and interesting but would

30
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,044
你和第一衍生品一样好吧
you stay with first derivatives okay so

31
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,735
这是我的第一件商品
it's my first item of sort of business

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,404
从上次开始，然后我想说
from last time and then I'd like to say

33
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,364
一些有关实验室家庭作业，并要求
something about lab homeworks and ask

34
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,095
你的建议，并开始说些什么
your advice and begin to say something

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,385
关于一个项目然后我会搬到
about a project and then I will move to

36
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,085
您在第44节中的这些主题
these topics in section 44 that you have

37
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,015
已经你可能会注意到我跳过了
already and you might notice I skipped

38
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,355
第四0.3，原因在于，上
fourth 0.3 and the reason is that on

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,494
周五实际上明天到达麻省理工学院
Friday actually arriving at MIT tomorrow

40
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,495
是Townsend教授
is Professor Townsend

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,075
他的特别4.3就是他的工作
whose special 4.3 is all about his work

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,154
他是最好的演讲者，我知道他，他
and he's the best lecturer I know he he

43
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,094
做了你知道的8，所以他在这里作为一个
did the 8 you know so he was here as a

44
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,904
指导员并做了1806并且是一个很大的
instructor and did 1806 and was a big

45
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,124
成功
success

46
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:36,175
实际上他也只是赢了奖
actually he's also just won prize for

47
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,525
ZOA国际奖
the ZOA international prize for the for

48
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,755
年轻的调查员年轻
the for young investigators young

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,925
应用线性代数的能力
faculty in applied linear algebra so

50
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,044
他是去香港去做的
he's he goes to Hong Kong to get that

51
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,335
价格无论如何他将在视频上
price to anyway he will be on the videos

52
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,945
如果全部在星期五这里上课
and in here in the class Friday if all

53
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,405
顺利，所以按顺序然后那些
goes well okay so in order then those in

54
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,655
订单第一件事是衍生品
order the first thing is the derivative

55
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,905
一个平方，你可能会认为它是
of a squared and you might think it's to

56
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,185
援助da/dt但它不是，如果你
aid da/dt but it's not and if you

57
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,314
意识到它不是，你意识到
realize that it's not and you realize

58
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,805
你会得到这些东西是什么
what it is you will get these things

59
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,895
就在未来这样的答案
right in the future so the answer to the

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,734
平方的导数不是广告
derivative of a squared is not not to ad

61
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:38,484
一个DT，为什么不是它，它是什么
a DT and why isn't it and what is the

62
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:39,824
正确答案
right answer

63
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:49,105
所以我这样做可能只是在这里
so I do that maybe just below here

64
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,905
有没有人清楚，我是问你
did anybody well I could ask you to

65
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,705
猜测正确的答案，但我们为什么不
guess the right answer but why don't we

66
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,405
系统地做，所以你怎么找到
do it systematically so how do you find

67
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,625
衍生品首先是你的限制
the derivative it's a limit first you

68
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,325
有一个delta右边然后你拿一个
have a delta a right and then you take a

69
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,055
限制所以我看一个加上Deltaa
limit so I look at a plus Delta a

70
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:16,234
平方减去平方所以就是这样
squared minus a squared so that's the

71
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,704
改变一个平方，我用它除以
change in a squared and I divide it by

72
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,915
增量T和然后的ΔT变为0，从而
delta T and then delta T goes to 0 so

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,135
那是我正在寻找的衍生物
that's the derivative I'm looking for

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,645
平方的衍生物，现在如果我
the derivative of a squared and now if I

75
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,855
写出来，你会看到这是为什么
write that out you'll see why this is

76
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,215
错了但是非常接近它的东西
wrong but something very close to it of

77
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,095
当然离不远就是这样
course can't be far away is right so

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,315
如果我把它写出来，会发生什么
what happens if I write this out the a

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,835
平方将取消我的平方
squared will cancel the a squared I'll

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,445
拥有我将拥有的东西-一个
have what will I have will I have - a

81
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,935
delta我为什么不写-deltaa
delta a why don't I write - a delta a

82
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,855
接下来是因为当你是的时候
next because a because when you're

83
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,895
平均一个矩阵的两个矩阵的总和
squaring a sum of two matrices one term

84
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:10,535
是deltaa，另一个术语是Deltaa
is a delta a and another term is Delta a

85
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,095
一个和那些在一般和不同
a and those are different in general and

86
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,835
然后加上DeltaVDelta平方和
then Plus Delta V Delta a squared and

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,595
现在我将它全部除以deltaT所以你是
now I divide it all by delta T so you're

88
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,664
现在看到我的观点，现在我让DeltaT
now seen my point that now I let Delta T

89
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,945
转到0所以我只是做矩阵
go to 0 so I'm just doing matrix

90
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,475
微积分，你知道它不是
calculus and it's you know it's not

91
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,845
完全简单，但如果你遵循
altogether simple but if you follow the

92
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,815
现在出来的规则是正确的
rules it comes out right so now what

93
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,955
我会得到什么答案，因为deltaT去了
what answer do I get as delta T goes to

94
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,914
0我得到一个DADT这是定义
0 I get a DA DT that's the definition of

95
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,685
该
the

96
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,015
这个比例是da/dt那个
that ratio goes to da/dt that's the

97
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,535
a和a的导数的整体思想
whole idea of the derivative of a and

98
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:11,015
现在它的另一个术语就是ETA
now what's the other term it's da ETA so

99
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,955
这只是我想要的那一点
it was simply that point that I wanted

100
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,865
你要接受那个衍生品
you to pick up on that da the derivative

101
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,045
可能不会与矩阵通勤
might not commute with a matrices don't

102
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,435
一般通勤，所以你注意到
commute in general and so you notice

103
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:34,345
我们也有类似的表达中，
that we had a similar expression there

104
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,325
我们必须注意顺序
we had to pay attention to the order of

105
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,635
那里的事情，现在我们做对了
things there and now we get it right

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:49,105
它不是这个，而是daDTplusdaDTa
it's not this but a da DT plus da DT a

107
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,265
好的
okay good

108
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,145
现在，我可以做另一个利基
now can I do the other one niche which

109
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,355
有点严重，但它是一个
is a little more serious but it's it's a

110
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,375
美丽的配方，它是平行的
beautiful formula and it's parallel to

111
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,475
这家伙
this guy

112
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,805
你甚至可能猜到了所以我在寻找
you might even guess it so I'm looking

113
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,755
对于奇异值的导数
for the derivative of a singular value

114
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,255
矩阵a正在改变daDT告诉我
the matrix a is changing da DT tells me

115
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,355
现在它是如何变化的
how it's changing at the moment at the

116
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,625
瞬间，我想知道Sigma是怎样的
instant and I want to know how is Sigma

117
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,135
在同一瞬间改变
changing at that same instant and in

118
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,435
与此并行的是一个很好的
sort of in parallel with this is a nice

119
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,115
D转换daDTV的好公式
D nice formula you transpose da DT V of

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,205
你不能要求更好的男孩
T boy you couldn't ask for a nicer

121
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,155
公式，而不是那么正确，所以它只是
formula and than that right so it's just

122
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,225
这样你还记得这是
like this you remember this is the

123
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,645
特征向量，这是特征向量
eigenvector and that's the eigenvector

124
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,185
转置，所以这是单数
of a transpose so this is the singular

125
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,035
矢量的一个，你可以说这是
vector of a and you could say this is

126
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,345
转置的单数向量或
the singular vector of a transpose or

127
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,985
它是一个左边的奇异向量
it's the left singular vector of a so

128
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,255
那将是我们的
that would be our that's our

129
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,085
公式，如果我们可以回忆如何
formula and if we can just recall how to

130
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,575
证明它将是平行的
prove it which is going to be parallel

131
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,765
为证明那个人然后我是一个
to the proof of that one then I'm a

132
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,944
快乐的人，我们可以继续生活
happy person and we can get on with life

133
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:17,965
好的，所以让我们放手吧
okay so so just let's let's let's

134
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,425
记住这一点，因为它会帮助我们
remember this because it'll help us to

135
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,205
记得另一个太好了，所以在哪里
remember the other one too okay so where

136
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,995
我开始从一个公式开始
do I start I start with a formula for a

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,985
西格玛，所以我相信西格玛是你
sigma so I believe that Sigma is U

138
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:38,545
每个人都转换次数
transpose times a times e everybody

139
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,774
与一切取决于同意
agree with that everything is depending

140
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,955
在这个公式中T作为时间
on T in this in this formula as time

141
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,515
改变一切变化，但我没有
changes everything changes but I didn't

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,395
写在圆括号T三三
write in the parentheses T three three

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,355
我们可以记得更多次了
more times okay can we just remember

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,815
关于SVD，SVD说了一遍
about the SVD the SVD says that a times

145
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,084
V等于保存我，谢谢B是Sigma
V equals save my you thanks a B is Sigma

146
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,454
你这是SVD所以当我投入一个
u that's the SVD so when I put in for a

147
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:19,315
VI放入SigmauSigma只是一个
V I put in Sigma u Sigma is just a

148
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,895
数字，所以我把它带到外面，我
number so I bring it outside and I'm

149
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,595
左带u转U和什么ü
left with u transpose U and what's u

150
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,785
转移你所以我已经使用了这两个
transpose u what so I've used these two

151
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,095
事实或我本可以走另一条路
facts or I could have gone the other way

152
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,595
并说这是转置的
and said that this is the transpose of

153
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,655
这是一个转置我转置我
this is a transpose u transpose I

154
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,454
不能看着这么认为
couldn't look at it that way

155
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:50,725
时间V，如果我这样看，我就是
times V and if I look at it that way I'm

156
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,635
感兴趣的是什么是转置U和
interested in what is a transpose U and

157
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:01,704
什么是转换你的SigmaV和
what is a transpose u its Sigma V and

158
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:06,465
它的转置使SigmaV转置V和
its transpose so Sigma V transpose V and

159
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,155
什么是SigmaV转换V西格玛
what is Sigma V transpose V its Sigma

160
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,334
当然，西格玛两种方式都可以
again of course got Sigma both ways okay

161
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,624
不，现在我准备好了
no now I'm ready to take

162
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,684
这里是一个的公式我有
here's that's the formula I have for

163
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,984
四西格玛完全平行于
four Sigma completely parallel to the

164
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,174
我们开始用的公式
formula that we started out with for

165
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,804
拉姆达特征值为y转斧
lambda the eigenvalue was y transpose ax

166
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,764
现在我们已经让你转换AV和
and now we've got u transpose AV and by

167
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,624
会是什么时候会这样
the way when would those be

168
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,595
这两个公式是同一个
those two formulas be one and the same

169
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,764
当我们会做的SVD的时候只是
when would we when does the SVD just

170
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,334
告诉我们什么都不是新的
tell us nothing new beyond the

171
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,584
什么是矩阵的特征值
eigenvalue stuff for what matrices are

172
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,655
奇异值与...相同
the singular values the same as the

173
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,024
特征值和看到其他向量
eigenvalues and seeing other vectors the

174
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:59,595
与此相同，作为for的特征向量
same as this as the eigenvectors for for

175
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:07,194
对称良好的对称方形和
symmetric good symmetric square and the

176
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,774
我总是在看两个字
two words that i'm them always looking

177
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,234
因为在这个课程中你可以，如果你想
for in this course you could if you want

178
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,764
这个课程中的A只是写下来
an A in this course just write down

179
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:16,434
肯定的时间和答案
positive definite when and the answer to

180
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,524
任何问题，因为西格玛是由
any question because Sigma's are by

181
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,044
定义是积极的，如果他们要去
definition positive and if they're going

182
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,564
那么完全同意lambdas
to agree totally with the lambdas then

183
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:27,414
lambdas必须是积极的或可能的
the lambdas have to be positive or could

184
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:30,564
是0，所以正半正定
be 0 so positive semi definite would be

185
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:32,634
正确答案这是我们的
the right answer anyway this is our

186
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,134
开始很好，而且我们做什么与
start okay and what do we do with that

187
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,924
公式所以我们这一切都是一样的
formula so so we this was all the same

188
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:46,254
因为VtransrtV是我在这里的一个
because V transpose V was one here I had

189
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:48,444
V转置V，这就是它所给出的
V transpose V and that's one so it gave

190
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,095
我是西格玛，是的好
me Sigma yeah good

191
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,824
每个人都用它我做的好做什么
everybody's with it okay what do I do

192
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,465
取导数取
takes the derivative takes the

193
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,004
Box中该方程的导数
derivative of that equation in the Box

194
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,924
正是我上次用的那个
exactly what I did last time with the

195
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,684
lambda的相应方程式相同
corresponding equation for lambda same

196
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,345
事情，我会再次得到它是一个
thing and I'm going to get again it's a

197
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,164
产品规则因为我有三件事
product rule because I have three things

198
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:12,294
在右侧乘以这样
multiplied on the right hand side so

199
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,905
我从产品中得到了三个术语
I've got three terms from the product

200
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,604
规则所以DSigmaDT来自盒子
rule so D Sigma D T coming from the box

201
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:30,254
是你转移DtAV是你
is du u transpose D t AV was you

202
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:36,494
转置daDTV加上第三个人
transpose da DT V plus the third guy

203
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:44,715
这将是新的转换DVD我做的
which will be new transpose a DVD did I

204
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,514
得到三个术语，是的
get the three terms there yep

205
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,914
我是哪个学期我想要哪个学期
I'm which term do I want which term do I

206
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,804
相信将生存并成为
believe is going to survive and be the

207
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:59,624
回答这就是我所追求的
answer well this is what I'm after so

208
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:02,534
这是中期的中期
it's the middle term the middle term is

209
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:08,084
恰到好处，另外两个术语也有
just right and the other two terms had

210
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,874
最好是零，这样就可以了
better be zero so that that will be the

211
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,394
证明其他两个术语将是
proof the to the other two terms will be

212
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,244
零，所以我们可以采取其中之一
zero so can we just take one of those

213
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:20,504
两个术语，表明它是零的
two terms and show that it's zero like

214
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,474
这一次还好我有什么我在这里
this one okay what have I got here I

215
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:27,134
我想知道那个词是零
want to know that that term is zero so

216
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,664
我有什么我有你
what have I got I've got do you

217
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:37,934
转换DT倍AV和每个人
transpose D T times AV and everybody

218
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:42,194
在Sigma中代替AV权利说好的
says okay in place of AV right in Sigma

219
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:44,894
U和Sigma是一个数字所以我不介意
U and Sigma is a number so I don't mind

220
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,764
把它放在那里好，所以我有Sigma
putting it there okay so I've got Sigma

221
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,874
U次的导数的数倍
a number times the derivative of U times

222
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,814
你本身就是衍生品的点积
u itself the dot product the derivative

223
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:58,784
U与你的点产品和那个
of U with dot product with u and that

224
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:07,234
等于零我希望因为这个
equals zero I hope because of this

225
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:13,154
因为我正在接受这个
because of that I'm taking this comes

226
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,884
从那个的衍生物
from the derivative of that the

227
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,184
衍生物将是但但你现在看到了
derivative will be but but you see now

228
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:23,144
我们有点产品普通点
we've got dot products ordinary dot

229
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,144
产品和右边的数字
products and and a number on the right

230
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,845
手边我们在你的身上
hand side we're in dimension one you

231
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,034
可以这么说，这告诉我
could say so this this tells me

232
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,724
立刻就是U的衍生物
immediately that the derivative of U

233
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:42,554
与你加你转置时间
with u plus u transpose times the

234
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,865
U的衍生物
derivative of U

235
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:50,685
是1的导数是0是的
is the derivative of 1 which is 0 yeah

236
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,954
哦，我所说的就是那些
oh all I'm saying is those these are the

237
00:14:53,959 --> 00:15:00,045
同样你知道矢量X转置Y是
same you know vectors X transpose Y is

238
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,014
同样，当我ÿ转X
the same as Y transpose X when I'm

239
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,905
如果我是在谈论实数
talking about real numbers if I was

240
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,485
做我能做的复杂事情
doing complex things which I could do

241
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,444
然后我得注意并采取
then I'd have to pay attention and take

242
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:16,125
如果和，并采取复杂的共轭
if and and take complex conjugates at

243
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,644
正确的时刻，但不是没有麻烦
the right moment but no it's not bother

244
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:24,605
所以你看到这只是其中的两个而且
so you see this is just two of these and

245
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,305
它给我0，这样的术语和高尔夫
it gives me 0 so that terms golf and

246
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,405
同样完全相同的这个术语是
similarly totally similarly this term is

247
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,215
走了这是一个转置U但这是什么
gone this is a transpose U but what this

248
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,115
是一个转置你所有的转置我只是
is a transpose u all transpose I'm just

249
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,855
做同样的事情dv/dt和
doing the same thing times dv/dt and

250
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,535
什么是转置你是SigmaV所以
what is a transpose u it's Sigma V so

251
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,444
这是SigmaV转置DVDT和
this is Sigma V transpose DV DT and

252
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:04,454
再次0因为这样在某种程度上这样
again 0 because of this so in a way this

253
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,274
是一个稍微容易的事情
was a slightly easier thing that the

254
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,165
上次是完全平行的
last time was a completely parallel

255
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,295
计算但第一和第三
computation but the first and third

256
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,475
条款有相互抵消与
terms had to cancel each other with the

257
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,995
X和Y的
X's and Y's

258
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,115
现在他们分开消失了
now they disappear separately leaving

259
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,014
正确答案好吧，你可以
the right answer ok that's you might

260
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,665
想想我们是如何进入衍生品的
think how did we get into derivatives of

261
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,485
奇怪的价值我认为如果我们是
singular values well I think if we're

262
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,694
要了解SVD然后了解
going to understand the SVD then the

263
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,194
Sigma的一阶导数是一个
first derivative of the of Sigma is a

264
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,845
好吧，除了我幸存下来所有这些
well except that I've survived all these

265
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,365
多年没有知道，所以你可以
years without knowing it so you could

266
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,304
说它不是
say it's not

267
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:54,405
你知道你可以在没有它的情况下生活
you know you can you can live without it

268
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:59,595
但这是一个非常好的公式好吧
but it's a pretty nice formula okay that

269
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,824
完成3-1和更多部分
completes that sections 3-1 and and more

270
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,804
要说3/2这是
to say about 3/2 which was the

271
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,225
隔行扫描的部分，我介绍好了
interlacing part that I introduced okay

272
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,544
我在哪里
so where am I

273
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:21,814
我想我正在考虑整洁
I guess I'm thinking about the neat

274
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,294
关于隔行扫描的主题
topics in about interlacing of

275
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,894
特征值所以我可以接受它
eigenvalues so may I pick up on that

276
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:35,505
似乎是特征值的交织而且说
seem interlacing of eigenvalues and say

277
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:43,394
笔记中的一般想法是好的
what's in the notes general idea okay so

278
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:47,625
我们要离开衍生品
we're leaving the leaving derivatives

279
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,365
并转向有限的变化
and moving to finite changes in the

280
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,965
特征值和奇异值我们
eigenvalues and singular values and we

281
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,014
我们认识到我们无法准确
are recognizing that we can't get exact

282
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:03,674
改变的公式，但我们可以得到
formulas for the change but we can get

283
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,435
改变的边界，他们是
bounds for the change and they are

284
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,105
非常酷，所以让我提醒你什么
pretty cool so let me remind you what

285
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,205
这就是他们所以我有一个
that is what they are so so I have a

286
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,345
矩阵是C对称矩阵S
matrix that's C a symmetric matrix S

287
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,565
具有特征值lambda1更大
that has eigenvalues lambda 1 greater

288
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,965
等于lambda2大于等于那么
equal lambda 2 greater equal so on then

289
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,174
我改变了一些我想到的数量
I change s by some amount I think in the

290
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,144
注意到有一些数字说有时候
notes there's a number say there times a

291
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:36,424
排名一个具有特征值的矩阵
rank one matrix that has eigenvalues

292
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,304
查看1大于等于mewtwo更大
view 1 greater equal mewtwo greater

293
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,855
等于什么，这就是我
equal something and these are what I

294
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,664
不能给你一个确切的公式为你
can't give you an exact formula for you

295
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,264
只是必须计算它们，但我
just would have to compute them but I

296
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:57,615
可以给你他们和他们的界限
can give you bounds for them and the

297
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,914
边界来自lambdas所以
bounds come from the lambdas so the

298
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,955
边界是如此，这是积极的
bounds are so this was a positive

299
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,835
这是一个积极的变化所以
this is a positive change so the

300
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,274
特征值会上升或保持不变但是
eigenvalues will go up or stay still but

301
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,764
他们不会失败
they won't go down

302
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:19,494
所以MUSE会比大
so the muse will be bigger than the

303
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:22,284
lambda表达式，但整洁的事情是，他们
lambdas but the neat thing is that they

304
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,575
难道你们两个不会放弃lambda1
don't you two will not pass up lambda 1

305
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,975
所以我会在这里静音隔行扫描
so I'll have mute here's the interlacing

306
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,215
NU1是大于或等于1的λ那
nu 1 is greater or equal lambda 1 that

307
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,614
说顶部的最高特征值
says that the highest eigenvalue the top

308
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,225
特征值上升或没有移动但是
eigenvalue went up or didn't move but

309
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,725
但mu2低于lambda1这个新的
but mu 2 is below lambda 1 the new this

310
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,374
这是新来的人和我在一起
is the new everybody's with me here this

311
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:50,544
是新的，这是旧的和新的
is the new and this is the old new and

312
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,195
老是最古老的snu随着变化
old being oldest s nu is with the change

313
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,965
在s和mu2更大相等
in s and that mu 2 is greater equal

314
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,355
lambda2所以第二个特征值去了
lambda 2 so the second eigen values went

315
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:11,124
那就是那个就是那个
up and then so on that's the that's the

316
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:15,534
很棒的事实，我想我发了一个
great fact and I guess that I sent out a

317
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,325
难题问题是否确实到了
puzzle question did did it arrive in

318
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,225
关于假设的电子邮件
email about suppose so

319
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,054
有没有人看到这个谜题
does anybody see that puzzle question

320
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,014
并考虑一下
and think about it

321
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,244
所以这让我担心了一段时间
so here's it worried me for a while

322
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:34,914
假设这个改变，因为它假设我
suppose this change as it is suppose I'm

323
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,424
在这里添加假设这是
adding on here suppose this is the

324
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:44,634
第二个特征值特征向量所以我
second eigenvalue eigenvector so i'm

325
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:48,445
加上我正在加剧第二次
adding on i'm hyping up the second

326
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,315
特征向量增加了矩阵
eigenvector hyping up the matrix in the

327
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,864
所述第二本征向量的方向，从而
direction of the second eigenvector so

328
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:59,394
我真的是第二个特征值
i'm really so the second eigenvalue was

329
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:04,195
lambda2和它的美丽是新的第二个
lambda 2 and it's beauty the new second

330
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,355
特征值将会更大
eigenvalue is going to be bigger by

331
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,924
theta然后我失去了一点
theta but this then i lost a little

332
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,774
睡觉时思考还行，如果第二个
sleep in thinking okay if the second

333
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,225
特征值是mu2
eigenvalue is mu 2

334
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,155
再加上theta我很抱歉，如果第二个
Plus theta I'm sorry if the second

335
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,794
特征值mewtwo所以让我写出来
eigenvalue mewtwo so so let me write it

336
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:24,125
这里
here

337
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:30,174
如果mu2第二个特征值是旧的
if mu2 the second eigenvalue is the old

338
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:37,565
lambda2加上theta然后然后
lambda 2 plus theta then then then then

339
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:44,975
坏消息因为theta可以像
bad news because theta can be as big as

340
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,325
我希望它可以是2200毫米，当我，如果
I want it can be 2200 mm and when I if

341
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,185
如果我只是添加theta2，这个mu2
this mu 2 if I'm just adding theta 2 to

342
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,664
lambda2得到那个，因为它是
lambda 2 to get that second because it's

343
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:00,875
那是第二个特征向量
the second eigenvector that that's

344
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,424
过了一会儿就抽了一下
getting pumped up then after a while

345
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:10,715
亩TOU将通过拉姆达1，这将是
mu tou will pass lambda 1 this will be

346
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,424
完全正确我不愁
totally true I have no worries about

347
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:15,515
这个老lambda1实际上是旧的
this the old lambda 1 actually the old

348
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,685
旧的我甚至可以有平等这里
the old I'll even have equality here

349
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,615
因为这个特殊的变化是
because for this particular change it's

350
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,475
不影响lambda1所以我认为mu1
not affecting lambda 1 so I think mu 1

351
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,635
在我的假设中会是lambda1in
would be lambda 1 in in my hypothetical

352
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,015
我试图找到你的可能性
possibility where I'm trying to get you

353
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,625
要做的就是思考一下这个
to do is to think through what this

354
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,815
意思是因为写起来很容易
means because it's quite easy to write

355
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,015
那条线，但那时你想
that line there but then when you think

356
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,405
关于它你得到一些问题和它
about it you get some questions and it

357
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,495
它看起来好像可能会失败
looks 10 it looks as if it might fail

358
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,725
是的，因为如果theta真的很大
right because if theta is really big

359
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,965
那个Mew2会传递lambda1和
that Mew 2 would pass up lambda 1 and

360
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,085
事情会失败，必须有
the thing would fail and there has to be

361
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:07,235
捕获它必须是一个捕获所以
a catch it has to be a catch so does

362
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,405
你在电子邮件中看到的任何人
anybody Minh you saw that in the email

363
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,195
我现在要解释一下我的情况
and I'll now explain what I how I

364
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,985
明白了那一切
understood that the ever that everything

365
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,695
可以工作，而不是我不在的地方
can work and there isn't where I'm not

366
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,475
达成矛盾，这是我的
reaching a contradiction and here's my

367
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,705
思维
thinking

368
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,075
所以这完全正确
so it's perfectly true that the

369
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,185
与你同在的特征值-或者也许
eigenvalue that goes with you - or maybe

370
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,435
我应该称他们为X-因为
I should be calling them X - because

371
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,825
通常我称之为特征向量x2
usually I call the eigenvectors x2 it's

372
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,825
完全正确的那个mu-那一个
perfectly true that mu - that that one

373
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:49,475
上升但是当它击中时会发生什么
goes up but what happens when it hits

374
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,285
当它达到λ1实际上是lambda
when it reaches lambda 1 actually lambda

375
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,295
1第一个特征值是保持不变
1 the first eigenvalue is staying put

376
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,305
因为它没有得到任何推动
because it's not getting any push from

377
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,405
这个但第二个特征值是
this but the second eigenvalue is

378
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,885
如此推动大小theta
getting a push of size theta so so what

379
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,075
当lambda2加上静音时发生
happens when mute when lambda 2 plus

380
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,585
mu2u2的theta是lambda2plus
theta which is mu 2 u 2 is lambda 2 plus

381
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,005
theta什么时候会发生什么
theta what happens when it comes up to

382
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,955
lambda1和我开始担心它
lambda 1 and I start worrying that it

383
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,045
通过lambda1你会看到发生了什么
passes lambda 1 you see what's happening

384
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:25,535
当mu2通过时会发生什么
there what happens when mu 2 passes when

385
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,485
mu2这是我要复制的
mu 2 which is I'm just going to copy

386
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,155
这里是旧的lambda2加上相同的
here it's the old lambda 2 plus the same

387
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,155
作为一个数字，当theta得到时会发生什么
as a number what happens when theta gets

388
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,445
越来越大，这个
bigger and bigger and bigger and this

389
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,935
打这个东西，然后超越
hits this thing and then goes beyond

390
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,525
只是为了看到这里发生的逻辑
just to see the logic here what happens

391
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,245
是这个lambda2加上theta哪个
is that this lambda 2 plus theta which

392
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,175
是2亩2，直到他们到了这里
was mu 2 mu 2 until they've got here but

393
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,205
什么是lambda2加上theta之后
what is lambda 2 plus theta after it

394
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:59,345
现在它将lambda1传递给lambda1
passes lambda 1 its lambda 1 now it

395
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,925
这是它的最高特征值
passed up so it's the top eigenvalue of

396
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,845
改变的矩阵和
the of the of the altered matrix and

397
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,985
因此它就好了，就在这里
therefore it's just fine it's out here

398
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,115
没问题，是的
no problem yeah

399
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,775
或许我会再当时说
maybe I'll just say it again when when

400
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,955
theta足够大，mu2到达
theta is big enough that mu 2 reaches

401
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,015
lambda1如果我增加theta超过那个
lambda 1 if I increase theta beyond that

402
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,155
那么这不再是mu2了，但是你
then this becomes not mu 2 anymore but u

403
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,505
1然后完全让每个人都开心
1 and then totally everybody's happy

404
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,635
好吧，我只是不会就此而言
okay I'll just I won't say more on that

405
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,445
因为那只是像一个办法
because that's just like a way for that

406
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,235
我发现让我沉溺于这些
I found to make me sink what do these

407
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,385
事情的意思还可以
things mean okay enough said on that

408
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,955
小点，但接下来的主要观点是
small point but then the main point is

409
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,395
为什么这是真的
why is this true

410
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,585
这是隔行扫描，真的很棒
it's interlacing which is really a nice

411
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:01,715
美丽的事实，你可以想象
beautiful fact and you could imagine

412
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,685
我们有更多不同
that we have more different

413
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,135
扰动而不仅仅是排序
perturbations than just rank ones so

414
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,705
假设是的，所以让我告诉你
suppose yeah so so let me tell you the

415
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:20,435
以他们命名的不平等
the inequality so named after they

416
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:28,145
发现小瓶不平等所以他的
discover vials inequality so his

417
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,495
不等式是s的特征值
inequality is for the eigenvalues of s

418
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:40,505
加上T和我想啊所以T是
plus T and I want to yeah so T is the

419
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,445
改变S，我开始有
change s is where I start it has

420
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,655
特征值lambda但现在我正在寻找
eigenvalues lambda but now I'm looking

421
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,205
在S加特征的特征值所以我是
at the eigenvalues of s plus T so so I'm

422
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,605
在这里和我的改变
making a change in over here and my

423
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,785
这是十几岁的小它谜题
little puzzle question that was teens it

424
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,635
现在我可以允许，这是一个排名改变
was a rank one change now I could allow

425
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,875
其他等级还行，所以我想估计一下
other ranks okay so I want to estimate

426
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,715
就lambda而言，s加上t的lambda
lambdas of s plus T in terms of lambdas

427
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,815
T和我的lambdas和我想要一些
of s and lambdas of T and I want some

428
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,885
那里的不平等标志和它的假设
inequality sign there and it's supposed

429
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,265
对于任何对称矩阵都是如此
to be true for any symmetric matrices

430
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:28,385
对称smt然后完全完全
symmetric smt and then a totally totally

431
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,975
相同的小提琴平等实际上是viol
identical violin equality actually viol

432
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,475
是发现的人之一
was one of the people who discovered

433
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,235
看到欧拉的价值观，当他做到了
seen Euler values and when he did it he

434
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,385
询问他的不平等，他发现了
asked about his inequality and he found

435
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,545
它仍然按照我们发现的方式工作
that it still worked the way we found

436
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,115
今天早上它说了什么
this morning earlier that it said what

437
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,915
我不知道我还没完成
I'm what I haven't I haven't completed

438
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,225
那是因为我没有告诉你
that yet because I haven't told you

439
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,965
我正在谈论哪些lambdas
which lambdas I'm talking about

440
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:59,235
对，所以让我这样做，现在告诉你
right so let me do that so now tell your

441
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,895
文件不等，所以S＆T或对称和
files inequality so S&T or symmetric and

442
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,585
所以lambdas是真实的，我们想要
so the lambdas are real and we want to

443
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,365
我们知道我们想让他们整理好
know we want to get them in order okay

444
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,735
所以在这里
so here it goes

445
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,115
我要到这里来，我要提交
I'm going to over here I'm gonna file

446
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,055
大声朗读了s的冰特征值
aloud the ice eigenvalue of s and the

447
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,445
吨的JSON值，并计算出该
json value of t and figured out that

448
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:28,215
这是由S的特征值建立的
this was founded by that eigenvalue of S

449
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,805
加上T这是最糟糕的不平等
Plus T so that's vilest great inequality

450
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:39,765
这减少到我写的那个
which reduces to the the the one I wrote

451
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,985
在这里如果我做出正确的选择是的
here if I make the right choice yeah

452
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,135
可能如果我把J等于一等那么
probably if I take J equal to one so so

453
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,315
这是你看到它的美丽
this was you see the beauty of this it

454
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,455
告诉你有关的所有任何特征值
tells you about all any eigen values of

455
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,235
T的特征值所以我使用lambdas
s eigen values of T so I'm using lambdas

456
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,505
这里S的拉姆达是的特征值
here lambda of s are the eigenvalues of

457
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,205
我再次使用lambda作为T和
s I'm using lambda again for T and

458
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,175
lambda再次为s加T所以就是这样
lambda again for s plus T so it's that

459
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,485
你要注意哪个
you have to pay attention to which

460
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,455
矩阵我走的如此的特征值
matrix I'm taking the eigen values of so

461
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,105
让我把J等于一个然后这个
let me take J equal to one then this

462
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:22,155
说lambdaI因为J是1s加
says that lambda I because J is 1 s plus

463
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,765
T加R等于s的lambdaI加上lambda
T plus R equal lambda I of s plus lambda

464
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,225
1这是T的顶部本征值
1 the top eigen value of T this is

465
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:39,205
lambdamaxofT.
lambda max of T

466
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,365
你看到那是完全的吗？
do you see that that's totally

467
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,515
合理可信的
reasonable believable that the

468
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,174
当我加上Tlet时的特征值
eigenvalues when I add on T let's

469
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:51,695
在我们的脑海中想象T是积极的
imagine in our minds that T is positive

470
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,985
T是T就是这样这件事情，这是
T is T is like this this thing this is

471
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,705
这可能是茶的T例子
the this could be the T example of a tea

472
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,735
这就是我正在添加的内容
it's what I'm adding on then the

473
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:08,605
特征值上升但它们没有通过
eigenvalues go up but they don't pass

474
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,405
这样就可以告诉你它能做多少
that so that tells you how much it could

475
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,725
上升，所以我猜我猜
go up by so I guess that I guess that

476
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,705
小瓶告诉我们给了我们更少
vial is telling us is giving us a less

477
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,174
或者等于或小于lambda1
or equal here less or equal to lambda1

478
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:28,255
所以我带我去1加theta耶
so I'm taking I to be 1 plus theta yeah

479
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,435
是啊
yeah

480
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,054
所以我写下了不平等
so that inequality I've written down

481
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:34,945
那里有一些游戏要做
there there's some playing around to do

482
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,085
所以要练习并不是这样
so to get practice and it's not so

483
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,235
我们必须像世界一样
essential for us to be like world

484
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,535
除了你，这件事的大师们
grandmasters at this thing but you

485
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,565
应该看到它，你也应该看到J.
should see it and you should also see J

486
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,755
等于2y将J等于2告诉我们
equal to 2y will J equal to 2 tell us

487
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,655
我希望它会让我们看到什么
something I hope it will let's see what

488
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,875
它告诉我们lambdaI加1现在J是2
it tells us lambda I plus 1 now J is 2

489
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,815
小号加t，因此它是一个小于或
of S Plus T so it's a is less than or

490
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:16,794
等于λ的s加上TI的lambda2
equal lambda I of s plus lambda 2 of T I

491
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,924
认为这很有趣，或者也是
think that's interesting or and and also

492
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:27,835
我可以接受，我想我也可以得到
I could take I think I also could get

493
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,505
lambdaI加上我减1，所以这些让我
lambda I plus I minus 1 so these let me

494
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,755
写下来，看看它是否正确加
write it and see if it's correct plus

495
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,945
lambda我减1，所以加起来
lambda I minus 1 so that was added up to

496
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,515
我加2是啊我猜lambda加1
I plus 2 yeah I guess lambda I plus 1

497
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,055
再加上lambda的一颗牙齿
plus lambda one of teeth

498
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:56,565
是啊，这就是我通过采取做呀
yeah that's what I got by taking yeah do

499
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:02,385
那是对的，我把J等于一
that right I'm taking J equal to one

500
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:07,215
哦，我不认为我得到了它
oh well did I I don't think I got it

501
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,525
对，我想在这里做什么
right what am what do I want to do here

502
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,985
得到一个关于lambdaI加一个我的约束
to get a bound on lambda I plus one I

503
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,975
我想把J等于2我应该
want to take J equal to 2 I should just

504
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:23,595
要明智并插入等于2和我
be sensible and plug in a equals 2 and I

505
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:32,535
所有我想说的就是viols
equal 1 all I want to say is that viols

506
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,745
不平等是伟大的事实出来的
inequality is the great fact out of

507
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,055
所有这些交织的瀑布和
which all this interlacing Falls and

508
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,565
越来越多，因为隔行扫描是
more and more because the interlacing is

509
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,665
告诉我有关邻居的事实
telling me about neighbors and actually

510
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,185
如果我使用卑鄙的和我和J
if I use vile for a and I and J

511
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,135
不同的眼睛和J我甚至学习
different eyes and J's I even learn

512
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,925
关于那些不是邻居但是
about ones that are not neighbors but

513
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,175
我可以告诉你一个Vile的证据
and I could tell you a proof of Vile's

514
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,845
不平等，但我会为此保存
inequality but I'll save that for the

515
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:08,475
注意是的好，所以我想也许就是这样
notes yes okay so I think maybe that's

516
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,695
关于隔行扫描我想做什么
what I want to do about interlacing just

517
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,685
只是说说什么，但没有
just to say what the notes have but not

518
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,315
在课堂上重复这一切，所以笔记有
repeat it all in class so the notes have

519
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,915
实际上有两种方法来证明这一点
actually two ways to prove this

520
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,195
隔行扫描每一个标准的方式
interlacing the standard way that every

521
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,515
数学家会使用Vile的
mathematician would use would be Vile's

522
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,585
不平等，但亲爱的教授饶
inequality but less dear professor Rao

523
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:40,185
来访发现了一个不错的论点
visiting found a nice argument that's

524
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,855
它也以音符结尾
also in the notes it ends up with a

525
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,345
图和上图可以看出，
graph and on that graph you can see that

526
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:51,545
这是真的，所以它值得两个
this is true so for what it's worth two

527
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,795
这种隔行扫描的方法
approaches to this to this interlacing

528
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,235
和一些例子，但我真的没有
and some examples but I really don't

529
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,585
想花
want to spend

530
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,674
我们的生活在那个直升机上
our lives on that chopper this

531
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,705
特征值主题它是一个美丽的
eigenvalue topic it's it's a beautiful

532
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,225
关于对称矩阵和对偶矩阵的事实
fact about symmetric matrices and the

533
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,475
相应的事实是真实的
the corresponding fact is true for

534
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,775
任何矩阵的奇异值，但让我们
singular values of any matrix but let's

535
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:21,525
我想现在就把它留在那里好吧
I think of leaving it there okay so now

536
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:28,695
我正在继续他们新的部分
I'm moving on to their new section the

537
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,705
新节涉及一些事情
new section involves something called

538
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,654
压缩传感我不知道是否
compressed sensing I don't know if

539
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:46,455
你已经听过这些话了
you've heard those words so these are

540
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,064
您在第4.4节中的所有主题
all topics in Section 4.4 which you have

541
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:55,334
从我认为我们送出来十天前
from I think we send it out ten days ago

542
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:02,354
可能没关系所以首先让我记住
probably okay so first let me remember

543
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:06,435
什么核标准是一个矩阵的
what the nuclear norm is of a matrix the

544
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:15,245
矩阵的核范数的总和
nuclear norm of a matrix is the sum of

545
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,415
奇异值有一些
the singular values there's some of the

546
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:28,005
奇异值，所以它就像l1规范
singular values so it's like the l1 norm

547
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,495
对于一个正确的思考方式的向量
for a vector that's a right way to think

548
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,344
关于它，你还记得那是什么
about it and do you remember what was

549
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:37,185
我们特别谈到了使用方法
special we we've talked about the using

550
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,515
l1规范它有这个特殊的特殊性
the l1 norm it has this special special

551
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,945
普通l2规范的财产
property that the ordinary l2 norm

552
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,675
绝对没有它是什么
absolutely does not have what was it

553
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,285
如果我这么特别关于地狱的常态
special about the hell one norm if I

554
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,854
尽量减少一些尽量减少与l1范
minimize some minimize the l1 norm with

555
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:56,055
E有一些约束，比如axaV等于
E with some constraint like ax a V equal

556
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,015
B解决方案有什么特别之处
B what's special about the solution the

557
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,824
最小的l1范数稀疏权利
minimum in the l1 norm sparse right

558
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:08,475
稀疏，所以这让我们两个
sparse so this is moving us up two

559
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,834
矩阵和压缩的地方
matrices and that's where compressed

560
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,505
传感来自矩阵
sensing comes in matrix come

561
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,745
利森进来这里矩阵
Leeson comes in so here matrix

562
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,155
完成只是我提到的
completion would just be I mentioned so

563
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,165
这是完成，我会记住
this is completion and I'll remember the

564
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,495
Netflix这个问题就出现了
words Netflix which made the problem

565
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:42,125
着名，所以我有矩阵3-2
famous so I have the matrix a 3-2

566
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,145
问号问号
question mark question mark question

567
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:53,715
标记一个四个问题一个丢失
mark one four six question one missing

568
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,605
数据，所以我必须投入一些东西
data and so I have to put in something

569
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,355
因为如果我没有投入任何东西
there because if I don't put in anything

570
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,005
然后我不知道的数字是
then the numbers I have dunno are

571
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,365
没用，因为我不知道排和不
useless as I can't know row and no

572
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:11,625
列已完成，所以我们只是给
column is complete so we just would give

573
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,025
有人给我发了三个数据
up somebody that sent me the data three

574
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,165
和两个并没有出售告诉我一个
and two and didn't sell tell me a

575
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,475
我必须排名第三部电影
ranking for the third movie I'd have to

576
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,035
说得好我不能用它
say well I can't use it

577
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,455
这是不可能的，所以我们需要思考
that's not possible so we need to think

578
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:31,965
关于那里和想法是
about there and the idea is that the

579
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,735
最小化核规范的数字
numbers that minimize the nuclear norm

580
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,245
是一个不错的选择不错的选择等等
are a good choice a good choice so

581
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,705
这只是一个连接在这里，我们将
that's just a connection here that we'll

582
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,695
多谈谈，但不是没有，我们可以有
say more about but not not we could have

583
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,275
整个过程压缩传感a
a whole course compressed sensing a

584
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,205
核规范
nuclear norm

585
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,445
Perillo教授当然还有
professor Perillo and and of course in

586
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,295
当然六个六等于这方面的专家
six of course six is an expert on this

587
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:06,155
但问题是，你看到的点
but the point is you see the point that

588
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:15,735
那么你还记得什么是VV
so what is the you remember V V one came

589
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:21,045
从零北
from the zero north

590
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,955
什么是向量的零范数
and what is the zero norm of a vector

591
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,565
好吧，这不是一个常态，所以你可以说
well it's not a norm so you could say

592
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,775
忘记它不是没有答案，但我们做什么
forget it no no answer but what do we

593
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,835
象征意味着我写零
symbolically mean when I write the zero

594
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,235
向量的范数我的意思是数量
norm of a vector I mean the number of

595
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,785
非零非零的数量
non-zeros the number of non-zeros

596
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,905
这是非零的数量
this was the number of non zero in the

597
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:59,295
主要事件，但它不是一个常态，因为
main event but it's not a norm because

598
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,915
如果我拿两次我的矢量
if I take two times the vector I have

599
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,395
相同数量的非零相同的规范我
the same number of non-zeros same norm I

600
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,345
不能有两个V等于的标准
can't have the norm of two V equal to

601
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,615
电子商务的规范，即，这将吹走
norm of e that that that would blow away

602
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,905
规范的所有属性，所以V为零
all the properties of norms so V zero is

603
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,335
不是常态，我们把它移到那种
not a norm and we move it to the sort of

604
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,355
适当的最接近的标准，我们得到V1
appropriate nearest norm and we get V 1

605
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,325
我们得到L1范数，它是和的总和
we get the L 1 norm which is the sum of

606
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,935
每个人都记得这就是
the everybody remembers that this is the

607
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,555
V的总和，你记得我的
sum of the V on and you remember my

608
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:39,255
钻石触及飞机的图片
pictures of diamonds touching planes at

609
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,275
尖锐的是，这是正在发生的事情
sharp point well that's what's going on

610
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,115
这里的问题被称为基础
here that problem was called basis

611
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,105
追求又回来了
pursuit and comes back again in this

612
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:58,145
部分确定，但所以我最小化这个规范
section ok but so I minimize this norm

613
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,875
受条件限制好了我现在
subject to the conditions okay now I'm

614
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,155
只是要采取跳转到矩阵
just going to take a jump to the matrix

615
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,755
案件我的想法在这里我的想法是什么
case what's my idea here my idea is that

616
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,685
核规范的矩阵来了
the for matrix the nuclear norm comes

617
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:20,265
从什么是我们排序的标准
from what what's the norm that we sort

618
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,645
一开始，但这不是常态
of start with but it's not a norm and

619
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,535
当我有点像我那样
when I sort of take the I sort of

620
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,845
因为三角不等式或
because of triangle inequality or the

621
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,125
对规范的要求不会让他们失望
requirements for a norm don't fail they

622
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,945
失败了
fail for what

623
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,055
我准备在那里写我可以放一个
I'm about to write there I could put a

624
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,594
零，但我不希望数量
zero but I don't want the number of

625
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,475
非零的条目，这将是一个很好的
nonzero entries that would be a good

626
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,045
猜测，可能在某种意义上说它
guess and probably in some sense it make

627
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,535
它是有道理的，但它不是答案
it make sense but it's not the answer

628
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,145
我在找
I'm looking for

629
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,435
你认为什么是零的标准？
what do you think is the zero norm of a

630
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,735
矩阵，这不是一个规范，但何时
matrix that that is not a norm but when

631
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,795
我把它抽到最近的地方
I pump it up to the best to the nearest

632
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,875
好的规范我按顺序获得核
good norm I get the nuclear in order so

633
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,215
所以这就是问题是什么
so this is the question is what is a

634
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:25,074
零是什么级别的军衔
zero what the rank the rank of the

635
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,495
矩阵是等效是在IS
matrix is is the equivalent is the is

636
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,594
这是我不知道的
the is the so I don't know about the

637
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,875
零没有人要求在零，所以我
zero nobody else calls at a zero so I

638
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,745
更好的不是它的排名所以再次
better not it's the rank so again the

639
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,965
排名不是常态，因为如果我加倍
rank is not a norm because if I double

640
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,955
矩阵我没有加倍排名但是
the matrix I don't double the rank but

641
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,415
如果是的话我要搬到一个规范，它
if so I have to move to a norm and it

642
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,755
结果证明是现在的核规范
turns out to be the nuclear norm and now

643
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,084
我只想一分钟说这是猜测
I'll just one minute say it's the guess

644
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:57,955
有些人正在努力工作
of some people who are working hard to

645
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,505
证明这是深刻的学习
prove it that the deep learning

646
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,405
梯度下降算法找到了
algorithm of gradient descent finds the

647
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,854
溶液在最小问题
solution to the minimum problem in the

648
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,705
核规范，我不知道
nuclear norm and I don't we don't know

649
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,844
如果那是真的
if that's true or not

650
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,834
是的，我们是第一个小相关的
yeah we're first small for for related

651
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:26,114
像这样的东西它被证明是例子
examples like this thing it's proved for

652
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:29,455
这是深度学习的确切问题
the exact problem of deep learning it's

653
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,765
这是一个猜想没关系
it's a conjecture okay

654
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,824
所以这是在四四节
so that's what's in Section four four

655
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:37,675
但是你想要的那个单词套索
but other that word lasso you want to

656
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,445
知道什么是压缩传感
know what that is compressed sensing

657
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,755
我会说一个关于这样的话
I'll say a word about so that will be

658
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,535
AlexTownsend演讲结束后的星期一
Monday after Alex Townsend's lecture

659
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,775
星期五所以他要来发言了
Friday so he's he's coming to speak

660
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,705
-计算科学专业的学生
- computational science students all

661
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,885
麻省理工学院明天下午我会
over MIT tomorrow afternoon I'll

662
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,354
当然可以去那，但他说他
certainly go to that but then he said he

663
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:03,505
会进来，并借此类星期五
would come in and take this class Friday

664
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,180
so I'll see you Friday

665
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:08,930
所以我星期五见

666
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,930
他会在这里-好的
and he'll be here - okay
