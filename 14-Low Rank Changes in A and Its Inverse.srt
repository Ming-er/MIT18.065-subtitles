低阶矩阵如此重要的功能
low rank matrices so important function

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,665
矩阵他们可以真正低等级
matrices they can be truly low rank like

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,145
紫外线转置是排名第一和我们
UV transpose that's a rank one and we

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,705
对那些问题有一些疑问
have some questions about those and then

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,225
本章后面将讨论矩阵
later in the chapter will meet matrices

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,285
虽然排名在哪里
that are approximately though rank where

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,725
奇异值就像下降一样
the the singular values drop off like

16
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,974
疯了，那些非常了不起
crazy and those are quite remarkable

17
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,665
矩阵确定，这是我的话题
matrices ok so that this is my topic at

18
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,465
一开始，如果不采取
the beginning and it if it doesn't take

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,985
整整一个小时我想回去
the whole hour I want to go back to a

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,165
第2章第2章中的主题
topic in in chapter chapter 2 that

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,915
应该是2.4，我们是最后一次
should be 2.4 where we were last time

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,415
好的，所以这是在一小时后期
good ok so that's for late in the hour

23
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,525
这是现在所以我希望它让我们专注
this is for now so I want it let's focus

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,065
对此我有什么问题
on this so what's the question there I

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,695
从身份矩阵Iperturb开始
start with the identity matrix I perturb

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,815
它通过排名1的矩阵，我问什么
it by a matrix of rank 1 and I ask what

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,375
反之亦然，我正在做一个小事
the inverse is so I'm making a small

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,864
当我说小时改变矩阵
change in the matrix when I say small

29
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,085
改变我不是说数字是
change I don't mean that the numbers are

30
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,004
事实上，你知道它可以紫外线
small in fact you know it could UV

31
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,885
转置可能是所有的女主人
transpose could be the all ones matron

32
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,785
或者所有的数百万甚至矩阵，但它
or all Millions matrix even but it's

33
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,874
等级很小就是那个
rank is small that's what's that's the

34
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,785
小这种想法是很重要的位置，并
idea of small that's important here and

35
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,904
我想知道反面是什么
I would like to know what the inverse is

36
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:32,055
这就是4.1和4.1中的问题
so that's the question here in 4.1 and

37
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,025
有一个着名的公式，有
there's a famous formula that has at

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,505
至少三个名字，可能更多和
least three names and probably more and

39
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,755
它也被称为矩阵求逆
it's also called the matrix inversion

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:54,704
信号处理中的公式让我
formula in signal processing and let me

41
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,615
记下这个例子，所以我开始吧
write down the example so here I start

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,165
使用单位矩阵我排名1
with the identity matrix I do a rank 1

43
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,835
扰动，我想知道是什么
perturbation and I want to know what's

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,564
反过来，我会写下来的
the inverse and I'll write down the

45
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,885
回答并检查它是否是正确的那么
answer and check that it's correct so

46
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,764
我正在扰乱身份矩阵
i'm perturbing the identity matrix in

47
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,245
这种情况的逆也是
this case whose inverse is also the

48
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,104
单位矩阵所以我要写
identity matrix so I'm going to write

49
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,704
作为一种排列的答案
the answer as a as a permutation as a

50
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,764
我和这个问题的扰动是
perturbation of I and the question is

51
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,064
什么是扰动，它是一个
what is that perturbation and it's a

52
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:34,505
着名的配方有一个UV转置
famous formula there's a UV transpose

53
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,294
从那里复制除以1
comes in copied from there divided by 1

54
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:47,204
减去vtransposeu现在让我们先来
minus v transpose u now let's first of

55
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,395
所有这些只是看到这些是一个
all just see that these are this is a

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,314
合理的配方，所以使用列U和
reasonable formula so use a column U and

57
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,634
V是列向量，因为UV总是如此
V are column vectors as always so UV

58
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,775
transpose是一列矩阵列
transpose is a matrix column times row

59
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,475
所以我从中减去了
so I it's being subtracted from the

60
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,764
身份和这边我在这边
identity and over here on this side I

61
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,884
将UV转置再次排名第一
have UV transpose again a rank one

62
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,755
矩阵除以数字，这就是
matrix divided by a number so that's the

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,104
指出这是一个数字
point this is a number

64
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:28,724
一个接一个矩阵，你可以这样说
a one by one matrix you could say so the

65
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,594
这个公式的要点就是找到了
point of this formula is to find the

66
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:36,134
N乘n矩阵的逆
inverse of an N by n matrix in terms of

67
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,914
1乘1矩阵的逆矩阵
the inverse of a 1 by 1 matrix which is

68
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,974
我的意思是更简单，更容易做到
a lot simpler and easier to do I mean

69
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,184
右手边显然很容易
that right hand side is clearly easy and

70
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:50,284
让我们看看它告诉我们的其他事情
let's see what other things it tells us

71
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:55,064
所以这是一个秩1扰动
so this was a Rank 1 perturbation in the

72
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:59,355
身份然后，当我反转，我得看看
identity then when I invert I get look

73
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,904
在此这也是1级，这是一个
at this this is also a rank 1 that's a

74
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,235
这其实数量是非常相同的
number that's in fact it's the very same

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,805
等级1，我们在这个有没有在这
rank 1 that we had there in this in this

76
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:17,534
好的情况如此结论，如果我改变你的
nice case so conclusion if I change your

77
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,675
矩阵按等级1改变它的倒数
matrix by rank 1 I change its inverse by

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,024
排名第一，似乎并不完全
rank one that doesn't seem completely

79
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,344
很明显，直到你弄明白
obvious until you go to figure it out

80
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,105
当你搞清楚时，你会得到一个公式
when you figure it out you get a formula

81
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,034
到目前为止，我告诉你的是我
that tells you well so far what I'm

82
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,955
扰动是我的身份矩阵
perturbing is the identity matrix when I

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,495
到达这里我会扰乱任何矩阵
get here I'm gonna perturb any matrix

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,355
如果，我会得出同样的结论
I'm gonna reach the same conclusion if

85
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,524
这是排名1然后是变化
this is rank 1 then the change in the

86
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:54,524
逆也是排名1，但让我们看看它
inverse is also rank 1 but let's see it

87
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,964
第一个平等的身份，所以我
first for a equal the identity so I

88
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,694
我猜我有两三个问题
guess I have two or three questions one

89
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,914
将如何检查这是什么
would be how do you check that this is

90
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:11,765
再次纠正，记住它在做什么
correct again remember what it's doing

91
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,265
它的漂亮整洁是它的计算
it's pretty neat it's it's computing an

92
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,874
N乘以1乘以1乘以1
N by n inverse in terms of a 1 by 1

93
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,185
反过来我只是一个数字而且那就是
inverse I just it's a number and that's

94
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,825
这肯定是一个有利的交流所以它是
a certainly a favorable exchange so it's

95
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,524
你想要的公式和a
a formula that you want and and a

96
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:34,164
这个公式非常有用
formula that's quite useful

97
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,814
是的，让我看看公式
yeah let me just check the formula

98
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:40,175
在我谈论它如何有用之前
before I talk about how how it's useful

99
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,504
所以如何检查它我猜是否这样
so how shall I check it I guess if this

100
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,605
声称是逆，然后让我们
is claimed to be the inverse then let's

101
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,384
只是检查所以这将是检查
just check so this will be the check

102
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:58,625
我将乘以我加上UV
I'll multiply by by that I plus UV

103
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,585
转换一个减去V转置你
transpose over one minus V transpose you

104
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,064
声称的反转和我希望的是什么
the claimed inverse and what am i hoping

105
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:11,435
从这个乘法得到我，我
to get from this multiplication I I'm

106
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,254
想知道我希望那个结果是
wondering I'm hoping that that result is

107
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,925
身份矩阵所以我要去
the identity matrix so I'm just going to

108
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,835
做到这一点我们会看到身份
do it out and we'll see the identity

109
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,164
出现让我这么快就让我这么做
appear so that times I so let me just

110
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,015
先写下那部分我减去紫外线
write that part first I minus UV

111
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,185
转置，现在我减去UV转置
transpose and now I minus UV transpose

112
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,034
这是为了减去紫外线
times this so that's I minus UV

113
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,754
转置xUV转置超过一个减号
transpose x UV transpose over one minus

114
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,455
V转置你就是这样
V transpose u that's it's just just

115
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,694
将它乘以看到我们
multiplying it out and seeing that we

116
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:55,504
得到身份好吧我看到了身份
get the identity okay I see the identity

117
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,884
所以我想我希望这一切
there so I guess I hope that all this

118
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,904
这部分减少到它减少了什么
this part reduces to what does it reduce

119
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:09,605
好吧，让我在那里做那个分子
to okay let me do that numerator there

120
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:19,145
所以这是UV转置减去upoo减去
so that's UV transpose minus u poo minus

121
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,464
u次V转置你看到了什么
u times V transpose u do you see what's

122
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:30,904
发生在这里V转置关键是
happening here V transpose the key is

123
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:35,094
当我乘以那个倍数时
that when I multiplied that times that

124
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,164
我连续做了四件事，而且我做了
I've got four things in a row and I do

125
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,074
中间对首先因为那是一个
the middle pair first because that's a

126
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,255
数字V转置你所以我有紫外线
number V transpose u so I had UV

127
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,705
转移从那
transpose from that

128
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,695
和UV转置次数-数量
and UV transpose times that number - do

129
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,555
你知道我在这里得到了什么
you see what have I got here I've got

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,375
我已经知道了，我现在已经进行了紫外线转换
I've got ya I've got UV transpose I now

131
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,945
我将1-v转置因子分解出来
i factor out a 1 - v transpose u which

132
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,905
正是我想要的这是一个因素
is just what I want this is a factor

133
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,065
然后1减V将你移出这里
then 1 minus V transpose u out of here

134
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,755
它取消了那些然后我就是
it's there cancel those and then I'm

135
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,265
留下一个取消的UV转置
left with a UV transpose which cancels

136
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,945
那并留下了它的亲切身份
that and leaves the identity it's kind

137
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,885
魔术当然是有人拥有的
of magic of course it was somebody had

138
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,535
在第一个中找出那个公式
to figure out that formula in the first

139
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:37,045
地方我可以，我可以做下一个，如果
place I could I could do the next one if

140
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,885
你喜欢，因为我在滚动
you like since I'm on a roll

141
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,315
假设我现在采取第二个是什么
suppose I take the second one now what's

142
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,705
它的紫外转置的差异，但
the difference in its UV transpose but

143
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,315
那些较大字母在U和V
those are larger letters the U and the V

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,245
那么如果我的意思是那些呢？
so what if one of my meaning by those

145
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,315
那些是矩阵，是的，这是一个更大的
those are matrices yeah this is a bigger

146
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,385
等级U是U是有K列V.
rank U is a U is a has K columns V

147
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,555
转置有K行他们产品
transpose has K rows they that product

148
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,495
UV转置是KbyK所以让我看看
UV transpose is K by K so let me see

149
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,255
我认为这个公式现在会如此
what I think the formula would be so now

150
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,015
我减去UV转置，所以这是
I minus UV transpose inverse so this is

151
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:30,355
n乘以K乘以K乘以n得到n乘以n
n by K times K by n so it's n by n

152
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,875
矩阵，这是想法的身份
matrix and this is the idea identities

153
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,675
但它的等级是什么等级
but it's rank is what is the rank of

154
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,645
现在好了正确的，所以我在这里
that now okay right so I have here the

155
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,675
整件事就是整件事
whole thing is the whole thing is the

156
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,915
N乘n矩阵的逆，所以我有一个
inverse of an N by n matrix so I have an

157
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,645
Nbynmatrix让我把它放在这里n
N by n matrix let me put that up here n

158
00:10:52,650 --> 00:11:01,435
通过n矩阵反转
by n matrix to invert

159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,685
还有它是好的，我会写下来
there it is okay I'm gonna write down

160
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,425
你能够达到的公式
the formula you're gonna be able to

161
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,465
写下来，因为它只是复制
write it down because it's just copy

162
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,235
从那个复制，你会看到
copied from that one and you'll see that

163
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,805
它涉及KbyKinverse，所以我有
it involves a K by K inverse so I have

164
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,384
N×n矩阵反转，但我没有
an N by n matrix to invert but I don't

165
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,235
必须这样做我可以把它切换到K.
have to do that I can switch it to a K

166
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,795
通过K矩阵，这很漂亮没关系
by K matrix that's like pretty nice okay

167
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,524
所以我们这样做吧
so so let's do it

168
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,535
所以我基本上要复制我加
so I'm basically gonna copy that I plus

169
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,715
你现在我是矩阵所以我就是这样的
you now I'm matrices so I I so that's an

170
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,024
逆，但我不能把它作为一个
inverse but I can't leave it as a

171
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,795
分母，因为我们在这里
denominator because we're here we're

172
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,465
谈到由K矩阵AK，这是
talking about a K by K matrix this is

173
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,995
现在这很好，所以我必须这样做
this is now this is well so I have to

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,564
把它像任何矩阵逆IK减去
put it like any matrix inverse I K minus

175
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:06,545
V转置你反转所以我只是
V transpose u inverse so I'm just

176
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,574
明智地复制这个公式
copying this formula wisely taking the

177
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,274
你首先要比这个部分好
you first than this part and then

178
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:19,204
最后V转置我把这个
finally the V transpose I put this one

179
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,725
这一个现在已经成功了
up this one now has made that one

180
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,055
过时的右这是字母k等于
obsolete right this was the case k equal

181
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,365
一个在这里，但我认为它有助于
one over here but I think it helps to

182
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,345
看到这肯定有助于我看到
see it this certainly helps me to see

183
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,925
公式首先排名第一
the formula first for a rank one

184
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,965
扰动，非常非常
perturbation which is pretty much a very

185
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,694
可能的可能性，然后看到我们
likely possibility and then see that we

186
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:45,365
有我完全类似的公式应
have I totally analogous formula shall

187
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,024
我们这有点乐趣，以检查它，所以我
we it's sort of fun to check it so I

188
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,055
打算做同样的检查，但我会
plan to do the same check but but I'll

189
00:12:52,060 --> 00:13:02,615
请注意，我有一个KbyK所以
just notice here that I have a K by K so

190
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,324
我正在交换一些东西
I'm exchanging something that's a

191
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,684
n的身份和n的扰动
perturbation of I of n by n identity and

192
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:12,365
n由n矩阵表示必须反转
n by n matrix for to have to invert

193
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,024
什么是KbyK矩阵
something that's a K by K matrix

194
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,495
K的身份很多地扰乱了K.
perturbing the K by K identity much

195
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,285
在这种情况下，较小的是k就是一个
smaller in that case k was one so are

196
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,074
你现在好好检查它，所以我想要
you good for checking it now so I want

197
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,105
通过这个和多个多重我
to multiple multiple I that by this and

198
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,855
希望得到我是这个身份
hopefully get I am the identity this is

199
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:43,745
最后，我不是，我应该
the end by in I didn't yeah I should I

200
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,774
没有给予这两个或三个奖励
haven't given credit to the two or three

201
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,774
或者可能有11个人找到了
or four possibly 11 people who found

202
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:55,655
这个公式，我不明白哦，是的
this formula and I not see oh yeah here

203
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,495
是他们的名字
are their names

204
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,155
是不是好让他们通过著名
is it okay to make them famous by

205
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,324
把他们的名字放在这里是谢尔曼
putting their names up here yes Sherman

206
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:12,625
我无法告诉你是谁做了什么的
and I couldn't tell you who did what

207
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:18,515
莫里森伍德伯里
Morrison Woodbury

208
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,985
然后也许没人会怀疑别人
and then nobody doubt others right maybe

209
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,595
其中一人做了一个这样做排名
one of them did that one did this rank

210
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,025
一个案例，然后另一个案例
one case and then another generalized it

211
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,445
然后你可以从中看到
and then you could see from that from

212
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,865
那里的大纲最终我们会
the outline there that eventually we'll

213
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,265
我们当然可以扰乱矩阵
we can perturb a matrix a of course

214
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,425
那不会比那更难
that's not gonna be much harder than the

215
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,905
身份好吧让我们做一个
identity okay let's let's do just one

216
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,545
更多检查，然后显示它是如何
more check and then show how it could be

217
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,065
使用好吧好吧我乘以那个
used okay okay I multiply that by that

218
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,475
我们可以做到这这件事倍
can we do that this this thing times

219
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,785
这个并希望得到这样的身份
this and hope to get the identity so

220
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,115
首先，我会写下这件事
first I'll write down this thing there's

221
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,175
我不会平等的东西，因为我
something I won't put equal because I'm

222
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,595
不是我乘以那就好了
not I'm multiplying that by that okay so

223
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,825
我通过n减去UV转置
I get by n minus UV transpose on the

224
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,325
左边当然我得到了
left side of course I'm getting the

225
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,285
身份，我希望希望我得到
identity and I hope hoping I'm getting

226
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,025
在右边的身份所以我
the identity on the right so I'm

227
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,115
这个相乘我做到了，现在有我
multiplying by this I did it there now I

228
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,485
必须把我减去UV转置它
have to put I minus UV transpose it

229
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,805
在这里面对你我是负V
takes face here you I'm minus V

230
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:49,355
转置u逆V转置gulp所以
transpose u inverse V transpose gulp so

231
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,325
我只是留在那里，或者你就是你
I just leave it there or you're you're

232
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,815
午餐时你很坚强让我们看看我们是什么
at lunch you're strong let's see what we

233
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,685
可以做到还好这部分罚款好吧，这
can do okay this part fine okay this

234
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:08,525
部分哦，男孩我在这里做什么诀窍
part oh boy what do I do here the trick

235
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,965
是要成为这个不要看
is gonna be that this don't be looking

236
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,915
它可以写的东西
thing there it can be written

237
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,575
不同的是，让我们告诉我什么
differently well let's just tell me what

238
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,835
等于它等于你减去紫外线
it equals it equals u minus u v

239
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,944
颠倒
transpose

240
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:33,234
你写的每个人都看到了，但现在
you write everybody sees that but now

241
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:36,994
我要做什么我要把它放进去
what am I gonna do I'm gonna put the

242
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:42,624
括号不同
parentheses differently

243
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,634
我带来了你，你这是在
I'm bringing the you the you that was on

244
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,405
在那里，我会穿上它
the right up there I'm gonna put it on

245
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,394
左边你看到的就是这样
the left you see that so so this is

246
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,294
显然你减去UV转移你和
obviously you minus UV transpose you and

247
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,845
现在我要把另一个放在右边
now I'm going to put right at another

248
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,204
时间是你的时间我减去V转置
time it's you times I minus V transpose

249
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:05,465
你，我会把你从中分解出来
you I'm gonna factor that you out of on

250
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,745
左侧而不是它的位置
the left side instead of where it

251
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,634
最初来自右侧
originally came on the right side of

252
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:12,875
这没关系你怎么看好消息
this okay you see how see the great news

253
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,664
是的，这实际上是好的
there yeah this was actually well

254
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,644
由你的教授偶然组织
organized by your professor by accident

255
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:25,444
好吧那我现在该做什么呢
okay so what do I do now this thing look

256
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,725
我到底就是我所拥有的
I've got exactly here what I've got

257
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,435
完全倒在那里，我有我
inverted there so altogether I have I

258
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,695
减去UV转置加上你这个
minus UV transpose Plus this you this

259
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,784
取消时间V转置所以我得到了我
cancelled times V transpose so I get I

260
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:44,554
所以这只是这个小花招
so it was just this little sleight of

261
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,615
你右手进来的地方
hand where you came in on the right and

262
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,554
在左边出来没关系，是一个
came out on the left okay and be a

263
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,884
现在有类似的公式
similar formula with a in there so now

264
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:01,595
这是一个公平的问题，是怎么做的
it's a fair question how did anybody

265
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,144
想出这些公式，我们就是这样
come up with these formulas we're we're

266
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,215
通过检查证明它们是正确的
proving them correct just by checking

267
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,154
他们认同他们的身份
that they that they give the identity

268
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,524
矩阵我们应该如何思考
matrix we should really think how that

269
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,955
如何在第一个中找到公式
how to find the formula in the first

270
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,174
我可以回到这个地方怎么样
place I could go back to this one how

271
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,394
你能在第一个中找到那个公式吗？
could you find that formula in the first

272
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,875
放置好这里是应该做的一种方式
place well here's one way to do it

273
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:41,465
-所以-这是一个即将发现的
- so - - this is an about to discover

274
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,465
然后我在这里让我放过
and then I over here let me put over

275
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:57,165
我想到这里使用这个公式
here to use the formula while I think of

276
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,915
它实际上我有两个用于
it and actually I have two to uses in

277
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:13,005
心灵使用一个就是解决所以我只是
mind use one would be to solve so I just

278
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,095
做我想我想要这样这是我的
doing I suppose I want to so this is my

279
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,375
新矩阵UV转置x等于一些
new matrix UV transpose x equals some

280
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,795
右手边B解决了一个线性系统
right hand side B solve a linear system

281
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,215
其具有系数矩阵它们
that has that coefficient matrix they

282
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:41,255
过去常常会在广场上出现新的a
used to would be in the squares a new a

283
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,725
新的测量或观察或数据
new measurement or observation or data

284
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:57,075
指出这些方块所以我的意思
point in these squares so what I mean

285
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,505
那么旧的我是什么意思呢
well what do I mean by this the old

286
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:10,455
问题是X等于B，我在想
problem was a X equal B and I'm thinking

287
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,945
我说的是最小方块
what I'm talking about least squares

288
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,985
在这里，我想象一个是矩形的
here I'm imagining that a is rectangular

289
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,985
-许多方程式教导a是一个高大的罪
- many equations taught a is a tall sin

290
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,085
矩阵只是我们一直在谈论的那种
matrix just the kind we've been talking

291
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,195
关于这个等式成为
about so that that equation becomes of

292
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,355
当然我们知道我们正常了
course we know we go to the normal

293
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:37,665
方程式a转置X是好的X是
equations a transpose a X the good X is

294
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,154
转置B
a transpose B

295
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:48,424
好的，现在我们得到一个新的测量所以a
okay now we get a new measurement so a

296
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,224
新测量如何新
new measurement how does the new

297
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:52,414
测量改变了这个问题
measurement change the problem so this

298
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,694
是之前的老问题
is the old problem before the

299
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,914
测量现在是一个新的
measurement comes in now a new

300
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,074
测量到了，这是另一个B.
measurement arrived so that's another B

301
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:04,854
aBn加1，我们得到另一个等式
a B n plus 1 and we get another equation

302
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,834
我们得到另一个正确的方程式
we get another equation right that's the

303
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,044
新的测量一个新点的
new measurement a new point to that the

304
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,954
直线试图贴近
straight line is trying to stay close to

305
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:17,914
所以我们称这个等式我不知道
so so we call this equation I don't know

306
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,004
我们应该怎么称呼它也许就是它
what we should call it maybe it's it'll

307
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:26,944
多一个排所以现在老现在是
be one more row so now old now it's

308
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:30,904
变得新鲜我有点兴奋
becoming new I'm sort of more excited

309
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,944
关于这个，然后改善
about this then and improving the

310
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:37,564
公式所以还是会这么好吗
formula so just keep going so okay

311
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:40,774
有我们的M测量和存在
there's our M measurements and being

312
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:44,704
大的a是高大的薄矩阵和
large a being the tall thin matrix and

313
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,654
现在我们要再给它一排
now we're gonna give it one more row

314
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,754
我们要让它甚至更高的发言权
we're gonna make it even taller say

315
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:54,114
也许V转置时间与X相同
maybe V transpose times the same X is

316
00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:00,514
有些是新的或类似的东西，所以我们
some be new or something like that so we

317
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,394
所以再多一行了
so there's one more row one more

318
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:06,874
测量那么北方是什么
measurement so what's the north what

319
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:08,584
这是正常的等式
happens to the normal equation this is

320
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:11,435
这让你更有可能
this is makes it even more likely you

321
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,774
知道还有另外一点希望
know there's another point hoping the

322
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,634
直线将通过，但如果我们
straight line will go through but if we

323
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,734
再给它一点，甚至更少
give it one more point there's even less

324
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:20,974
直线前进的可能性
chance of a straight line going exactly

325
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:25,114
通过，但仍然是为什么这是我的
through but still so what why this is my

326
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,514
新矩阵所以我的新常态是什么
new matrix so what's my new normal

327
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:37,435
方程新的正规方程然后a
equation a new normal equation then a a

328
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,484
转置所以a有一个新的新的
transpose so a the a has got a new a new

329
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:47,224
row有一个新行，所以转置
row has got a new row so a transpose

330
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:49,174
将有一个我刚刚复制的新专栏
will have a new column I'm just copying

331
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,904
正常的等式，但我给它
the normal equation but I'm giving it

332
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:52,675
它的
its

333
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,195
新事物得到了一个新专栏，这是我的一个
new things got a new column this is my a

334
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:05,605
换了一排这是我最好的X帽子
with a new row this is my X hat my best

335
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,215
我最小的方块回答新的和a
my least squares answer new and a

336
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,925
transpose这是一个转置与
transpose is this a transpose with the

337
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:25,155
新的现在列时间b所以b和b新
new now column times b so b and b new

338
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,695
好吧相当好看这个
okay pretty okay with this to see that

339
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,645
这是新的正规方程式
this is the new normal equation i'm

340
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,375
使用新矩阵和新权利
using the new matrix and the new right

341
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,165
手边和另外一个数据点
hand side and just one more data point

342
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:45,115
已进入系统
has come into the into the system from

343
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,165
他们的传感器和关键点是什么
their sensor and what's the key point

344
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,685
这里的关键点是我不想
here key point is i don't want to

345
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,945
重新计算我不想乘以那个
recompute i don't want to multiply that

346
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,175
矩阵，我不想重新开始
matrix again i don't want to start over

347
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,085
我不想，我不想计算
I don't want to I don't want to compute

348
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,215
这是一个井II的转置时间
this a transpose times that a well I I

349
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,795
想要用我已经做过的事情
want to use what I've already done so

350
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,035
如果我成倍的是什么是什么
what is what is what is if I multiply

351
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,985
那两个在一起我实际上是什么
those two together what do I actually

352
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,035
得到这就是这是我正在添加一个新的
get so this is this is I'm adding a new

353
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,095
列在这里和新行在这里和我
column here and the new row here and I

354
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,645
告诉我你的想法是什么和答案
tell me what you think the answer is and

355
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,075
然后让我们看看为什么我问你
then let's just see why I'm asking you

356
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:38,535
什么那个矩阵是你怎么想的
what that matrix is what do you think

357
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,355
无论如何，让我知道如果
start me out to anyway they knew that if

358
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,545
我只是要求平凡
I just I'm just asking for ordinary

359
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,605
矩阵乘法很好我想我
matrix multiplication well I guess I'm

360
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,225
要求你按列行进行
asking you to do it columns times rows

361
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,035
因为那是1806五个专业
since that's what 1806 five specializes

362
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,215
因此，我认为我有那样的时间
in so I think I have that times that a

363
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,355
转置一个
transpose a

364
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,835
加上一个新列，一个nuRhoVV
plus one new column times one nu Rho VV

365
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,285
转置乘以这个Xhatnu
transpose is multiplying this X hat nu

366
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,045
我得到了正确的一面
and over on the right side I get

367
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,485
无论我有一个转置V老和
whatever I had the a transpose V old and

368
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:26,705
在V千伏新，但让我回来给
the V V new but let me come back to that

369
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,555
因为这真的告诉你为什么你
because that really shows you why you

370
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,555
必须理解矩阵乘法
must understand matrix multiplication

371
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,295
通常的行x列，但那
both the usual row x column but that

372
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,615
在这里也不会那么有吸引力
would not be so attractive here and also

373
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,475
列的时间为行的新方式
the new way as columns times rows

374
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,025
因为当我看到它作为列时间
because when I see it as columns times

375
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,995
行我看到我有相同的列
rows I see that I have the same columns

376
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,325
那里有相同的行，所以我就是我
and same rows there so I just what I

377
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,515
已经知道然后我有一个新的
already knew and then I have one new

378
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,915
列当然是一个新行
column times one new row of course

379
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,555
第n列加1，第n行
that's column n plus 1 and that's row n

380
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,815
再加1，他们给予等级1它是a
plus 1 and they give that rank 1 it's a

381
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,205
等级1在转置中改变它是a
rank 1 change in a transpose a it's a

382
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,565
等级1改变转置a这样
rank 1 change in a transpose a so this

383
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,885
就像最小正方形的一部分我
is like part of the of least squares I

384
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,235
意味着你可以看到一个相关性
mean you can see that the relevance in a

385
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,765
真正的问题，你可能有一个
real problem you you maybe have a

386
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,685
沿着你飞行的导弹送了一个
missile flying along you sent up a

387
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,655
您正在跟踪的卫星GPS卫星
satellite GPS satellite you're tracking

388
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,065
它只是在数据中输入更多数据
it more data comes in the data is just

389
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,145
跟踪器没有一个位置
one more position the tracker isn't

390
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,325
完美，所以我们在这里很适合我
perfect so we're gonna fit well here I'm

391
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:49,745
拟合直线也许我们就是
fitting a straight line maybe but we're

392
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,135
适合数据和唯一
fitting to the data and the the only

393
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,625
改变了左手的配偶
change in the mate in the left hand the

394
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,205
很大的问题，大部分的
big problem that the big part of the

395
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,965
计算是转置一个部分
computation is that a transpose a part

396
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,855
它只是按等级1或更改而改变
and it's just changed by rank 1 or by

397
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,415
如果我们有K个新数据点，则排名a
rank a if we had K new data points if we

398
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,295
有K个新的数据点然后这将是
had K new data points then this would be

399
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,155
一个雨洞
a rain cave

400
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,865
所以你看，然后我回到这里好吧
so you see then I go back here well okay

401
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,625
现在我正在扰乱a和我的转置
now I'm perturbing a transpose a and I

402
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,395
尚未给出那个公式
haven't given a formula for that one yet

403
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,925
到目前为止，我只是感到不安
I've only perturbed up to now the

404
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,535
身份，但你可以相信所有
identity but you can believe since all

405
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,535
谢尔曼，这些公式正在起作用
these formulas are working that Sherman

406
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,475
或莫里森或伍德伯里想出了
or Morrison or Woodbury came up with the

407
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,345
正确的置换扰动
correct permutation the perturbation for

408
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,835
一个转置，所以我很高兴
a transpose a so I'm sort of happy to

409
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,795
那个应用程序如此自然而然
that that application so natural came

410
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:59,865
如此简单，我就是那样的
out so simply well I'm on that sort of

411
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,895
你有没有听说过这个主题
subject have you ever heard of the

412
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,865
卡尔曼滤波器使牛仔过滤器
Kalman filter so the cowman filter

413
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:12,585
究竟是什么呢？
what's that about it's about exactly

414
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,675
这是关于它的动态平方
this it's about dynamically squares it's

415
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,535
关于最小二乘问题
about least squares problems in which

416
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,835
新数据即将出现，这是其中的一部分
new data is coming in that's a part a

417
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,205
卡尔曼滤波器或另一个词让我
Kalman filter or another word let me

418
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,485
在这里写几个字
just write a couple of words up here

419
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,935
这实际上是递归最小二乘法
this is really recursive least squares

420
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,865
递归最小二乘法我的意思
recursive least squares what I mean by

421
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,645
递归是新数据进来的
recursive is new data comes in it

422
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,635
改变答案，但不会改变
changes the answer but it doesn't change

423
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:53,715
我们的方法，然后卡尔曼滤波器
our method and then the Kalman filter is

424
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,075
如果，指导非常重要
a very very big deal in guidance if

425
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,365
如果你发送一枚导弹，你就是这样的
you're if you're sending up a missile a

426
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:06,675
卫星你跟踪它你做的只是
satellite you track it you do just just

427
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,185
我一直在这里讨论但是
what I've been discussing here but the

428
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,195
卡尔曼滤波器是它的更多
Kalman filter is it's it's got more

429
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,545
建立在这个可能性的可能性
possibilities built in than this one

430
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,775
这是最简单的更新
this is the simplest update possible and

431
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,205
它会打电话或进入这个类别
it would call or go in this category

432
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,965
库尔曼超越了标准更新
kulmann went beyond a standard update

433
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:36,554
如果我是的话，他是如何超越的呢？
how did he go beyond let's if I if I've

434
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,804
我应该使用卡尔曼滤波器这个词
used the words Kalman filter I should

435
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:41,565
告诉你卡尔曼是什么
tell you what what it is that Kalman

436
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,804
是什么，广场是什么
does and what is that the squares

437
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:47,745
问题就像一般的一部分
problem it's just like part of general

438
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,665
在我看来这些知识很好
knowledge that seems to me okay so what

439
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,975
是不是算多根哪些
is it counted more gen what are the

440
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,645
你看过主要的其他作品
additional pieces you've seen the main

441
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,685
这里有一个简单的递归的想法
idea here of getting a simple recursive

442
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,325
不需要重新计算的步骤
step that doesn't require recomputing

443
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,605
你之前和当然所做的一切
all that you did before and of course to

444
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,835
这反过来我会在那里申请
this inverse I'm going to apply there

445
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,235
谢尔曼莫里森将是这样的公式
shermann morrison would be formula so

446
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,095
我将使用之前的反转
I'll use the inverse that I had before

447
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,625
这将是一个排名第一
and this will be a rank one this is a

448
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,195
排名是我的一个扰动
rank one perturbation of that I'm

449
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,164
看着这里的转置
looking here at a transpose a over there

450
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,205
我看起来就像刚刚打电话一样
I was looking at just like just called

451
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,205
它或我甚至称它为身份
it a or I even called it the identity

452
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,635
矩阵但它是你拥有的任何矩阵
matrix but it's whatever matrix you have

453
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,395
这里有一级扰动和
here with a rank one perturbation and

454
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,205
整个事情必须倒置好
the whole thing has to be inverted okay

455
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,924
所以我要说的是什么
and so I was going to say what is

456
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,025
另外，你知道卡尔曼
additional just so you know about Kalman

457
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,445
过滤器，所以两件事是额外的
filters so two things are additional the

458
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,595
重点是卡尔曼滤波器
point the point is Kalman filters are

459
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,804
对于动态最小二乘，我会说
for dynamic least squares I would say

460
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,685
动态最小二乘等有
dynamic least squares and so there are

461
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,544
你没见过两种成分
two ingredients that you haven't seen

462
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:13,365
这里有一个成分是使用的想法
here one ingredient is the idea of using

463
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,575
协方差矩阵告诉你
the covariance matrix which tells you

464
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,145
错误如何相关
how errors are correlated

465
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,515
所以这将是加权最小二乘法
so that would be weighted least squares

466
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,345
或相关最小二乘这些
or correlated least squares these

467
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:34,965
正方形是这些方块让我公正
squares is so these squares let me just

468
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,165
提醒
remind

469
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:41,555
我可以在这里写这些广场
I can write it here so these square

470
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:51,525
标准标准意味着数据是
standard standard meaning that data is

471
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,985
不相关它都有相同的
not correlated it all has the same

472
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,415
方差这些是统计词
variance these are the statistics words

473
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,595
当我上次在这里时，我正在使用它
that I'm using when I last time in this

474
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,285
但是我会正确地谈论这个问题
but that I'll talk about properly so the

475
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,555
标准的是协变的
standard one is the covariant the

476
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:19,395
标准意味着协方差等于
standard means covariance equal the

477
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,885
您正在做的身份矩阵
identity matrix you're doing like

478
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,865
高斯正态概率但有
Gaussian normal probability but with

479
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,855
只是标准的高斯标准
just standard gaussians standard

480
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,675
高斯因此是其中的一个方面
Gaussian so that's one aspect which in

481
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,195
德雷珀实验室的工作让我们说
the work of the Draper lab let's say

482
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,625
他们必须认为他们得到了
they have to think okay they're getting

483
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,625
传感器不同类型的传感器与
sensors different kinds of sensors with

484
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,665
不同的准确度不同
different accuracies different

485
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,125
他们必须具备可靠性
reliability so they have they have to

486
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,955
考虑协方差矩阵
take account of the covariance matrix

487
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,565
那么另一点也是如此
then the other point is and also so that

488
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:09,305
是0.10.2是你的动态部分
was 0.1 0.2 is the dynamic part you're

489
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:15,095
那是一个状态方程式
the co there's a state equation that's

490
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,195
所以我真的处于控制的边缘
so I'm really into the edge of control

491
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,745
理论所以让我用一些话来说
theory so let me just use some words

492
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,035
在这里，你已经看到你是否如此控制
here that you've seen if you so control

493
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,725
理论有一个状态方程是什么
theory has a state equation what's

494
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,875
在美学上这是什么状态
aesthetically what is the state this is

495
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,195
在我的例子中，位置是
the position in my example is the

496
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,955
卫星的位置
position of the satellite

497
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,435
所以我们正在寻找一个令人高兴的解决方案
so are we looking for a fix a delight

498
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,435
当然不是卫星正在移动
certainly not the satellite is moving so

499
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,274
状态方程告诉我多少
the state equation tells me how much the

500
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,554
卫星它的牛顿定律告诉我
satellite it's Newton's law tells me

501
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,504
卫星应该在哪里
where the satellite should be where am I

502
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:04,984
看着
looking

503
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:09,995
然后最小二乘告诉我他
and then the least-squares tells me he

504
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,824
说看看那种中位数
says look around that sort of median

505
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:18,574
对于实际位置立场
position for the actual position that

506
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:23,824
这些数据只是给予了
that the data is giving so just just to

507
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:27,715
说让我让我总结这个
say let me let me summarize this the

508
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,525
卡尔曼滤波器是一个显着的
Kalman filter is a significantly

509
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,465
递归方格的改进版本
improved version of recursively squares

510
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,844
那是递归的新方格
that's recursively squares new

511
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:44,094
测量是变化的事情但是
measurement comes in changes things but

512
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:49,745
留下很大一部分，你做的
leaves a big part unchanged and you make

513
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,985
你发现新发现的新东西
the you find the new you find that new

514
00:34:52,990 --> 00:35:00,455
用卡尔曼滤波器退出你有一个
exit with a Kalman filter you there's a

515
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,945
这里中间的协方差矩阵
covariance matrix in the middle here

516
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,614
这就是协方差矩阵的地方
that's where covariance matrices go

517
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:09,485
这是矩阵协方差或逆矩阵
that's matrix covariance or inverse

518
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,235
协方差时间以及为什么不这样做
covariance times that and well why don't

519
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,925
我们看到右边的协方差
we see see the covariances at the right

520
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,755
时间好吧所以也许我的那些会议纪要
time okay so maybe my those minutes that

521
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,245
我已经占据了真正要得到的
I've occupied were just to really to get

522
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,225
你最简单的听到这个名字
you to hear that name for the simplest

523
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,614
更新和凯尔曼的名字更多
update and kellman's name for a more

524
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:39,025
一般更新没事
general update okay done

525
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,875
好吧哦，这也是要做的
okay oh that was this is also to be done

526
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,035
你在哪里知道顶部
where's ya know up top

527
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,905
我似乎在这里的应用程序
I seem to be into the applications here

528
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:57,445
我答应如何发现这个公式
I promised how to discover the formula

529
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:03,635
也许我永远都不会知道，因为我
maybe I'll never know okay because I'm

530
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,305
真的更感兴趣的是它的好处
really more interested in what's it good

531
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,185
对于
for

532
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,975
好的，那么使用第一名是好的
okay so what's it good use number one

533
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,425
现在我正在备份轻松简单
now I'm backing up to the easy easy

534
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,955
问题假设II已经或者然后让
question suppose I I had or and then let

535
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,025
我甚至做了一些矩阵来改变
me even make some matrix to change the

536
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,705
矩阵到这里使它更现实
matrix to a here makes it more realistic

537
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,185
还好还好我要去的副本，在这里充分
okay okay I'm gonna copy that here fully

538
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,595
在发现公式的那一刻
on discovering the formula the moment

539
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:43,325
我们只是用它好了，所以我想，
let's just use it okay so I suppose that

540
00:36:43,330 --> 00:37:03,025
一个U就是它的盐现在好了，现在盐了
a U is be its salt okay now now salt a

541
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:11,854
加-好吧让我排名第一
plus - all right let me do the rank one

542
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:21,425
a-UV转置B这是什么X.
a - UV transpose B what's X this is the

543
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,765
我真的很想问题
problem that I really would like to

544
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,995
解决，让我确定我这样做
solve let me just be sure I'm doing this

545
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,815
对
right

546
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:46,215
是的是的还好没事想你我
yep okay yep all right suppose I you

547
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,225
知道它有点类似于什么
know it's a little it's similar to what

548
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,775
我们在凯勒曼的情况下
we had in the Kellerman situation

549
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,795
假设我现在解决了一个问题
suppose I've solved one problem but now

550
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,625
我把第一级扰乱了矩阵，所以我
I perturb the matrix by rank one so I

551
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,025
有一个新的问题，新的答案，
have a new problem with a new answer and

552
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,995
我想快点得到答案，是的
I want to get that answer quickly yeah

553
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,315
哦，不，谢谢
oh no thank you

554
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,635
非常感谢，让我们称呼这个人
thank you very much let's call this guy

555
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:23,925
Z好的没关系，这太好了
Z okay okay so that's great

556
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,195
所以这就是我解决的问题
so so that's that's what I've solved for

557
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,085
换句话说，我发现了一个逆
W in other words I have found a inverse

558
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,945
B和我想找到这个问题的答案
B and I want to find the answer to that

559
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,385
新问题
new question

560
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,835
所以我扰乱矩阵就是这样
so I perturb the matrix it's it's the

561
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,965
线性系统中的系数矩阵
coefficient matrix in a linear system

562
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,825
而我只是想解决那个线性问题
and I just want to solve that linear

563
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,665
系统还好，如果我不知道的话
system okay now so if I didn't know

564
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,365
关于这些公式我会做什么的
anything about these formulas I would

565
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,635
这里有一个新矩阵我必须这样做
have a new matrix here I'd have to it

566
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,155
需要n个立方体步骤才能完成
would take n cube steps to do

567
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:07,085
消除并得到新的答案
elimination and and get the new answer

568
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,795
但重点是使用旧的答案
but the point is to use the old answer

569
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,985
重点是使用旧的答案和
the point is to use the old answer and

570
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,775
现在让我说一下这是什么和
now let me just say what this is and

571
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:25,715
这是本节中的问题三，但是
it's problem three in this section but

572
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,475
好的
so okay

573
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,545
换句话说，我们知道我们已经知道了
so in other words we know about a we've

574
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:41,715
解决了那个我要做的事情
solved that one so what I'm gonna do

575
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,055
而不是解决一个全新的问题
instead of solving a whole new problem

576
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:52,875
我会这么快就有了这个主意
I'm gonna so quickly it's the idea and

577
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,205
这就是我要解决的想法
here's the idea I'm gonna I've solved

578
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,094
那一个，我要解决一秒钟
that one and I'm gonna solve a second

579
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:03,705
问题也解决了同样的问题
problem also solve a with the same

580
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,625
矩阵a呐喊一次我应该怎样
matrix a whoops a times what shall I

581
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,705
打电话给未知
call the unknown

582
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:19,005
还有的电子ü所以这是我的问题，我知道
there's e u so this is my problem I know

583
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,785
U和V转置，但我没有
the U and the V transpose but I don't

584
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,614
真想找到这个的倒数
really want to find the inverse of this

585
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,245
从头开始的矩阵所以这个想法就是这样
matrix from scratch so the idea is that

586
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,665
如果我合适地结合起来
if I combine suitably combine the

587
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,375
原始问题的解决方案
solutions to the original problem the

588
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,324
原始解决方案W和解决方案
original solution W and the solution to

589
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:41,985
这个问题跟你那里的新人有关
this problem with the new guy you there

590
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,854
不论如何，到结合W和
that somehow by combining the W and the

591
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,425
Z我会得到这个答案X的
Z I'm gonna get this answer X that's

592
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:55,064
通过弄清楚W，我就是那样的
where I'm that's um by by figuring out W

593
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:57,614
和Z所以你看到我做了什么我已经
and Z so do you see what I've done I've

594
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:00,824
解决了我已解决的矩阵问题
solved the with the matrix a I've solved

595
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:05,715
两个问题确实需要两倍
two problems does that take twice as

596
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,834
如果我有相同的矩阵a
long if I if I have the same matrix a

597
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:15,195
但不同的右手边b如果我
but different right hand sides b if i

598
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,255
把它变成了鲁的所有艰苦工作
factor it a into Lu all the hard work is

599
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,035
虽然全部在左侧完成
done there on the left side although all

600
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,435
这项工作是在找到卢然后完成的
the work is done in finding Lu and then

601
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,614
我只是替代找到了
I just back substitute to find the

602
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,675
第二种解决方案这是如此根本
second solution this is so fundamental

603
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,185
我强调的是，如果你有
that I'm emphasizing it that if you have

604
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,245
你没有多个右手边
multiple right-hand sides you don't

605
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,854
每次都回去工作
every time go back and and work on the

606
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,985
左侧与左侧相同
left side the left side with the same

607
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,125
矩阵
matrix a

608
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,915
只是会做同样的事情
just would do the same stuff the same

609
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,944
罗斯维尔和枢轴以及所有这些东西
Roseville and pivots and all that stuff

610
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:51,944
会发生，因为它和你一样
will happen because it's the same a you

611
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:55,004
只是附上你真的只是坚持一个
just attach you really just stick a

612
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:59,084
第二列确实是快速的方法
second column really the the fast way to

613
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:05,685
做到这两个解决方案来了
do it is a w-z the two solutions come

614
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,114
从B和你我刚才把它
from the B and the you I've just put the

615
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,175
两个问题，共同强调，
two problems together to emphasize that

616
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,435
矩阵A是它的这个相同
the matrix a is the same it's the this

617
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,774
是大多数工作的地方，但它
is where most of the work goes but it

618
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:23,204
只有这一点才会到那里
only goes there once that's the point

619
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,165
好的
okay

620
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,484
最后我应该记笔记
then finally I'm supposed to the notes

621
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:31,925
应该告诉我如何结合
are supposed to tell me how to combine

622
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,415
两个答案W和Z得到了
the two answers W and Z to get the

623
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,385
回答X所以让我写下来
answer X so let me write that down

624
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:44,264
这将是使用号码
and that will be that will be use number

625
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:48,854
谢尔曼·莫里森之一
one of the of the shermann morrison

626
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:52,034
伍德伯里公式好，所以我正在计划
Woodberry formula okay so i'm planning

627
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,284
根据这个把它写下来
to just write it down according to this

628
00:42:54,289 --> 00:43:00,794
第二步是我们想要的答案
step two is the answer we want here

629
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:03,524
写X所以我没有用过相同的
written X so I haven't used the same

630
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:07,094
笔记中的字母是原件
letters as in the notes is the original

631
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:13,454
好，然后改变，因为我
W good and then a change because I've

632
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:17,114
改变了问题所以我要去
changed the problem so I'm going to

633
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,844
改变答案，但事情是
change the answer but the thing is to

634
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:23,734
得到这个答案就是我必须的
get this answer it's just I have to

635
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:27,885
在任何地方除以那个决定因素
divide by that determinant wherever it

636
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:36,464
虽然哦，是的，我很抱歉，我正在使用
was though oh yeah I'm sorry I'm using

637
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:39,494
这里的一个，我还没有给你的
the a here and I haven't given you the

638
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:46,814
公式为使将不得不等待，所以
formula for a so that'll have to wait so

639
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:51,705
它就是这样，我会在这里确定
it's just so I'll put determinate here

640
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,095
和shermann莫里森会想通
and shermann morrison would be figured

641
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:03,645
那个，然后哦，对不起，我们知道
that out and then oh I'm sorry we know

642
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,715
那是什么我们想要一个减去V
what that is we want one minus V

643
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,705
转置Z所以它是这里的V之一
transpose Z so it's the V from here one

644
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,365
减去V转置，它就是那里的Z.
minus V transpose and it's the Z there

645
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:21,435
噢，好的，所以我会得到一个
oh yeah okay good so so I'm gonna get a

646
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,665
改变解W的公式
formula that that changes the solution W

647
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,175
通过我们认识到的一个术语来临
by a term that we recognize is coming

648
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,815
来自谢尔曼莫里森伍德伯里和那
from shermann morrison Woodbury and that

649
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:39,185
分子中的项是Z的倍数
term in the numerator is a multiple of Z

650
00:44:39,190 --> 00:45:06,465
X所以我使用W是W倍X所以V
X so I'm using W yes W times X so the V

651
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,705
在这里我只是使用V是一样的
here I'm just using the V is the same

652
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:18,165
事情那么好我认为那是我认为的上帝
thing so okay I think that's God I think

653
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:24,015
这很好，所以重点是2倍
that's good so again the point was 2x

654
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,995
不会出现在这里，因为它是什么
doesn't appear here because it's what

655
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,685
我之后是使用W和Z的
I'm after is to use the W and the Z the

656
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,195
W和Z和我当然必须使用
W and the Z and I have to use of course

657
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,975
V和我必须使用U和那个
the V and I have to use the U and that

658
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,355
在这里使用所以必须的一切
got used here so everything that had to

659
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,535
使用得到了，这就是答案
be used got used and that was the answer

660
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,895
所以这是基本用途，如果我是，如果我
so that's the basic use is if I'm if I

661
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,425
扰动问题的左手
perturbed the problem the the left hand

662
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,985
那边解决方案的变化是什么
side what's the change in the solution

663
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,455
在这里与这些广场
over here with these squares

664
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,545
这是我扰乱左手的一样
it was the same I perturb the left hand

665
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,044
侧
side

666
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:07,174
但因为那里有正方形
but because it was these squares there

667
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:10,264
是一个转置辅助处理如此
was an a transpose aid to deal with so

668
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:13,084
这就像一个级别更难
this was like one level more difficult

669
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:15,274
因为它涉及转置王牌和
because it involved a transpose ace and

670
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:19,794
这里只是直白啊好了，
here was just straightforward eh okay so

671
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:33,454
是的，谢谢我可能会这样做
yes thanks I could probably do this

672
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:36,454
其他方式是啊是啊是的我希望你
other ways yeah yeah yeah I hope you

673
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:39,724
希望你能跟进这一点，把它写
hope you follow up on that and write it

674
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:44,885
是的，是的，所以也许我做了什么
down yeah yeah so maybe what I've done

675
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,434
是我今天的目标首先是
is what my goal was for today first to

676
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:52,794
显示逆的公式
show you the formula for the inverse

677
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:55,084
第二，认识到它有
second to recognize that it has

678
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:59,584
排名K的有趣重要性
interesting importance that a rank K

679
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:02,404
矩阵的变化带来了等级a
change in the matrix brings a rank a

680
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:05,824
我们可以改变倒数
change in the inverse and that we can

681
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:08,284
该公式表示将N反转为n
the formula says to invert an N by n

682
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:10,984
你可以通过矩阵切换和反转K.
matrix you can switch and invert a K by

683
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:13,924
K矩阵，然后我谈到了一对
K matrix and then I spoke about a couple

684
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:16,294
应用程序所以我唯一的事情
of the applications so the only thing I

685
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:19,174
没做的就是给你全力
have not done is to give you the full

686
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:22,294
讲道莫里森伍德伯里公式
sermon Morrison Woodberry formula the

687
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:24,424
一个人就是一个人
one with an a the one that's up on the

688
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:27,875
我可以最终做到这一点
right can I do that finally you could

689
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,035
可能猜猜它会是什么
probably guess what it's going to be

690
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,135
哪里还有一个还好
where's there's gotta be one more okay

691
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:42,535
所以我只听到谢尔曼马辛伍德伯里
so I I just hear Sherman Marcin Woodbury

692
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,595
什么是完整的东西呢
and what's the complete thing it's a

693
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,795
减去UV转置，所以这是n
minus UV transpose inverse so this is n

694
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,055
由N和它现在是一个A而不是一个
by N and it's an A now instead of an

695
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,995
身份矩阵就是区别
identity matrix that's the difference

696
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,795
这是由KKbyn所以它的等级
and this is n by K K by n so it's rank

697
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,535
洞穴扰动和开始我出去
Cave perturbation and start me out on

698
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,365
在公式上什么是第一个
the on the formula what's the first

699
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:16,615
我必须写一个反转所以我
thing I have to write a inverse so I

700
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,555
从反向开始，我减去
start with a inverse and I subtract

701
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,615
什么东西，它会是一个副本
something and it's gonna be a copy of

702
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,955
这个除了好吧也许它只是可能
this except well maybe it's just maybe

703
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,445
它只是一个完美的副本也许我只是
it's just a perfect copy maybe I just

704
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:34,405
我需要你从左边开始
need to you I'm going from that left

705
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:39,115
现在我登上了洞穴，我放在那里
board now I cave where do I put in there

706
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:45,625
我要去要确定一下所以我们
I am gonna have to look ok so we're

707
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,795
现在写下完整的公式
writing down now the formula the full

708
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,865
比例没关系
scale okay

709
00:48:51,870 --> 00:49:00,685
哦，没事在这里是有一个一个
oh all right here it is there's an a

710
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,635
反过来你现在来了整个
inverse you now comes the in that whole

711
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,115
倒过来，你会期待我
thing inverted that you'll expect I

712
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,775
减去V转置你所有的逆
minus V transpose a inverse you all

713
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,615
逆，然后还有另外两个
inverse and then there's another two

714
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:22,585
件V转置反转所以我没有
pieces V transpose a inverse so I didn't

715
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,745
展望未来，将它全部放在一条线上，但是
look ahead to get it all on one line but

716
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,225
你明白这是什么哦那是
do you see what this is there oh that's

717
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,745
可能就是那个是的
probably is that yeah that's the

718
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,025
身份正确，因为我们已经拥有
identity right right because we've got

719
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,085
足够的倒数我相信是的
enough a inverses I believe that's the

720
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:41,875
生命的最后终极公式在这里，
final ultimate formula of life here that

721
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,415
我们用等级K改变了它
we've changed it by rank K

722
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,515
这是原始的逆和
here's the original inverse and

723
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,785
大概这是K级改变是的
presumably this is a rank K change yeah

724
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,205
那将是一个变化和排名
that's a that'll be a rank a change and

725
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,355
它只需要我们来计算它
and it only requires us to compute that

726
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,045
反转那里的电缆是K的
inverse where that's cable that's a K by

727
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:08,425
K矩阵对，谢谢你允许
K matrix right thank you for allowing

728
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:14,125
这小时50分钟的公式如此
this hour 50 minutes of formulas so

729
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,335
这真的是什么来如此
that's really what what that comes to so

730
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,125
所以这是第四节中的第一节
so that's section four point one of the

731
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:24,685
注意到一些应用程序，我们会
notes with some applications and we will

732
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:28,370
move on to other circumstances of low

733
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:32,330
转移到低其他情况

734
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,330
排名好谢谢
rank good thank you
