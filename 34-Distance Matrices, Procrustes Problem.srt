好的开始我以为我会
ok getting getting started I thought I'd

10
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:33,435
添加一些关于这个问题的话
add a few words about a question that

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,835
在课后假设出现了
came up after class suppose in that

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,295
上次讨论你在哪里
discussion last time where you were

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,645
给了三个你给了一个距离
given three you were given a distance

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,465
矩阵你得到了距离
matrix you were given the distance

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,055
介于x2和x2之间x2和x3之间
between x1 and x2 between x2 and x3 and

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,234
在x1和x3之间你想找到
between x1 and x3 and you wanted to find

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,144
我们满意的要点
points that satisfied that well we're

18
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,845
要失败在这个例子中，因为如果
going to fail on this example because if

19
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,565
这里的距离为1的距离在这里
the distance here is 1 the distance here

20
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,005
是1，那么通过三角不等式的
is 1 then by the triangle inequality the

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,615
从x1到x3的距离不能太多
distance from x1 to x3 could not be more

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,404
超过2，当我们摆正它时它可以
than 2 and when we square it it could

23
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:21,794
不超过4，这里是6
not be more than 4 and here it's 6 so

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,445
什么会发生什么问题
what's going to happen what goes wrong

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,205
在那种情况下，是的，我没有评论过
in that case yeah I hadn't commented on

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,404
这一点，我不知道是该
that and I'm not sure that that the

27
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,715
我引用的论文是这样的，所以我有
paper that I referenced does so so I had

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,145
做一点回顾
to do a little search back in the

29
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,934
人们不能忽视文学
literature cuz people couldn't overlook

30
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:50,345
这个问题所以这是三角形
this problem so this is the triangle

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:57,945
不平等失败，所以它不是
inequality fails so that and it's not

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,815
将帮助进入十个维度
going to help to go into ten dimensions

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,415
因为三角不等式没有
because the triangle inequality doesn't

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,715
不会改变，它仍然存在
doesn't change and it's still there in

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,354
十个维度，我们仍然失败
ten dimensions and we're still failing

36
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:13,844
它会发生什么事情呢？
it so what happens well what could

37
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,075
发生
happen

38
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,935
你记得吗，你必须这样做
do you remember and you'll have to

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,415
提醒我你的关键等式
remind me the the key equation you

40
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,115
记得我们有一个方程式连接
remember we had an equation connecting

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,025
连接那么矩阵D是什么
connecting so what is the matrix D for

42
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,155
这个问题，让d是，这是一个三通过
this problem so D is this is a three by

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,815
具有这些距离的三个矩阵
three matrix with these distances

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,365
平方，这是方便使用
squared and it was convenient to use

45
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,375
距离平方因为那是什么
distances squared because that's what

46
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,815
当然，我会进入下一步
comes into the next steps so of course

47
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,585
从每个X到它自身的距离是0
the distance from each X to itself is 0

48
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,735
距x平方的距离是
the distance from x distance squared was

49
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,885
这是一个，但这个是6
that this one was that but this one is 6

50
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,805
好的，这就是距离矩阵和我们
ok so that's the distance matrix and we

51
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,375
我想找工作找
would like to find the job was to find

52
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,865
一周，我只想写下我们
week and I'm just going to write down we

53
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:25,005
找不到x1x2和x3也不匹配
cannot find x1 x2 and x3 too to match

54
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,765
那些距离所以出了什么问题
those distances so what goes wrong well

55
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,325
只有一件事可以发生
there's only one thing that could go

56
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,205
连接此距离时错误
wrong when you connect this distance

57
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:37,005
矩阵D到矩阵X转置X你
matrix D to the matrix X transpose X you

58
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,075
记住位置矩阵也许我
remember the position matrix maybe I

59
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,365
称之为G，这就是GIJ
called it G this this is giving so G IJ

60
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:54,285
是XI与XJoops的点积
is the dot product of X I with XJ oops

61
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:04,665
作出这样的成为J在这里谢谢你这么g^
make that into a J here thank you so g

62
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,485
IJ是点积和矩阵
IJ is the matrix of dot products and the

63
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,875
伟大的事情是我们可以发现
great thing was that we can discover

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,335
矩阵G来自哪个矩阵
what that matrix that matrix G comes

65
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,515
直接来自D直接来自D.
directly from D comes directly from D

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,885
当然我们怎么知道这个
and of course what do we know about this

67
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,615
我们知道它的交叉产品矩阵
matrix of cross products we know that it

68
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:32,645
是半正定的
is positive semi-definite

69
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,784
所以在一句话中出了问题
so what goes wrong well just in a word

70
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,724
当我们写的是方程
when we write out that equation and

71
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,515
发现三角形是什么G
discover what G is if the triangle

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,925
不平等失败我们知道G是G
inequality fails we learn that G is G

73
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,765
并不是肯定的
doesn't come out positive definite

74
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,944
这就是我想说的全部和我
that's really all I want to say and I

75
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,185
可以推动G的例子
could push through the example G will

76
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,914
如果D如果，那就不是肯定的
not come out positive definite if D if

77
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,685
这是D，因为如果它出来它就不能
that's D because it can't if it came out

78
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,715
肯定的，然后我们可以找到一个
positive definite then we could find an

79
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,134
X所以，如果我们有G，那么最后一步
X so if we had the G then the final step

80
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,134
你还记得我们找到一个X井
you remember is to find an X well we

81
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,485
知道如果G是半正定的
know that if G is positive semi-definite

82
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,375
有多种方法可以找到x你
there are multiple ways to find an x you

83
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,405
知道这是正半确定的
know this is positive semi definite

84
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,565
矩阵就是你从X中获得的
matrices is what you get out of X

85
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,255
转置Xs我们可以找到一个给定的x
transpose X s and we can find an x given

86
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,335
我们可以找到G得到一个X所以它有
a G we can find G given an X so it has

87
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:48,735
是，这不会是真实的，
to be that this won't be true that the

88
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,865
矩阵G来自该等式
matrix G that comes out of that equation

89
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,444
会变成不为正
will turn out not to be positive

90
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,315
确定所以这真的很不错
definite so it's it's really quite nice

91
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,515
这是一个美丽的一点点
it's a beautiful little bit of

92
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,925
数学，如果当且仅当
mathematics that if if and only if the

93
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,895
三角不等式得到满足
triangle inequality is satisfied by

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,065
这些数字当且仅当时
these numbers if and only if then the

95
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,325
然后在D矩阵中的矩阵
matrix that in the in the D matrix then

96
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,545
即这样来的G矩阵
the G matrix that comes out of this

97
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,455
我没写过的等式是
equation which I haven't written is

98
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,914
如果三角形是正半正定的
positive semi-definite if the triangle

99
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,284
不平等是可以的，我们可以找到
inequality is okay we can find the

100
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,615
如果三角形不等式是分数
points if the triangle inequality is

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,295
像这里我们那样违反了矩阵G.
violated like here we then the matrix G

102
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,395
不是半正定的
is not positive semi-definite has

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,154
负特征值，我们找不到
negative eigenvalues and we cannot find

104
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,605
关键是我能记得G
the point yeah I could recall the G

105
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,384
矩阵
matrix

106
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:48,434
G等式，但它来了
the the G equation but it's coming to

107
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:54,934
你在两页的部分
you in the two page section that does

108
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:00,495
只是距离矩阵好吧那就是
just distance matrices okay that that's

109
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,825
我有点喜欢这样做
just I sort of like made a point it's

110
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,284
很高兴有特定的数字和我
nice to have specific numbers and I

111
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,624
可以得到G和的具体数字
could get the specific numbers for G and

112
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,904
我们不会认为这不是积极的
we would see no way it's not positive

113
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:17,295
确定好，所以这只是整理
definite okay so that's just tidying up

114
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,634
上次我有另一个小问题
last time I have another small problem

115
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,355
谈论，然后一个大问题
to talk about and then a big question of

116
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,164
深度学习是否真的有效我
whether deep learning actually works I

117
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,404
昨晚有专家发来的电子邮件
had an email from an expert last night

118
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,175
这改变了我对世界的看法
which changed my view of the world about

119
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,874
这个问题，你可以想像的了
that question as you can imagine the the

120
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,925
改变我的世界是我曾经想过的
change in my world was I had thought the

121
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,295
答案是肯定的，我现在认为
answer was yes and I now think the

122
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,105
答案不是没有，所以这就像是一个
answer isn't no so that's like rather a

123
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,985
十八六五的大问题但是
big issue for eighteen oh six five but

124
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,075
我们将让我们看到以后好吗
we'll let's see about that later okay

125
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,495
还好我现在就ProQuest的这些问题，所以
okay now I'll proquest these problem so

126
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,765
prouKrusty和我把它包括在内
prou Krusty's and i it's included in the

127
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,374
注意到这个名字来自希腊语
notes it's that name comes from a Greek

128
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:17,524
神话是你们到希腊神话等等
myth are you guys into Greek myths so

129
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,384
每个Krusty的故事是什么？
what was the story of per Krusty's he

130
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:28,964
在Procrustes调整了
was at Procrustes who adjusted the

131
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:33,334
他的长度让他有一张特别的床
lengths of his so he had a special bed

132
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,495
对于crusties床一定长度和
for crusties bed certain lengths and

133
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,615
然后他有来访的游客
then he had visitors coming and instead

134
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,885
的调节所述床的所述长度
of adjusting the length of the bed to

135
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,815
适合Krusty调整后的访客
fit the visitor for Krusty's adjusted

136
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,574
适合床的访客的长度
the length of the visitor to fit the bed

137
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:54,285
所以要么拉伸访客，要么切碎
so either stretch the visitor or chopped

138
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,275
离
off

139
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,425
访客的一部分，所以无论如何它是它的
part of the visitor so anyway it's it's

140
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,175
希腊人这样或东西好了，
the Greeks like this or a thing okay so

141
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,295
无论如何，那是希腊神话
anyway that's that's a Greek myth for

142
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,825
十八，六，六，好，所以整个
eighteen oh six five okay so the whole

143
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,615
想法有打击茶的问题是
idea there percuss teas problem is to

144
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,645
做一些适合别的东西所以
make something fit something else so the

145
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:26,145
所以这两件事情都是如此假设我
so the two things are so suppose I'm

146
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,115
我只有三个维度
just in three dimensions I have two

147
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,205
这里向量排序的基础
vectors here sort of a basis for a

148
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,395
二维空间和我在这里
two-dimensional space and over here I

149
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:42,695
有太空科学家可能有的人
have people space scientists might have

150
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,295
一个位置的计算
one computation of the of the positions

151
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,085
当然他们是卫星
of satellites then of course they

152
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,765
不会多达这是关
wouldn't be off by as much as this

153
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,745
图显示但是他们有另一个
figure shows but then they have another

154
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,615
使用不同坐标计算
computation using different coordinates

155
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,535
所以它是部分旋转的
so it so it's it's partly rotated from

156
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,834
这张照片，但它也部分得到了
this picture but also it's partly got

157
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,455
舍入错误和错误
roundoff errors and an error in it

158
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,885
两者之间所以问题是
between the two so the question is

159
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,915
什么是最好的正交
what's the best best orthogonal

160
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,195
改造所以这是一个
transformation so this is this is a

161
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,165
一堆矢量X1X22Xn让我们说
bunch of vectors X 1 X 2 2 X n let's say

162
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,885
我想把它们乘以一个
and I want to multiply them by an

163
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,345
正交矩阵没有，我可能会这样做
orthogonal matrix no maybe I'd do it on

164
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:35,865
另一边，我觉得我做的啊Q的
the other side I think I do yeah q to be

165
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,795
尽可能接近另一套Y.
as close as possible to this other set Y

166
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,185
1y2到Yn所以让我说吧
1 y 2 up to Y n so let me just say it

167
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,635
再次
again

168
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,265
我有两组矢量而且我是
I have two sets of vectors and I'm

169
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,935
看起来和他们不一样
looking and they're different like those

170
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,465
两套，我正在寻找
two sets and I'm looking for the

171
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,115
正交矩阵以及
orthogonal matrix that as well as

172
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,505
可能将此集合纳入此中
possible takes this set into this one of

173
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,875
当然，如果这是如果这是一个
course if this was if this was an

174
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,765
正交基础，这是一个
orthogonal basis and this was an

175
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,505
正交基
orthogonal basis

176
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,644
那么我们就可以回家免费问：我们能
then we would be home free q we could

177
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,285
得到平等，我们可以采取正交
get equality we could take an orthogonal

178
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,194
直接基于正交基础
basis directly into an orthogonal basis

179
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:21,795
在其他情况下使用正交矩阵Q.
with a orthogonal matrix Q in other

180
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,045
如果X是正交矩阵，则为单词
words if X was an orthogonal matrix and

181
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,954
Y是我们得到的正交矩阵
Y was an orthogonal matrix we would get

182
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,805
这是完全正确的q，但事实并非如此
it the exact correct q but that's not

183
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,965
这样的话我们正在寻找最好的
the case so we're looking for the best

184
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,485
可能这样就是问题所在
possible so that's the the problem then

185
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:45,644
如果我最小化过正交，则最小化
minimize if I minimize over orthogonal

186
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,485
矩阵矩阵Q和我只想得到
matrix matrices Q and I just want to get

187
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,925
我的符号在这里保持一致没关系
my notation to be consistent here okay

188
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:03,584
好的，所以我看到我开始了
okay so I've I see that I starting with

189
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:08,565
Y和将它们映射到X的所以让我们
the Y's and mapping them to X's so let

190
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,894
我问什么都般的暴徒“厄尔尼诺问题
me ask the question what are thuggin 'el

191
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,884
矩阵q乘以Y来表示
matrix q multiplies the Y's to come as

192
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:19,235
尽可能接近x，所以我
close as possible to the x's so so I

193
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,814
在我想要的所有正交Q上
over all orthogonal Q's I want to

194
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:29,415
在Frobenius中最小化YQ减去X.
minimize Y Q minus X in the Frobenius

195
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:35,685
因此Frobenius我们进入了平常
norm squared so Frobenius we're into the

196
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:45,095
Frobenius规范记得矩阵
Frobenius norm remember the of a matrix

197
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,465
这是一个非常方便的诺曼德
this is a very convenient Normand in

198
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,095
数据科学来衡量一个人的规模
data science to measure the size of a

199
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,524
矩阵，我们有几种可能
matrix and we have several possible

200
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,735
它的公式所以让我打电话
formulas for it so the so let me call

201
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,334
矩阵a和Frobenius范数
the matrix a and the Frobenius norm

202
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:02,235
平方
squared

203
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,355
好吧那么这就是一个表达方式
okay so what's one expression in terms

204
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,225
矩阵条目的数字
of the entries of the matrix the numbers

205
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,005
一个IJ和基质中的Frobenius范数
a IJ and the matrix the Frobenius norm

206
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,454
只是把它像一个长的矢量如此
is just treats it like a long vector so

207
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,084
它是1平方加1平方
it's a 1 1 squared plus a 1 2 squared

208
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,465
一路
all the way

209
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:33,165
我会说第一到第二行
the first plus second row just I'll say

210
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,945
NN所有的方块的平方之和确定
n n square ok sum of all the squares

211
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,945
只是将它视为长矢量好吧
just treating it like a long vector okay

212
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,785
这个，但这是一个尴尬的表达
this but that's a awkward expression to

213
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,535
写下来
write down

214
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,645
那么我们还有什么方法可以找到
so what other ways do we have to find

215
00:13:51,650 --> 00:14:00,045
我们可以看到矩阵的Frobenius范数
the Frobenius norm of a matrix let's see

216
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:07,845
我可以把它看成是一个转置
I can look at this as a transpose a is

217
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,595
那个正确的转置一个什么是什么的
that right a transpose a so what what's

218
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,175
发生在那里
happening there

219
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:20,565
提醒我，是的，我会得到所有
remind me what yeah I I would get all

220
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,095
我会通过拿走所有这些
that I would get all these by taking the

221
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,575
矩阵a转置时间a但是什么
matrix a transpose times a but what

222
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:38,415
对不起，我不是，我不是我没有我
sorry I'm not I'm not I haven't I've

223
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,175
在这里失去了我的谈话威胁
lost my threat of of talk here

224
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,265
所以这是哦，然后我走了踪迹
so here's oh and then I take the trace

225
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,705
当然这样第一排第一列
of course so that first row first column

226
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:58,485
有一次会给我一个
of a times that one will give me the one

227
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,265
一组正方形然后那一次
set of squares and then that one times

228
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,245
另一个人会给我
the other one the next one will give me

229
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,145
下一组正方形就是这样
the next set of squares right so this is

230
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,905
去，如果我在跟踪看起来那么现在
going to if I look at the trace so now

231
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,955
让我，所以我只是想看看
let me I so I'm just want to look at the

232
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,535
对角线在这里，所以它是跟踪你
diagonal here so it's it's the trace you

233
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,105
记住一个矩阵的痕迹
remember the trace of a matrix of a

234
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,285
矩阵M是一个人M11M2
matrix M is some down the guy M 1 1 M 2

235
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,504
2到mmm
2 down to mmm

236
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:44,935
这是一个对角的太阳和一个
it's it's some it's a diagonal Sun and a

237
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,144
我这里的每个人现在都是如此
everybody with me here is now the so

238
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,355
这个术语在转置的对角线上
that term on the diagonal of a transpose

239
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,345
a然后给我所有这些或者也许
a gives me all of that then or maybe

240
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,014
我也许我应该做一个
I've maybe I should be doing a a

241
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,295
转置，重点是它没有
transpose and the point is it doesn't

242
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,754
重要的是，或者是一个转置的痕迹
matter so or the trace of a a transpose

243
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,694
那些都会给予给予
that would be those would both give give

244
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:15,845
正确的弗罗贝尼乌斯范数如此平方
the correct Frobenius norm squared so

245
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,694
痕迹将进入这个
traces are going to come into this

246
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,535
小问题
little problem

247
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,605
现在还有另一个公式
now there's another formula for the

248
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,425
弗罗贝尼乌斯的规范甚至更短
Frobenius norm even shorter well

249
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,454
肯定比这短
certainly shorter than this one

250
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,165
涉及一个正方形和什么的平方
involving a sum of squares and what's

251
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,824
那是另一种获得的方式
that one what's the other way to get

252
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:37,475
如果我看一下SVD就会得到同样的答案
this same answer if I look at the SVD

253
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,985
看奇异值我认为，
look at singular values I think that

254
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,465
这也等于西格玛
this is also equal to Sigma what are

255
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,985
所有奇异值的某个方格
some square of all the singular values

256
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,365
所以它是三个很好的表达式
so it's three nice expressions for the

257
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,425
Frobenius规范好的涉及一个
Frobenius norm the nice ones involve a

258
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,514
转置a或aa转置和
transpose a or a a transpose and of

259
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,615
连接到单数的课程
course that connects to the singular

260
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,564
价值因为什么是什么
values because what are what's the

261
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,054
奇异值与。之间的联系
connection between singular values and

262
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,294
那些和这些家伙改变一个或一个
those and these guys a transpose a or a

263
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,154
a转置奇异值是
a transpose the the singular values are

264
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,895
的或正方形的奇异值是
the or the singular value squared are

265
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,125
转置a和a的特征值
the eigenvalues of a transpose a and

266
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,605
然后，当我添加我正在添加的跟踪
then when I add up the trace I'm adding

267
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,985
提高了特征值，那就是那个
up the eigen values and that's the that

268
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,215
给了我Frobenius规范的平方
gives me the Frobenius norm squared so

269
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,105
这是一个告诉我们的东西
this is a that's a that tells us

270
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,125
重要的事情
something important

271
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,025
我们可以用不同的方式看到
which we can see in different ways that

272
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,635
所以我们要解决这个问题，我们要去
so we to solve this problem we're gonna

273
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,225
需要在各种事实，如QA
need various facts like the QA in the

274
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,205
Frobenius规范与a中的相同
Frobenius norm is the same as a in the

275
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:13,485
Frobenius没有为什么这就是为什么这样
Frobenius no why why is that why so here

276
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,465
我把每一列乘以
I'm multiplying every column by the

277
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,285
矩阵Q长度发生了什么
matrix Q what happens to the length of

278
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,405
当我乘以Q时的列
the column when I multiply it by Q

279
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,225
不会改变，所以我可以积少成多
doesn't change so I could add up the

280
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,565
列的长度都在这里平方
lengths of the columns all squared here

281
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,205
我用行来写它，但我
I wrote it in in terms of rows but I

282
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,475
本来可以重新排序并把它搞定
could have reordered that and got it in

283
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,805
列的术语是因为
terms of columns that's because the

284
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:44,175
任何矢量平方的Q倍的长度
length of Q times any any vector square

285
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,225
它与矢量平方和
it is the same as the vector square and

286
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:55,685
这些都需要这些是的列
these take these to be the columns of a

287
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,955
所以对于逐列来说
so for column by column the

288
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,295
乘用Q不改变
multiplication by Q doesn't change the

289
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,355
长度，然后当我把所有的加起来
length and then when I add up all the

290
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,005
列平方我得到的弗洛比尼范数
columns squared I get the Frobenius norm

291
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,665
平方和另一种方式说它让我们
squared and another way to say it let's

292
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,545
在这之间建立联系
make the connection between the this

293
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,515
事实上Q没有改变Frobenius
fact that Q didn't change the Frobenius

294
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,915
因此b和n这个事实
norm and this fact that therefore b

295
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,825
Gnaeus规范以表达方式表达
Gnaeus norm is expressed in terms of

296
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,275
他们的Sigma是如此，那么Q应该是什么
their Sigma's so whoa so what does Q due

297
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,605
我希望在另一个中看到西格玛
to the Sigma's I want to see in another

298
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,745
另一种方式，如果我，为什么这样的答案
another way the answer to why so if I

299
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,235
有一个具有奇异值I的矩阵a
have a matrix a with singular values I

300
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,785
乘以Q会发生什么
multiply by Q what happens to the

301
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,285
奇异值不改变不
singular values don't change don't

302
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,505
改变这是关于说的关键点
change that's the key point about saying

303
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,425
如果我乘以这样的话，那就是他们的价值观
to their values if I multiply so a has

304
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:59,055
一个SVDuSigmaV转置和Qa
an SVD u Sigma V transpose and Q a

305
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,785
我们将有SVDquSigmaV转置
we'll have the SVD qu Sigma V transpose

306
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,735
所以当我乘以Q时我都改变了
so all I've changed when I multiply by Q

307
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,785
所有我改变是第一因素
all I changed was the first factor the

308
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,505
SVDI中的第一个正交因子
first orthogonal factor in the SVD I

309
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,505
没有改变西格玛，他们仍然是
didn't change the Sigma's they're still

310
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,355
坐在那里，当然我可以
sitting there so and of course I could

311
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,845
另外Q也做Q
do also Q on the other side different Q

312
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,125
相同的Q或另一个不同的Q.
same Q or a different Q on the other

313
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,885
一方会出现在这里而不会
side would show up here and would not

314
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,045
改变Sigma的，因此会
change the Sigma's and therefore would

315
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,065
不要改变弗罗贝尼乌斯的规范
not change the Frobenius norm so that's

316
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,795
这些都是这一重要特性
these are important properties of this

317
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,395
4bGnaeus规范它看起来很混乱
4b Gnaeus norm it's a it looks messy

318
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,465
在那种形式下，但它是很多
right down in that form but it's much

319
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,065
这些形式和形式更好
nicer in these forms and in that form

320
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:55,455
好的，好吧，如果我可以那么的话
okay okay so now if I can just then then

321
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,435
我们看到它涉及痕迹所以让我
we saw that it involves traces so let me

322
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,455
对痕迹做一些观察
make a few observations about traces

323
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:13,425
好的，所以我只是想要我们想要的
okay so I'll just we want to we want to

324
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,375
能够玩跟踪和那是
be able to play with traces and that's

325
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,465
我们真的没有做过的事情
something we really haven't done here's

326
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,865
一个事实，即转置B的痕迹
a fact that the trace of a transpose B

327
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:32,165
等于B的轨迹转置a
is equal to the trace of B transpose a

328
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:38,535
当然，如果B是很明显，所有
of course if B is a it's clear and all

329
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,205
它等于Ba的痕迹
and it's equal to the trace of B a

330
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:53,145
转置所以你可以做一些改变
transpose so you can do little changes

331
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,175
在你的矩阵中没有改变
in your in your matrix without changing

332
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,565
跟踪让我们来看看，为什么这些中的一个是
the trace let's see why one of these is

333
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,755
为什么这是第一个陈述的原因
true why why is that first statement

334
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,225
真正
true

335
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,445
该矩阵与此有何关系？
how is that matrix related to this

336
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,325
矩阵它只是一个转置，如果我采取
matrix it's just a transpose if I take

337
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,395
我得到了那个矩阵的转置
the transpose of that matrix I get that

338
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,635
那么我正在添加的跟踪会发生什么
so what happens to the trace I'm adding

339
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,825
在对角线上，转置没有
down the diagonal the transpose has no

340
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,565
影响
effect

341
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,125
显然这只是事实
clearly this is just the fact that the

342
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,885
跟踪没有改变没有改变
trace doesn't change has not changed

343
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,135
当你转置矩阵因为
when you transpose a matrix because the

344
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,445
对角线现在没怎么改变了
diagonal has not changed now what about

345
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,105
这家伙我想我们要回去了
this guy I guess we're getting back to

346
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,804
老式的1806五记
old-fashioned 1806 five remembering

347
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:47,715
关于线性代数的事实，因为这个
facts about linear algebra because this

348
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,145
是纯线性代数所以这是什么
is pure linear algebra so what's this

349
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,745
一个关于
one about

350
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,135
这说我可以改变顺序
this says that I can reverse the order

351
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,915
两个矩阵的我现在在看
of two matrices I'm now looking at the

352
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,865
这两者之间的联系和和
connection between those two and and and

353
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,905
所以让我只是使用不同的
so so let me just to use different

354
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:11,835
字母CD等于DC的痕迹，我可以
letters C D equals the trace of DC I can

355
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,435
翻转那就是我所有的顺序
flip the order that's that's all I've

356
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,804
在这里完成的是我用一个转换了B.
done here is I've reversed B with a

357
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:21,225
转置我用D反转C好吧
transpose i reversed C with D okay so

358
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:28,215
为什么这才是真正的好
why is that true why is that true well

359
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,195
我们怎样才能看到这一事实的真相
how shall we see the truth of that fact

360
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,475
所以这些都是非常方便的事实
so these are really convenient facts

361
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,745
这使得很多人都使用了这种痕迹
that make a lot of people use the trace

362
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,835
比我们在1806年更常见的五个我
more often than we have in 1806 five I'm

363
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,985
不是基于的大论证用户
not a big user of arguments based on

364
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,825
追踪，但这些都是那种身份
trace but these are identities that that

365
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,424
与许多问题一起走了很长的路
go a long way with with many problems so

366
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:56,535
让我们来看看为什么这是真的任何时候你
let's see why that's true any time you

367
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,655
想想跟踪你有两个
think about trace you've got two

368
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,725
使用的语言可以使用
languages to use you can use the

369
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,495
特征值它的总和
eigenvalues it's the sum of the

370
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,975
特征值或你可以使用对角线
eigenvalues or you can use the diagonal

371
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,565
条目，因为它是的总和
entries because it's the sum of the

372
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,105
对角条目让我们使用特征值
diagonal entries let's use eigenvalues

373
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,865
如何CD的相关特征值
how are the eigenvalues of CD related to

374
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,245
DC的特征值它们是相同的
the eigenvalues of DC they're the same

375
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,345
如果这些矩阵是倾斜的
if these matrices are raked

376
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,625
然后可能会有一些额外的零
then there might be some extra zero like

377
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,424
在男人，因为他们会有
in guys because they have would have

378
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,664
不同的形状，但零不会
different shapes but zeros are not going

379
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:31,455
影响痕迹所以这就是
to affect the trace so so this is the

380
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:43,355
同样相同的非零特征值和好
same same nonzero eigenvalues okay and

381
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:52,034
所以，好吧，让我让我放手
so on yeah okay let me just let me let

382
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,605
我试着告诉你现在要采取的步骤
me try to tell you the steps now to get

383
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,355
正确的Q或让我告诉你
the correct Q in or let me tell you the

384
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:08,625
先回答，我意识到了
answer first and I'm realizing that the

385
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,654
非常重要的问题是深刻的
all-important question for does deep

386
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,414
学习实际上我们将要工作
learning actually work we're going to

387
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:16,215
今天没时间了，因为我们只有
run out of time today because we only

388
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,654
还剩几分钟
have a few minutes left

389
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:21,075
我建议我们重新提出这个问题
I suggest we bring that question back up

390
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,095
因为它对于一个非常重要
because like it's pretty important to a

391
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,835
很多人，你知道我有
lot of people there's a you know I had

392
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,815
与阿德尔曼教授共进午餐，他说
lunch with Professor Adelman and he said

393
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,935
你知道深度学习和神经网络
you know deep learning and neural nets

394
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,645
已经有了创纪录的数量
have had like a record amount of

395
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,125
公开
publicity

396
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,294
和炒作为一种计算
and hype for for a sort of computational

397
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:50,475
算法，但我有我的人
algorithm and but I had I've had people

398
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,115
现在告诉我，如果你是典型的第一
now tell me that typical first if you

399
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:03,044
使用Alex设计的网络创建
create a network using Alex's designed

400
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:07,245
例如，机会就是它
for example the chances are that it

401
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,815
成功不会成功
won't be successful that the successful

402
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,845
网络已被研究和
networks have been been worked on and

403
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,424
实验和良好的结构
experimented with and a good structure

404
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:22,815
已经出现，但没有出现在那里
has emerged but didn't wasn't there at

405
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,825
一开始所以我认为这是一个主题
the start so I think that's a topic for

406
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,685
星期一，我真的很好
for a Monday and I'm really just

407
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,995
从人说话实现
realizing from talking to people in the

408
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,785
那个领域
field that

409
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,855
这绝不是自动的
it's by no means automatic that that

410
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,235
结构即使你放入一个整体
structure even if you put in a whole

411
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,685
一堆层可能不是你的
bunch of layers it may not be what you

412
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,975
想要好，所以我让我完成这个
want okay so I'm let me finish this

413
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,225
今天的争论让我给你了
argument today let me give you the

414
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,685
回答这是什么好的提示
answer so what's the good cue

415
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:01,245
我有Y和X矩阵，这个想法是
I have matrices Y and X and the idea is

416
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,945
我把它看作Y转置X
that I take its I look at Y transpose X

417
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,835
所以这将是所有的点产品
so that'll be all the dot products of

418
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,085
一组矢量是另一组
one set of vectors were the other set of

419
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,205
矢量这是一个矩阵，我做了它的SVD
vectors that's a matrix and I do its SVD

420
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:23,405
你的SigmaV转置如此倍增
u Sigma V transpose so so multiply this

421
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,735
x转换你给予的两个基础
x trans a two bases that you're given of

422
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,975
当然如果Y与X相同，如果是的话
course if Y was the same as X if it was

423
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,225
你有一个正交的基础
an orthogonal basis you'd have the

424
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,395
身份没有问题，但一般我们
identity no questions but generally we

425
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,835
它有一个SVD，我们正在寻找
have it has an SVD and we're looking for

426
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,255
对于最佳的正交矩阵
the for a orthogonal matrix of the best

427
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:53,115
问是不是我的意思是它是正确的
q is doesn't it I mean it's the right

428
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,545
四个惊奇表达的时间
time for four expressions of amazement

429
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:10,815
它是UV转置好的，所以
it is UV transpose okay so that so

430
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,035
这给了我们给出的答案x
that's gives us the answer we're given x

431
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,575
我们正在寻找最好的q和
and y we're looking for the best q and

432
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,035
答案来得最简单
the answer comes in the simplest

433
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,665
计算Y转置X的可能方式
possible way compute Y transpose X

434
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,475
计算其SVD并使用正交
compute its SVD and use the orthogonal

435
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,645
来自SVD的矩阵是的，我出去了
matrices from the SVD yeah and I'm out

436
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:37,985
时间如此证明它是三行
of time so so proof it's it's three line

437
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:44,025
以后要么要么发送给你
later either either to just send you the

438
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,605
在线部分或在课堂上讨论
section online or to discuss it in class

439
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,465
星期一，但我
Monday but I

440
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,975
我真的计划周一开始
I'm really planning Monday to start with

441
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,455
问题四，好好问一个问题
question four and being well to ask a

442
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,825
很多人我都能找到
whole lot of people everybody I can find

443
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,755
关于那个重要的问题是
about that important question is does

444
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,424
深度学习通常会起作用
deep learning usually work how what can

445
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,794
你要确保它有效或给予
you do to make sure it works or give

446
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,215
你自己有更好的机会让它发挥作用
yourself a better chance to have it work

447
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,100
so let's that's that's up for Monday

448
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,710
那就是周一的情况

449
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,710
那么好
then good
