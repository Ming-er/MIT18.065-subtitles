00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:28,144
所以最后一次是正交矩阵Q.
so last time was orthogonal matrices Q

10
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:33,105
而这一次是对称矩阵S左右
and this time is symmetric matrices s so

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,965
我们真的在谈论最好的
we're really talking about the best

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,045
所有的矩阵我都会从任何开始
matrices of all well I'll start with any

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,545
方阵和关于特征向量
square matrix and about eigenvectors but

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,705
你已经听说过特征向量
you've heard of eigenvectors more than

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,885
不止一次超过两倍以上
more than once more than twice more than

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,905
十次可能还好，所以特征向量
ten times probably okay so eigenvectors

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,234
然后让我们确定我们知道为什么
and then let's be sure we know why

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,305
它们很有用，可能会计算一个或
they're useful and maybe compute one or

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,025
两个但我们将转向对称
two but then we'll move to symmetric

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,545
矩阵和什么特别之处那些
matrices and what is special about those

21
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,985
然后更特别，更多
and then even more special and more

22
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,235
重要的是肯定的
important will be positive definite

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,745
对称矩阵，所以当我说
symmetric matrices so that when I say

24
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,415
肯定的我的意思是对称的
positive definite I mean symmetric so

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,495
从下一个开始然后来了
start with a next comes s then come the

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,365
特殊的对称矩阵
special s special symmetric matrices

27
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,154
有这个额外的肯定
that have this extra positive definite

28
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,645
属性好，所以从这样开始
property ok so start with a so an

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,415
特征向量，如果我乘以x得到我
eigenvector if i multiply a by x I get

30
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,735
一些矢量，有时候如果X是
some vector and sometimes if X is

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,695
特别选择好的斧头出来了
especially chosen well ax comes out in

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,835
与Xax相同的方向出来了
the same direction as X ax comes out

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,355
有些数倍X所以有
some number times X so there are

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,385
通常会有N乘n
normally there would be for an N by n

35
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,844
矩阵所以让我们说a是n乘n
matrix so let's let's say an a is n by n

36
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,445
今天
today

37
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,044
通常，如果我们生活在那里
normally if we're if we live right there

38
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,404
将是n个不同的独立向量
will be n different independent vectors

39
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:24,335
具有这种特殊性的XAugen载体
X Augen vectors that have this special

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,064
属性，我们可以手动计算它们
property and we can compute them by hand

41
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:35,824
如果n是2或3，但大多数是
if n is 2 or 3 to mostly but the

42
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:39,094
在X的计算和拉姆达等等
computation of the X's and the lambda so

43
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:46,264
这是因为我等于1到n
this is this is for I equal 1 up to n if

44
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,044
我用这种数学速记表示我
I use this sort of math shorthand that I

45
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:55,624
我和其中几乎总是有这些
have n of these almost always and my

46
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,255
第一个问题是他们有什么好处
first question is what are they good for

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,734
那么为什么选择课程呢？
well why why do just course after course

48
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,725
介绍了特征向量，并向我介绍了
introduced eigenvectors and to me the

49
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,715
通过查看a看到关键属性
key property is seen by looking at a

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,555
平方所以让我看看这样的平方
squared so let me look at a squared so

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,395
它是另一个N乘n矩阵，我们会
it's another N by n matrix and we would

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,734
问我们认识这些家伙
ask suppose we know these guys

53
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,085
假设我们发现了那些东西
suppose we found those somehow what

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,585
关于平方是X的特征向量
about a squared is X an eigen vector of

55
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,245
找平方也很方便
a squared also well the way to find out

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,604
是乘以X的平方并看到
is to multiply a squared by X and see

57
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,395
发生什么事，你看到了什么事情
what happens do you see what's going to

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,755
发生在这里这是一个时代的斧头
happen here this is a times ax which is

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,134
一次斧头是lambdaX，现在是什么
a times ax is lambda X and and now what

60
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,984
我现在该怎么办，因为我在拍摄
what do I do now because I'm shooting

61
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,865
对于答案，是x是特征向量
for the answer yes x is an eigenvector

62
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,314
平方也是如此，我该怎么做
of a squared also so what do I do that

63
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,594
lambda只是一个数字的数字
number that lambda is just a number

64
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,044
这就是我可以把它放在任何地方，我喜欢，所以我
that's I can put it anywhere I like so I

65
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,224
可以把它拿出来然后我有一个X.
can put it out front and then I have a X

66
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:18,724
这是lambdaX，谢谢我
which is lambda X thanks so I have

67
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,065
另一个lambdaX和lambda平方X一样
another lambda X so as lambda squared X

68
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,024
所以我这里学到的关键的东西
so I learned the crucial thing here that

69
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,384
X也是我
X is also an I

70
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,265
a平方矢量和特征值
vector of a-squared and the eigenvalue

71
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,115
是lambda平方，当然我可以
is lambda squared and of course I can

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,004
继续这么做到最后X是lambda
keep going so a to the end X is lambda

73
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:44,055
到最后X我们找到了正确的
to the end X we have found the right

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,515
该特定矩阵的向量a
vectors for that particular matrix a

75
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,224
怎么样的反X呢？
what about a inverse X that will be if

76
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:56,194
lambdaX上的一切都很好
everything is good one over lambda X

77
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,855
好吧是啊所以我随时写了一遍
well yeah so anytime I write 1 over

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,374
lambda我的脑子里说你要做的
lambda my mind says what you've got to

79
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,374
喜欢对特殊内容做一些评论
like make some comment on the special

80
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,395
情况下它不工作，这是耶
case where it doesn't work which is yeah

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,105
如果lambda不是0，那我就是lambda
if lambda is not 0 I'm golden if lambda

82
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,684
是0它看起来不太好但是它是什么
is 0 it doesn't look good and but what's

83
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:27,284
如果lambda为0，则发生嘿
happening if lambda is 0 hey doesn't

84
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:31,265
如果lambda为0，甚至有一个逆
even have an inverse if lambda was 0

85
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,985
这可能不是没有规则反对
which it could be no no no rule against

86
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,985
如果lambda为0，那么就会说a
it if lambda was 0 this would say a

87
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,654
特征向量的时间是0倍
times the eigenvector is 0 times the

88
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,724
特征向量，这样就可以告诉我
eigenvector so that would tell me that

89
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:47,745
特征向量在零空间中
the eigenvector is in the null space it

90
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,724
会告诉我矩阵a不是
would tell me that the matrix a isn't

91
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:52,844
可逆的它采取了一些向量X
invertible it's taking some vector X to

92
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:58,634
0等所以一切都点击这个
0 and so so the everything clicks this

93
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,254
它应该工作，如果我们有的话
works when it should work and if we have

94
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,015
其他字体矩阵的任何功能我们
other font any function of the matrix we

95
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,344
可以定义矩阵的指数
could define the exponential of a matrix

96
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:11,654
18:03会这样做让我们放手吧
18:03 would do that let's just let's

97
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,754
把它写下来好像我们知道它是什么
just write it down as if we know what it

98
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,904
意味着它具有相同的特征
means it does it have the same eigen

99
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,314
矢量很好肯定因为e到了T.
vector well sure because e to the a T

100
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,774
如果我看到矩阵的指数
exponential of a matrix if I see either

101
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,115
我想到的东西很久了
there's something I think of that long

102
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,274
无限系列给出了
infinite series that gives the

103
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,394
指数那些所有条款
exponential those all the terms in that

104
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,814
系列有一个这样的权力
series are have powers of a so

105
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,454
一切工作在每学期
everything is working every term in that

106
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,275
系列x是一个特征向量，当我
series x is an eigenvector and when I

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,435
这一切我都知道了
it all together I learned that the

108
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,955
特征值是e将拉姆达牛逼那
eigenvalue is e to the lambda T that's

109
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,335
只是一个典型而且成功的
just a typical and and and successful

110
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,615
工作用得好，所以我可以矢量
work use okay so that's I can vectors

111
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,235
和特征值，我们会发现一些
and eigen values and and we'll find some

112
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,425
现在在一分钟，所以我声称
in a minute now so I'm claiming that

113
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,335
从这开始就是这个
this is the this that from this first

114
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,065
就像某些事情一样
thing which was just like about certain

115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,525
现在我们开始向量是特殊的
vectors are special now we're beginning

116
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,645
看看为什么他们这么有用
to see why there why they're useful so

117
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,155
特别是好的有用的甚至更好，所以
special is good useful is even better so

118
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:35,675
所以让我拿任何矢量说V和
so let me take take any vector say V and

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,395
没事做我想做的事情我想用什么
okay what do I want to do I want to use

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,115
特征向量这个V可能不是
eigen vectors this V is probably not an

121
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,635
本征向量，但我想我已经
eigen vector but I'm supposing that I've

122
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,925
得到了他们，我同意了
got n of them you and I are agreed that

123
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,565
也有一些矩阵对此有
there are some matrices for which there

124
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,405
不是一整套特征向量
are not a full set of eigen vectors

125
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,914
这真的是主要的
that's really the the main sort of

126
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,185
整个主题的讨厌点
annoying point in the whole subject of

127
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,545
线性代数，因为一些矩阵没有
linear algebra as some matrices don't

128
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,865
有足够的特征向量，但几乎所有
have enough eigenvectors but almost all

129
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,895
做，让我们继续前进，假设我们的
do and let's go forward assuming our

130
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,235
矩阵没关系，所以如果我有n
matrix has okay so if I've got n

131
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,065
作为基础的独立特征向量
independent eigenvectors that's a basis

132
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,395
我可以写任何矢量V作为
I can write any vector V as a

133
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,145
这些特征向量的组合是正确的
combination of those eigen vectors right

134
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,425
然后我就可以找到了什么
and then I can find out what a to the to

135
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,974
任何权力，所以这就是这一点
any power so that's the point that this

136
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,775
这将是简单的和
is this is going to be simple and and

137
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,895
为什么我们喜欢它的原因有我们喜欢
the reason why we like to have we like

138
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,295
知道特征向量，因为如果我
to know the eigen vectors because if I

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,075
选择
choose

140
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,764
作为我的基础向量V是一个组合
as my basis vectors V is a combination

141
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,975
现在，如果我乘以a或a
of them now if I multiply by a or a

142
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,545
然后是平方或者是K的功率
squared or a to the K power then it's

143
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,665
线性所以我可以将每个乘以a
linear so I can multiply each one by a

144
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,545
到了K，如果我繁殖，我会得到什么
to the K and what do I get if I multiply

145
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,394
那个家伙对K的力量还不错
that guy by a to the K power okay well

146
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,394
我只是要使用或者我在这里开始但是
I'm just gonna use or here I set in but

147
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,954
让我说K和我很抱歉我正在使用n
let me say K and I'm sorry I'm using n

148
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,505
对于矩阵的大小，所以我更好
for the size of the matrix so I better

149
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,125
在这里使用K作为典型案例
use K for the for the typical case here

150
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,644
所以我得到了什么
so what do I get

151
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,225
只是为了帮助我完成这个和
just to help me through this and and

152
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,125
我们很高兴哦，所以当我发生时会发生什么
we're happy oh so what happens when I

153
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,625
乘以a到K就是a
multiply that by a to the K it's an

154
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,805
当我乘以时，特征向量记得这样
eigenvector remember so when I multiply

155
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,065
通过a到KI获得c1，这只是一个
by a to the K I get c1 that's just a

156
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,605
数和a到K倍的特征
number and a to the K times that eigen

157
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,805
向量给lambda1到K倍
vector gives lambda 1 to the K times the

158
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:06,584
特征向量权利就是整点
eigenvector right that's the whole point

159
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:13,215
和线性说继续Cnlambda
and linearity says keep going C n lambda

160
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,945
n到K幂X，换句话说我
n to the K power X and in other words I

161
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,774
我可以服用，我可以申请任何权力
have I can take I can apply any power of

162
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,445
矩阵我可以应用指数
a matrix I can apply the exponential of

163
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,024
矩阵我可以快速做任何事情
a matrix I can do anything quickly

164
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,355
因为我已经得到了特征向量
because I've got the eigen vector so

165
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,805
真的，所以我说第一次使用
really so I'm saying the first use for

166
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,115
特征向量可能是主要用途
eigen vectors may be the principle use

167
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,995
他们被发明的是
for which they were invented is to be

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,774
能够如此解决差分方程
able to solve difference equations so so

169
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:51,885
如果我称之为VK，那就让我吧
this so let me if I call that VK the

170
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,334
案件权力然后是我正在解决的等式
case power then the equation I'm solving

171
00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,764
这是一步差分方程
here is a one-step difference equation

172
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,095
这是我的差异方程，如果我
this is my difference equation and if I

173
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,735
想要使用指数的等式
wanted to use Exponential's the equation

174
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,995
我会被解决
I would be solving with

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,565
DVDT等于这些解决方案
DVD T equals a these solution to

176
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:26,375
离散步骤或连续时间
discrete steps or continuous time

177
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,395
如果我知道，进化是微不足道的
evolution comes is trivial if I know the

178
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,975
特征向量，因为这是解决方案
eigenvectors because here's the solution

179
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,035
这个和这个的解决方案
to this one and the solution to this one

180
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,365
是一回事C1e将拉姆达1吨
is the same thing c1 e to the lambda 1t

181
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,675
x1就是你所期望的
x1 is that what you were expecting for

182
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,635
这里的解决方案因为如果我
the for the solution here because if I

183
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,525
采取它带来的衍生物
take the derivative it brings down a

184
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,215
lambda如果我乘以它会降低
lambda if I multiply by a it brings down

185
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:08,735
lambda以及其他人还好吧
the lambda so plus the other guys okay

186
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,925
不是新闻，但要记住什么是重要的
not news but important to remember what

187
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,845
特征向量首先用于
eigenvectors are for in the first place

188
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,985
好啊，让我继续前进
good yeah let me move ahead

189
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,865
哦，一个矩阵
oh one one matrix

190
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,965
事实是关于类似的东西
fact is about something called similar

191
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,265
矩阵，所以我在我的矩阵上然后我
matrices so I have on my matrix a then I

192
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,275
了解它意味着什么
have the idea of what it means to be

193
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:52,834
类似于A所以B类似于a或
similar to a so B is similar to a or

194
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,375
是的，这意味着什么呢？
yeah what does that mean so here's

195
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,445
这就是它首先意味着什么
here's what it means first of all it

196
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,605
意味着B可以从中找到
means that B can be found from a by this

197
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,055
在按键操作这里乘以
is the key operation here multiplying by

198
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,005
矩阵M及其逆M逆am
a matrix M and its inverse M inverse am

199
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,985
当我看到两个矩阵B和A.
when I see two matrices B an A

200
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,885
通过那种方式连接起来的
that are connected by that kind of a

201
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,245
改变M可以是任何可逆矩阵
change M could be any invertible matrix

202
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,375
然后我会说是类似的一天
then I would say be with similar day and

203
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,255
那改变了那种外表
that changed that that that appearance

204
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,555
如果我改变，M很自然
of M is pretty natural if I change

205
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,935
这里的变量是M然后我得到了
variables here by M then I get that

206
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,225
类似的矩阵会显示出来的是什么
similar matrix will show up so what's

207
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,955
关键事实你还记得钥匙
the key fact do you remember the key

208
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,545
关于类似矩阵的事实，如果B和a
fact about similar matrices if B and a

209
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,325
连接一样，他们有
are connected like that they have the

210
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,385
相同的特征值所以这只是一个
same eigenvalues so this is a just a

211
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,125
有用的一点要记住，所以我会这
useful point to remember so I'll this is

212
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,215
就像在讨论中的一个事实
like one fact in the in the discussion

213
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,235
特征向量的等等
of eigenvalues and eigenvectors so

214
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:36,285
类似的矩阵具有相同的特征值
similar matrices same eigenvalues

215
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,315
是的，以某种方式在特征值
yeah so in in some way in the eigenvalue

216
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,155
特征向量世界他们就在这里
eigenvector world they're there in this

217
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,495
他们在一起，他们是
they belong together they they're

218
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,125
通过这种关系连接起来
connected by is by this relation that

219
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,195
结果证明是正确的事情
just turns out to be the right thing

220
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,605
实际上就是它给了我们一个线索
actually that is it gives us a clue of

221
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,084
如何实际计算特征值
how eigenvalues are actually computed

222
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,975
好吧，他们实际上是通过打字来计算的
well they're actually computed by typing

223
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,774
我用括号围绕着那个
I of a with parentheses around a that's

224
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:18,265
他们在现实生活中的表现如何
how they're in in real life but what

225
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,285
当你打字的时候我会给你一个好的
happens when you type I give a well you

226
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,235
可以说特征值出现在
could say the eigenvalue shows up on the

227
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,685
屏幕，但必须发生一些事情
screen but something had to happen in

228
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,045
那里
there

229
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,144
发生了什么事是MATLAB或
and what happened it was that MATLAB or

230
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:38,954
那个拿着那个矩阵的人开始使用了
whoever took that matrix a started using

231
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:47,005
M的很好的选择好你
good choices of M better and better you

232
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,765
知道采取了一堆步骤
know took a bunch of steps with

233
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,985
不同的M是因为如果我做另一个M.
different M's because if I do another M

234
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,625
如果我，我仍然有一个类似的矩阵
I still have a similar matrix right if I

235
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,415
如果我拿B并做一个不同的M2到B.
if I take B and do a different M 2 to B

236
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,155
所以我得到类似B，则事
so I get something similar to B then

237
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,255
这也和我的方式类似
that's also similar to way I've got a

238
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,495
那里有类似事物的全家人
whole family of similar things there and

239
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,405
它与MATLAB的作用是什么
what does it what does MATLAB do with

240
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,524
所有这些M和1和M2和M3和
all these M's and 1 and M 2 and M 3 and

241
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:20,665
所以它将矩阵带到三角形
so on it brings the matrix to triangular

242
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,355
矩阵
matrix

243
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,415
它得到了特征值
it gets the eigenvalues showing up on

244
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,965
对角线它非常棒
the diagonal it's just tremendously it

245
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,445
是那时的灵感
was the inspiration when that when there

246
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,815
当M的好选择出现时
when the good choice of M appeared and

247
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,235
我只想说，因为我要去上
let me just say because I'm going on to

248
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,175
对称矩阵，对称矩阵
symmetric matrices that for symmetric

249
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,454
矩阵一切都有点清洁
matrices everything is sort of cleaned

250
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,174
你不是不只是去
you're not you not only go to

251
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,794
三角形矩阵你朝着它去
triangular matrix you go to it toward a

252
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,004
对角矩阵它们让你厌烦
diagonal matrix they off tire you you

253
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,194
选择制作非对角线的M'
choose M's that make the off-diagonal

254
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,905
越来越小的东西
stuff smaller and smaller and smaller

255
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,994
并且特征值没有改变
and the eigenvalues are not changing so

256
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,334
他们在对角线上射击了
they're shooting up on the diagonal are

257
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,115
特征值，所以我想我应该
the eigenvalues so I guess I should

258
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,514
验证类似矩阵的事实
verify that fact that similar matrices

259
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,875
具有相同的特征值可以有
have the same eigen values can be there

260
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,975
不能表明我们不能太多
can't be much to show we can't be much

261
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,944
在证明中，因为这就是我所知道的
in the proof because that's all I know

262
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:26,605
我想知道它的特征值和
and I want to know its eigenvalues and

263
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,125
特征向量让我说假设m
eigenvectors so let me say suppose m

264
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,235
逆am具有特征向量Y和
inverse a m has the eigen vector Y and

265
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:42,115
本征值拉姆达，我想
the eigen value lambda and I want to

266
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,284
我想表明Y是一个
show do I want to show that Y is an

267
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:49,725
特征向量也是一个自己没有
eigen vector also of a itself no

268
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,705
特征向量正在改变我想做什么
eigenvectors are changing do I want to

269
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,345
表明中λ为的特征值
show that lambda is an eigenvalue of a

270
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,335
本身是的，这是我的观点所以我们可以看到
itself yes that's my point so can we see

271
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,235
那我可以看到lambda是一个
that huh can I see that lambda is an

272
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,664
特征值就像那里没有
eigenvalue there's like there's not a

273
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,335
我要做的很多，我的意思是，如果我不能这样做
lot to do here I mean if I can't do it

274
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,414
很快，我从来没有打算这样做，因为这样
soon I'm never going to do it because so

275
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:18,585
我该怎么办，是的，我可以
what am I going to do yeah I could yeah

276
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,924
X是我的关键，我可以
X is my is going to be a key and I can

277
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:25,794
当我看到M逆时，看到我的到来
see my coming just when I see M inverse

278
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,475
在那里或我将要做什么
over there or what am I going to do with

279
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,745
这件坏事我会把它放在上面
the darn thing I'm gonna put it on the

280
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,394
另一方面，我会倍增
other side I'm gonna multiply that

281
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:36,144
M的等式，所以我会有
equation by M so I'll have that we'll

282
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:40,845
把M放在这里，我会有一个My
put the M over here and I'll have a M y

283
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:49,075
等于lambda我的权利就是这样
equals lambda M Y right and is that

284
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,014
告诉我我想知道的是什么
telling me what I want to know yes

285
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:55,585
那是明智地说我的意思
that's saying that my that you wisely

286
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,065
建议给名字x2是lambda
suggested to given name x2 is lambda

287
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,575
我见到你了吗？
times my do you see that that

288
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,424
特征值lambda没有
that the eigen value lambda didn't

289
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,294
改变特征向量确实改变了它
change the eigenvector did change it

290
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,644
从Y改为我的那就是X了
changed from Y to my that's the X the

291
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:19,034
X的特征向量这是lambdaX是的
eigenvector of X this is lambda X yeah

292
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,105
所以这就是M的作用
so that's the role of M it just it just

293
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,294
给你一个不同的基础
gives you a different basis for

294
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,725
特征向量，但它不会改变
eigenvectors but it does not change

295
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,825
正确的价值是的，所以那些
eigen values right yeah okay so those

296
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,845
是类似的矩阵是的其他一些
are similar matrices yeah some other

297
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,735
好事发生在很多人身上
good things happened a lot of people

298
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,855
其实我不是很喜欢
don't know in fact I wasn't like very

299
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,215
意识到B时代的事实
conscious of the fact that a times B has

300
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,544
与B次相同的特征值
the same eigen values as B times a well

301
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:50,654
我是你也许我应该写下来
I'm you I should maybe write that down a

302
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:58,284
B具有相同的特征值
B has the same eigen values the same

303
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:01,945
非零，一旦你知道你会看到我有
nonzero once you know you'll see I have

304
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:09,894
两个作为这是任何a和B相同
two as be a this is any a and B same

305
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:12,355
大小我不是在说类似的矩阵
size I'm not talking similar matrices

306
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:19,375
这里我说的任何两个和B呀等等
here I'm talking any two a and B yeah so

307
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,975
这是现在发生的好事
that's a good thing that happens now

308
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,355
我们能不能看到一个，然后我就是
could we could we see one and then I'm

309
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,465
基本的，真的很开心
gonna be really pretty happy with basic

310
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,774
关于特征值的事实如此，如果我想要的话
facts about eigen values so so if I want

311
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,185
表明两两件事有相同
to show that two things have the same

312
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,924
特征值你的建议是什么
eigen values what what do you propose

313
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,154
表明他们已经相似了
show that they are similar I already

314
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,255
说如果它们相似，那么是否有M.
said if they're similar so is there an M

315
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,185
有没有M将连接这个
is there an M that will connect this

316
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,325
矩阵所以有一个M会
matrix so is there an M that will

317
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,995
乘这个矩阵方式，使
multiply this matrix that way so that

318
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,394
可能类似于B而且我可以
would be similar to a B and can I

319
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:15,924
然后产生B.
produce B a then

320
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:22,374
所以我只想把这个词放在这里我
so I'll just put the word want up here I

321
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:28,174
我想，如果我有，那我就完成了
want if I if I have that then I'm done

322
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,304
因为那就是那两个
because that's saying that those two

323
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:33,574
矩阵B和BA是相似的，我
matrices a B and BA are similar and I

324
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:35,464
知道那时候他们也一样
know that then they have the same

325
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:41,644
特征值所以它们应该是mbm
eigenvalues so are they what should mb m

326
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:49,894
应该是这样，我想要的是什么
should be so what does I am here I want

327
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:59,074
这是真的应该是我是一个人
that to be true should mb be yeah a me

328
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,774
男孩不是最隐蔽的事实
will be boy not the most hidden fact

329
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:11,914
拿这个取m等于B然后我就B了
here take take m equal B so then I've B

330
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,364
次次BB逆这是
times a times B B inverse which is the

331
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:18,804
身份所以我有B时间说是的好
identity so I have B time say yes okay

332
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:26,014
所以b-and-ba很好没有做什么
so so a b-and-b a are fine no what do

333
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,684
你想到这个问题是
you think about this question are the

334
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:31,684
特征行我现在知道一个B＆Ba
eigen rows I now know that a B & B a of

335
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:34,114
相同的特征值和原因我
the same eigen values and the reason I

336
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:40,624
不得不小心非零
had to be careful about non zero is that

337
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:46,894
如果我的特征值为零，那我就是我
if I had zero eigen values then yeah I I

338
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,534
不能指望那些逆转的权利
can't count on those inverses right

339
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:54,274
对，所以这就是我投入的原因
right so so that's why I put in that

340
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,944
小资格赛，但现在我想问
little qualifier but now I want to ask

341
00:22:56,949 --> 00:23:00,304
这个问题，如果我知道特征值
this question if I know the eigenvalues

342
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:05,644
现在分别由a和B分开
of a separately by itself a and of B now

343
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:07,654
我正在谈论任何两个矩阵a和
I'm talking about any two matrices a and

344
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:13,174
B如果我有两个矩阵a和我有
B if if I have two matrices a and I have

345
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:15,814
矩阵A和矩阵B，我知道
a matrix a and a matrix B and I know

346
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,524
那些是我可以在他们的价值观
those are I can values in their

347
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:23,284
特征值B一次B可以怎么样
eigenvalues what about a B a times B can

348
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,384
我乘以时间的特征值
I multiply the eigenvalues of a time's

349
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:26,875
b的特征值
the eigenvalues of b

350
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,205
不要做对了是对的特征值
don't do it right yes right eigen values

351
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,544
一次B的特征值可以
of a times the eigen values of B could

352
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,404
什么都不对，他们不是
be damn near anything right they're not

353
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:39,904
连接到B的特征值
connected to the eigen values of a B

354
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:43,565
特别是在某些东西可能
especially in maybe some something could

355
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,205
被发现但不是很多，同样如此
be discovered but not much and similarly

356
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:53,345
为了加号B，所以是的，所以让我
for a plus B that so yeah so so let me

357
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,414
只记下这一点，我给出了价值观
just write down this point I give values

358
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:00,455
加B的一般不是本征的
of a plus B are generally not eigen

359
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:08,185
中的值再加上我的价值观
values of a plus I in values of be

360
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,945
通常不只是没有理由和
generally not just there's no reason and

361
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,815
他们是我得到的原因
they're the reason that that's I get

362
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,195
没有答案是特征向量可以
that no answer is the eigen vectors can

363
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,935
是所有不同的，如果特征向量
be all different if the eigen vectors

364
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,274
对于一个完全不同的
for a are totally different from the

365
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,544
B的本征向量然后加上B将
eigen vectors for B then a plus B will

366
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,735
可能还有其他一些
have probably some other totally

367
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,524
不同的特征向量和那里
different eigen vectors and there's

368
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:38,554
没有什么事情发生在那里
nothing nothing happening there there's

369
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,335
关于本征的那种想法
that sort of a thoughts about eigen

370
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,054
总的来说，我可以有一个
values in general and I could there be a

371
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:51,054
关于特征向量的整个部分，但我是
whole section on eigen vectors but I'm

372
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,174
对...的特征向量真正感兴趣
really interested in eigenvectors of

373
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,154
对称矩阵所以我要移动
symmetric matrices so I'm going to move

374
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:04,924
关于这个话题所以现在已经谈过了
on to that topic so now having talked

375
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:07,445
关于我要专攻的任何矩阵
about any matrix a I'm gonna specialize

376
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,595
对称矩阵看看有什么特别之处
to symmetric matrices see what's special

377
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,845
关于特征值是什么的
about the eigenvalues are there what's

378
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,885
特别关于那里的特征向量
special about the eigenvectors there and

379
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,924
我想我们已经在课堂上说过了
i think we've already said it in class

380
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:20,044
所以让我让我问你告诉我
so let me let me ask you to tell me

381
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:22,144
关于它再次告诉我所以我会打电话给你
about it tell me again so I'll call that

382
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:26,794
矩阵现在总是提醒你
matrix s now as a reminder always that

383
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,505
我在这里谈论对称性
I'm talking here about symmetric

384
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,715
矩阵那么我的关键是什么
matrices so what do i what are the key

385
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:40,655
事实要知道我的价值观是真实的
facts to know I can values are real

386
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,445
如果矩阵是我的实数
real numbers if the matrix is I'm

387
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,125
关于实对称矩阵的思考
thinking of real symmetric matrices of

388
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,115
当然其他真正的矩阵可能有
course other real matrices could have

389
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,085
虚构的特征值其他真正的主要
imaginary eigenvalues other real major

390
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,095
所以，让我们想一下
so just let's just think for a moment

391
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,865
是的，也许我会把它放在这里，我可以
yeah maybe I'll just put it here can I

392
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:08,325
在我继续前进之前回来
back up before I keep going with

393
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,405
对称矩阵所以采用矩阵
symmetric matrices so so take a matrix

394
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:21,165
赞赞赞是Q是啊，这将是
like like like that Q yeah that would be

395
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,555
一个Q，但它不是特别是Q也许是
a Q but it's not specially a Q maybe the

396
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,075
也许是最引人注目的事情
maybe the most remarkable thing about

397
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,585
那个矩阵是反对称的
that matrix is that it's anti-symmetric

398
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,855
如果我，我会称之为正确
so I'll call it a for right if I

399
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,015
转置那个矩阵我得到了什么
transpose that matrix what do I get

400
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,175
负面因此就像反对
there negative so that's like anti

401
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,725
对称，我声称反对
symmetric and I claim that an anti

402
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,335
对称矩阵具有虚构
symmetric matrix has imaginary

403
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,695
特征值，这就是那个
eigenvalues so that's a that's a that's

404
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,005
你可能会说90度旋转
a 90 degree rotation and you might say

405
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,405
有什么能比这更简单的90
what could be simpler than that a 90

406
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,145
学位轮换并不奇怪
degree rotation that's not a weird

407
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,145
矩阵，但从的角度来看
matrix but from the point of view of

408
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,225
特征向量有些奇怪的东西
eigenvectors some things little odd has

409
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,855
发生在正确，因为如果我有一个90
to happen right because if I have a 90

410
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,645
如果我采用矢量X任何一个程度旋转
degree rotation if I take a vector X any

411
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,855
矢量X它可能是一个
vector X could it possibly be an

412
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,225
特征向量很好地适用于你
eigenvector well apply a to it you'd be

413
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,065
朝这个方向走了一个X而且有
off in this direction a X and there is

414
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,525
没有办法，一个X可以是X的倍数
no way that a X can be a multiple of X

415
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,535
所以有这个问题并没有真正的特征向量
so there's no real eigenvector for that

416
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,205
对于那个反对称矩阵或任何
for that anti-symmetric matrix or any

417
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,315
反对称矩阵是的，所以你看
anti symmetric matrix yep so you see

418
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,245
当我们说的是特征值时
that when we say that the eigenvalues of

419
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,305
我们说的是对称矩阵
a symmetric matrix are real we're saying

420
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,525
这可能不会发生这
that this couldn't happen that this

421
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,045
如果它们是对称的，就不可能发生
couldn't happen if they were symmetric

422
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,085
在这里它是一个非常相反的
and here it's a very opposite it's

423
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:58,065
反对称井即好
antisymmetric well well that's on the

424
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,835
董事会你可能会说等一下如何
board you might say wait a minute how

425
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,365
可能有任何特征向量
could that have any eigenvector

426
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,425
什么是什么是特征向量
whatsoever so what is an eigenvector of

427
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,065
那个矩阵你怎么找到的
that matrix a how do you find the

428
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,725
当它们是两个时的特征向量
eigenvectors of a when they're two by

429
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,025
这是我们知道如何计算的两个
two that's a calculation we know how to

430
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,855
你还记得那里的那些台阶吗？
do you remember the steps there I'm

431
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,015
寻找斧头等于lambdaX如此正确
looking for ax equal lambda X so right

432
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,625
现在我正在寻找两个lambda附件
now I'm looking for both lambda annex

433
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,945
我有两个
I've got two

434
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,365
这不是线性的，但我会带来的
that's not linear but I'm gonna bring

435
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,855
这个到了这一边并写成一个
this over to this side and write it as a

436
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,575
减去lambdaIX等于零然后
minus lambda I X equal to zero and then

437
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,945
我在那得看和说哇
I'm gonna look at that and say wow a

438
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,155
减去lambda我必须是不可逆的
minus lambda I must be not invertible

439
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,585
因为它的空值为X.
because it's got this X in its null

440
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,435
空间因此决定了这个矩阵
space so the determinant of this matrix

441
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:02,895
必须为零我不能为空
must be zero I couldn't have a null

442
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,415
空间，这是决定因素是零
space and that's the determinant is zero

443
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,535
然后当我看一个减去lambda我
and then when I look at a minus lambda I

444
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:19,755
对于这个我有减去lambdas-嘿
for this a I've got minus lambdas - hey

445
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,475
哦，它只是一个，那是减一
oh it's just a one and that's minus one

446
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,535
我要采取决定因素和什么
I'm gonna take the determinant and what

447
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,245
我是否会选择决定因素
am I going to get for the determinant

448
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:37,305
lambda平方加一，我设定了
lambda squared plus one and I set that

449
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:43,335
为零
to zero

450
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:48,175
所以我只是遵循所有规则但是
so I'm just following all the rules but

451
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,865
它向我展示了lambda这两个
it's showing me that the lambda the two

452
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,315
lambdas这里有两个lambdas但是
lambdas there are two lambdas here but

453
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,415
他们不是真的，因为那个等式
they're not real because that equation

454
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:03,265
根源是我和减去我所以那些
the roots are I and minus I so those are

455
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,425
特征值，它们很好
the eigenvalues and they have the nice

456
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,795
他们一切都很好
they have all the well they are the

457
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,685
特征值毫无疑问与
eigenvalues no doubt about it with

458
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,015
两个两个快速检查
two-by-two there are two quick checks

459
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,815
告诉你是的你做了
that tell you yeah you did the

460
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,265
如果我添加了两种计算权
calculation right if I add up the two

461
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:32,845
如果我把这两个加起来，那么这个特征值
eigenvalues in this if I add up the two

462
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,975
任何矩阵的特征值，我要去
eigenvalues for any matrix and I'm going

463
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,215
为这个做这件事，我得到了答案
to do it for this one I get what answer

464
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,685
我从添加中得到了相同的答案
I get the same answer from the adding

465
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,515
添加lambdas给我的添加
add the add the lambdas gives me the

466
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,025
添加对角线的答案相同
same answer as add the diagonal of the

467
00:30:54,030 --> 00:31:00,265
如果我添加，我正在调用的矩阵
matrix which I'm calling a so if I add

468
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,505
对角线我得零和零所以它是
the diagonal I get zero and zero so it's

469
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:09,235
零加零和这个数字加
zero plus zero and this number adding

470
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,555
对角线称为迹线和
the diagonal is called the trace and

471
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,875
我们会再次看到它，因为它就是这样
we'll see it again because it's so

472
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,995
简单只需添加对角线项
simple just adding the diagonal entries

473
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,465
在什么时候给你一些关键信息
gives you a key bit of information when

474
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,685
你加下来对角线它告诉你
you add down the diagonal it tells you

475
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,665
本征值拉姆达的总和它
the sum of the eigen value lambda it

476
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,365
不会分别告诉你每个lambda
doesn't tell you each lambda separately

477
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,455
但它会告诉你总和所以它会告诉你
but it tells you the sum so it tells you

478
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,085
通过做一件事情啊这么一个事实
one fact by doing one thing yeah so

479
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,745
这非常方便，给你一个快速
that's pretty handy gives you a quick

480
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,345
检查，如果你知道你的自行车，当你
check if you've you know bike when you

481
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,475
计算这个决定因素并求解
compute this determinant and solve for

482
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,275
拉姆达
lambda

483
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:00,425
你这是一种计算方式
the thing you this is a way to compute

484
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,935
手工特征值你可以做一个
eigenvalues by hand you could make a

485
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,425
错误，因为它是二次方程式
mistake because it's a quadratic formula

486
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:12,455
对于2x2，但您可以通过添加
for 2x2 but you can check by adding the

487
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,755
两个根你得到的相同吗？
two roots do you get the same as the

488
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,005
跟踪0加0，还有另外一个
trace 0 plus 0 well there's one other

489
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,315
同样快速检查2乘222
check equally quick for 2 by 2 so 2 by 2

490
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,255
你是真的让他们正确的是什么
is you really get them right what's the

491
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,735
其他检查2我们添加我们的特征值
other check 2 we add the eigen values we

492
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,485
得到我们乘以特征的轨迹
get the trace we multiply the eigen

493
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,575
价值所以我们现在这样做，所以我会
values so we take so so now I'll

494
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:46,595
乘以lambdas然后我得到我
multiply the lambdas so then I get I

495
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,455
时间减去我和那应该相等
times minus I and that should equal

496
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,265
让我们看看它应该是什么
let's don't look yet what should it

497
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,145
如果我乘以特征值I则相等
equal if I multiply the eigen values I

498
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:09,755
应该得到一个决定权
should get the determinant right of a so

499
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,295
这2个方便的检查添加了本征
that's 2 handy checks add the eigen

500
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,355
任何尺寸3乘以34乘4的值但是
values for any size 3 by 3 4 by 4 but

501
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,615
这只是2次检查
it's only 2 checks

502
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,425
所以42比2它是你得到它的那种3
so 4 2 by 2 it's kind of you got it 3 by

503
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,645
34比4你仍然可以做到
3 4 by 4 you could still have made an

504
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,215
错误和两个检查可以
error and the two checks could

505
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,155
可能仍然工作让我们检查一下
potentially still work let's just check

506
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,415
它在这里是什么，我减去我1
it out here what's I times minus I 1

507
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,095
因为它是负的我平方而且那是
because it's minus I squared and that's

508
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,405
加上1和它的决定因素
plus 1 and the determinant of that

509
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,405
矩阵是0减去1是的
matrix is 0 minus is 1 yep

510
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:54,035
好的，所以我们得到了一个好的，真的
ok so we got one good those are really

511
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,315
关于特征值，但关键事实
the key facts about eigenvalues but of

512
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,645
当然，他们不是不是
course the they're not it's not as

513
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,924
简单的解决斧头等于B找到
simple as solving ax equal B to find

514
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:08,105
他们，但如果你跟随它
them but it's if you follow

515
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:14,575
关于类似矩阵的概念和
on this idea of similar matrices and

516
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,645
那种砍下非对角线
sort of chopped down the off-diagonal

517
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,775
部分然后确定特征值
part then sure enough the eigenvalues

518
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,325
好好表现出来
got to show up okay

519
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:34,055
对称对称矩阵现在好了
symmetric symmetric matrices okay so now

520
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,215
我们将具有对称性然后
we're going to have symmetric and then

521
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,885
我们的特殊性甚至比
we'll have the special even better than

522
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,115
对称是对称的正定
symmetric is symmetric positive-definite

523
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,095
好吧对称你告诉我主要的
okay symmetric you told me the main

524
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:56,825
事实是特征值真实的本征
facts are the eigenvalues real the eigen

525
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:09,505
矢量正交，我猜其实
vectors orthogonal and I guess actually

526
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:15,125
是的所以我想把这个拿走
yeah so I want to put the take to put

527
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:21,565
那些成为数学符号而不是单词
those into math symbols instead of words

528
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:28,835
所以是的，我猜是的，我只是
so yeah yeah I guess yeah shall I just

529
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,575
跳进去，隐藏另一件事
jump in and the other other thing hidden

530
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,115
那里但是非常重要的是有
there but but very important is there's

531
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,535
一套完整的特征向量，即使有些
a full set of eigenvectors even if some

532
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,545
特征值碰巧被重复像
eigenvalues happen to be repeated like

533
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,575
身份矩阵仍然充足
the identity matrix it still got plenty

534
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,355
特征向量，这是一个附加点
of eigenvectors so that's an added point

535
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,265
我不是在那里制造的，我会尽我所能
that I'm not made there and I'll I could

536
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,115
证明这两个陈述，但为什么不
prove those two statements but why don't

537
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:01,795
我请你接受它们并继续前进
I ask you to accept them and go onward

538
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,195
我们该怎么跟他们没关系和
what are we gonna do with them okay and

539
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,324
是啊
yeah

540
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,064
好吧，你能不能让我们拥有一个
okay can you just like let's have an

541
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:17,745
例如刚起来让我把一个例子
example just up let me put an example

542
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,695
这里假设非调用它是零
here suppose s non calling it s is zeros

543
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:30,435
1＆1这样它的对称性是什么
1 & 1 so that's symmetric what are its

544
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,245
特征值是什么特征值
eigenvalues what are the eigenvalues of

545
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:40,655
对称矩阵的正负1
that symmetric matrix s plus and minus 1

546
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,755
那么，如果你打算特征值我会
well if you propose to eigenvalues I'll

547
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,935
把它们写下来1和减去1然后
write them down 1 and minus 1 and then

548
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,525
我该怎么做才能检查它们的痕迹和
what will I do to check them trace and

549
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,025
决定性的确定他们是或是真的
determinant ok so are they or is it true

550
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,875
特征值为1和-1
that the eigenvalues are 1 and minus 1

551
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,334
好吧，我如何检查跟踪是什么
okay how do I check the trace what is

552
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:08,985
那个矩阵0的痕迹和什么的
the trace of that matrix 0 and what's

553
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,675
特征值的总和0好什么
the sum of the eigenvalues 0 good what

554
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,775
关于确定什么是决定因素
about determinate what's the determinant

555
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,195
s减1的乘积
of s minus 1 the product of the

556
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,895
特征值减1，所以我们已经没事了
eigenvalues minus 1 so we've got it ok

557
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,165
哪些特征向量是什么向量
what are the eigenvectors what vector

558
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,475
你可以乘以它而不是它
can you multiply by and it doesn't

559
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,395
改变方向实际上并没有改变
change direction in fact doesn't change

560
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,495
我正在寻找特征向量
at all i'm looking for the eigenvector

561
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,235
这是一个稳定的状态01
that's a steady state 0 1

562
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,995
我认为这是11是的所以这里是
I think it's 1 1 yeah so here's the

563
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,505
lambda表达式，然后特征向量是我
lambdas and then the eigenvectors are I

564
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:55,005
认为11是正确的，是的，确定SS是
think 1 1 is that right yeah sure SS is

565
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,405
这只是一种排列而已
just a permutation here it's just

566
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,074
交换这两个条目以便一对一交换
exchanging the two entries so one on one

567
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,834
不会改变，另一个是什么
won't change and what what's the other

568
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:13,445
特征向量1和负1
eigenvector 1 and minus 1

569
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,075
然后我在想着记住
and then I'm thinking remembering about

570
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,705
我认为这是类似的东西
this similar stuff I'm thinking that a s

571
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:28,094
类似于刚刚显示的矩阵
is similar to a matrix that just shows

572
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:31,785
特征值所以s类似于我
the eigenvalues so s is similar to I'm

573
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,995
我要去M井
going to put in an M well I'm going to

574
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,385
用那个矩阵连接那个矩阵
connect s that matrix with the

575
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,055
具有的特征值矩阵
eigenvalue matrix which has the

576
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:51,584
特征值所以这里是我的每个人的电话
eigenvalues so here's my everybody calls

577
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:54,104
矩阵资本lambda因为
that matrix capital lambda because

578
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:56,745
每个人都很少调用特征值
everybody calls the eigenvalues little

579
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,225
lambda所以有它们的矩阵是
lambda so the matrix that has them is

580
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,525
叫做资本lambda，我的主张是
called capital lambda and I my claim is

581
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,125
这些家伙是相似的，这
that these guys are similar that this

582
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,315
你在那里看到的矩阵我
matrix s that you're seeing up there I

583
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,065
相信有一个MI相信有
believe there's an M I believe there's

584
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:17,655
一个M所以我在这里放了什么呢
an M so that s what did I put in here so

585
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,785
我下面的这个模式，我相信
I'm following this pattern I believe

586
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,515
会有M和M
that there would be an M and an M

587
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,245
反使这将意味着，和
inverse so that this would mean that and

588
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,364
这首先很好，就是这样
that's nice first of all it's it would

589
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,975
确认特征值保持不变
confirm that the eigenvalues stay the

590
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,854
这其中这是一定相同
same which which which was certain to

591
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:40,185
发生，然后它也意味着
happen and then it would also mean that

592
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,905
我曾经有一个对角矩阵和
I had got a diagonal matrix and of

593
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,915
当然，这是一个自然的目标
course that's a natural goal to get a

594
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,265
对角矩阵所以我们可能希望如此
diagonal matrix so we might hope that

595
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:54,905
让我们到达那里的M就像一个
the M that gets us there is like an

596
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,455
重要的矩阵所以你看到我是什么
important matrix so do you see what I'm

597
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,864
在这里做它是在标题下
doing here it comes under the heading of

598
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:04,935
对角化矩阵我从一开始
diagonalizing a matrix I start with a

599
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,195
矩阵s我发现它们的特征值
matrix s I find its eigenvalues they go

600
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,915
进入lambda，我相信我能找到
on into lambda and I believe I can find

601
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,575
一个M，所以我看到他们是相似的
an M so that I see there they're similar

602
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,065
它们具有相同的特征值1和-1
they have the same eigen values 1 and -1

603
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,065
双方都是如此
both sides so only

604
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,005
在的问题是什么在什么是
in question is what's in what's the

605
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:34,635
矩阵，对角化了所拥有的东西
matrix that diagonalizes s the what have

606
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,195
我们离开了使用特征向量
we got left to use the eigenvectors the

607
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,555
矩阵，所以我可以把M喜欢
matrix that so can I put the M like over

608
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,195
是的，我会把那个余烬逆
there yeah I'll put that ember inverse

609
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,755
我要去另一边哦
is going to go over to the other side oh

610
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,005
它在这里并不涉及我们
it goes here doesn't involve us I was

611
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,435
我担心那里看起来不太好看
like worried there I didn't look good

612
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,365
但是，所以这一切都将成为现实
but yeah so so this is all going to be

613
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:09,015
权利，如果这是不是想我来
right if if this is what I'd like to

614
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,885
SIm等于mlambdasm等于m
have SI m equal m lambda s m equal m

615
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,955
拉姆达
lambda

616
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,235
那是对齐矩阵的
that's diagonalizing a matrix that's

617
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,225
使用特征向量找到m
finding the m using the eigenvectors

618
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,845
产生类似的矩阵λ
that produces a similar matrix lambda

619
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,735
其中有一个是这样的特征值
which has the eigenvalues that that's

620
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:33,395
这是关于的重要事实
that's the great fact about

621
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,975
对角化就是你如何使用它
diagonalizing that's how you use that's

622
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,625
另一种说法是这样的
another way to say this is how the

623
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,565
特征向量可以让你付出代价
eigenvectors pay off you put them into m

624
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,175
你采取类似的矩阵，它
you take the similar matrix and it's

625
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,605
很好，对角线，你看到了吗？
nice and diagonal and do you see that

626
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,575
这将发生在时间，所以M有
this will happen s time so M has the

627
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,365
第一特征向量和第二特征向量
first eigen vector and the second eigen

628
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,865
矢量，我相信第一个
vector and I believe that the first

629
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,315
特征向量x结束时的第二个
eigenvector x the second at end the

630
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,415
第二个特征向量再次出现
second eigenvector that's am again on

631
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,885
这边没有我只是写在100
this side no me just write in the 1 0 0

632
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:16,085
减1我相信这就好了
minus 1 I believe this got to be like

633
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,015
确认我们已经完成了他们的事情
confirming that we've done their thing

634
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,225
正确确认特征向量
right confirming that the eigen vectors

635
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,515
在这里工作可以就像请做
work here could just like please make

636
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,555
当你看到时，从最后一行感觉到
sense out of that last line when you see

637
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,555
最后一行我的意思是什么
that last line how what do I mean to

638
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,985
理解我想看到的东西
make sense out of it what I want to see

639
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,104
这是真的，我怎么看
that that's true how do I see that

640
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:41,834
我怎么做这样左边的是什么
how do I do this so what's the left side

641
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,734
什么是正确的一面，如果是的话
and what's the right side so what if if

642
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:51,965
我将s乘以几列
I multiply s by a couple of columns

643
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,455
答案是什么
what's the answer

644
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,764
SX1和sx2是美的
SX 1 and s x2 that's the beauty of

645
00:42:57,769 --> 00:43:00,344
矩阵乘法，如果我乘以a
matrix multiplication if I multiply a

646
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:02,564
矩阵由另一个矩阵我可以做到
matrix by another matrix I can do it a

647
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:05,744
列一次有四个
column at a time there there are four

648
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,054
这样就可以很好地增加矩阵
great ways to multiply matrices so this

649
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:12,135
另一个是一次一个一列，以便
is another one a column at a time so

650
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,064
这个左手边是SX1
this left hand side is SX 1

651
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:20,175
SX-我只是做每一栏和什么
SX - I just do each column and what

652
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,504
关于右手边我可以做到这一点
about the right hand side I can do that

653
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:28,004
乘法X1减去X2
multiplication X 1 minus X 2 did

654
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:32,864
有人说死不，我不想要哦
somebody say death no I don't want oh

655
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:36,975
借口编正确确定，当你说未来
excuse ed it right ok when you say next

656
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,405
1减X2我减去了你
1 minus X 2 I was subtracting but you

657
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,864
这意味着第一列是X.
meant that that's the first column is X

658
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,594
1和第二列是负X2
1 and the second column is minus X 2

659
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:51,554
纠正我们对此深感抱歉，做我们来
correct sorry about that and did we come

660
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:56,895
是的，因为现在我比较了SX1
out right yes because now I compare SX 1

661
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:02,594
是lambda1X1sX2是lambda2X2和
is lambda 1 X 1s X 2 is lambda 2 X 2 and

662
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:10,625
我是金色的，所以重点是什么
I'm golden so what was the point of this

663
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:16,935
我们学到了什么，我们学得很好
board what did we learn we learned well

664
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,895
我们有点期待原来的
we kind of expected that the original s

665
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,254
就像lambda一样
would be similar to the lambdas because

666
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:27,465
特征值匹配s具有本征
the eigen values match s has eigen

667
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,804
值lambda和这个对角矩阵
values lambda and this diagonal matrix

668
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:32,564
肯定有1和-1的特征值
certainly has eigen values 1 and minus 1

669
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,175
特征值的对角矩阵
a diagonal matrix the eigen values are

670
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,905
在你面前，所以他们是相似的
right in front of you so they're similar

671
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,844
s类似于lambda和那里
s is similar to the lambda and there

672
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:42,885
应该是M然后是某人
should be an M and then somebody

673
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,984
建议也许M是
suggested maybe the M is the

674
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:47,554
特征向量，这是正确的答案
eigenvectors and that's the right answer

675
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:52,395
所以最后让我写下来
so finally let me write that

676
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,775
在这里不仅仅是对称的
in here which isn't just for symmetric

677
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:04,785
所以也许我应该把它放在矩阵中
so maybe I should put it for matrix a so

678
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:11,705
如果它有lambdas和eigenvectors和
if it has lambdas and eigenvectors and

679
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:17,015
该要求是：时间是在
the claim is that a time's the

680
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:23,625
特征向量矩阵是特征向量
eigenvector matrix is the eigenvector

681
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:34,665
矩阵乘以特征值，我会
matrix times the eigenvalues and i would

682
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:41,745
缩短到ax等于xlambda和
shorten that to a x equals x lambda and

683
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,445
我可以重写那个然后我会慢下来
i could rewrite that and then i'll slow

684
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:57,425
向下作为相等的xlambdaX逆
down as a equal x lambda X inverse

685
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,715
真的，这是把它们整合在一起
really this is bringing it all together

686
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,315
这是一个简单的小公式
in a simple small formula it's telling

687
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,395
我们a类似于lambda它
us that a is similar to lambda it's

688
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,795
告诉我们做的矩阵M.
telling us the matrix M that does the

689
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,105
作为它的特征向量和矩阵
job it's the matrix of eigenvectors and

690
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:18,935
所以这就像写作的简写方式
so it's like a shorthand way to write

691
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,765
什么权利有关的主要事实
what right the main facts about

692
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,095
特征值和特征向量怎么样
eigenvalues and eigenvectors what about

693
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,945
我可以回到原点
a squared can I go back to the very

694
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,005
第一个IC时间接近这里结束
first IC time as close to the end here

695
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,245
什么是平方是什么
what about a squared what are the

696
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,185
什么是平方的特征向量
eigenvectors of a squared what are the

697
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,335
平方的特征值就像是
eigenvalues of a squared that's like the

698
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,095
特征值的整点或我
whole point of eigenvalues well or I

699
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,315
可以把那个愚蠢的东西放到X上
could just square that stupid thing X

700
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,355
lambdaX逆XlambdaX逆和
lambda X inverse X lambda X inverse and

701
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,775
我有什么X逆X在
what have I got X inverse X in the

702
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:00,285
中间是身份所以我有Xlambda
middle is identity so I have X lambda

703
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,365
平方X反向和我的那个
squared X inverse and to me that unto

704
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,755
你说的
you that says

705
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,915
项目值已经平方
the item values have been squared the

706
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,415
特征向量没有改变是的，没关系
eigenvectors didn't change yeah okay and

707
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,475
现在最后一口气是如果的话
now finally last breath is what if the

708
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,805
矩阵是对称的然后我们有
matrix is symmetric then we have

709
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,325
不同的字母，这是唯一的
different letters that's the only that's

710
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,925
特征向量的显着变化
a significant change the eigenvector

711
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:30,625
矩阵现在是一个正交矩阵我
matrix is now an orthogonal matrix I'm

712
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,265
回到关键的事实
coming back to the key facts of what

713
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,175
使对称如何阅读如何
makes symmetric how do I read how do I

714
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,845
看到对称帮助我的本征
see symmetric helping me in the eigen

715
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,515
矢量和特征值世界很好
vector and eigen value world well it

716
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,765
告诉我，特征向量
tells me that the eigenvectors are

717
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:51,205
正交所以X是Q的特征值
orthogonal so the X is Q the eigenvalues

718
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:55,015
是真实的，特征向量是x
are real and the eigenvectors is x

719
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,515
逆，但现在我要做那些
inverse but now I'm going to make those

720
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,135
特征向量和单位向量我要去
eigenvectors and unit vectors I'm going

721
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,135
为了规范它，所以我真的允许我
to normalize it so I'm really allowing I

722
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,315
有一个正交矩阵Q所以我有一个
have an orthogonal matrix Q so I have a

723
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,415
写这个的不同方式就是这样
different way to write this and this is

724
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,725
今天的课程Qlambda结束了
the end of the today's class Q lambda

725
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,055
什么是你能告诉我关于Q的事情
and what's what can you tell me about Q

726
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,475
逆它的Q转感谢使
inverse it's Q transpose thanks so that

727
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,505
这是现在的最后一次演讲
was the last lecture so now the

728
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,715
正交演讲将在即将到来
orthogonal lecture is coming up at the

729
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,445
对称矩阵的最后一秒
last second of the symmetric matrices

730
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:33,865
讲座，这个名字是谱
lecture and this has the name spectral

731
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:42,505
我刚刚放在那里和整个的定理
theorem which I just put there and whole

732
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:47,035
重点是，它告诉你每一个
point is that it tells you what every

733
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,050
symmetric matrix looks like orthogonal

734
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:55,850
对称矩阵看起来像正交

735
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,850
特征向量实特征值
eigenvectors real eigenvalues
