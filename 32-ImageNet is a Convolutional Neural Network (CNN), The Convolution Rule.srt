00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,614
我决定告诉你一件事
I'm determined to tell you something

10
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:28,905
关于我刚刚得到的卷积规则
about the convolution rule I just get

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,614
靠近它，但我还没有
close to it but I haven't quite got

12
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,525
在那里，实际上我想说
there and actually I'd like to say

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,435
东西也为什么卷积
something also about why convolution is

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,795
所以重要的这一点，我在这里提到过的
so important this I mentioned here a

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:48,965
关于深度学习中图像的论文
paper about images in deep learning by

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,885
它有三位作者，这两位是作者
it has three authors and these are two

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,805
他们也许你认识Hinton的
of them maybe you recognize Hinton's

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,315
说他原来是英国人
name he's originally English he was in

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,635
在圣地亚哥了好几年
in San Diego for quite a few years and

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,334
现在他在加拿大，所以多伦多和
now he's in Canada so Toronto and

21
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,705
蒙特利尔现在是很重要的中心
Montreal are big centers now for deep

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,435
学习儿子他是他真的其中之一
learning son he's he's really one of the

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,865
领导者之一，所以是队长
one of the leaders and and so is skipper

24
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,525
所以也许你知道，那种
so maybe you know that the sort of

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,515
深度学习的进步往往是
progress of deep learning can often be

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,825
在这些比赛所测量
measured in these competitions that are

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,395
你知道每年举办一次
held like about every year for you know

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,965
怎么做得有多好
how how well how well does something

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:40,935
人们设计并执行一个完整的神经
people design and execute a whole neural

30
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,794
网和这是一场比赛
net and this was a competition about

31
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,205
图像，以便真的苛刻
images so that is really demanding

32
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,355
因为正如我上次说的那样
because as I said last time an image has

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,945
如此多的样本像素那么多
so many samples so many pixels that the

34
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,195
计算问题是巨大的
computational problem is enormous and

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,215
那是你什么时候去的
that's when you would go to

36
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,075
卷积神经网络CNN因为a
convolutional neural nets CNN because a

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,094
卷积网占用较少的权重
convolutional net takes fewer weights

38
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,624
因为同样的重量正在出现
because the same weight is appearing

39
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,094
沿着对角线
along diagonals

40
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,535
它不需要
it doesn't need a

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,075
完整的权重矩阵只有一个顶行
full matrix of weights just one top row

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,395
权重反正所以这是一个
of weights anyway so this is one of the

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,645
历史文献中的
historical papers in the in the in the

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,555
深度学习的历史我会读
history of deep learning I'll just read

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,275
我们训练了几句这样的句子
a couple of sentences we trained so this

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,514
是我们训练深刻的抽象概念
is the abstract we trained a deep a

47
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,605
大型深度卷积神经网络
large deep convolutional neural network

48
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,564
但我只是说他们说了
but I'll just enter say that they took

49
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,064
它跑了五天两个GPU，因此
it ran for five days on two GPUs so it

50
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,234
我们会看到这是一个巨大的问题
was an enormous problem as we'll see so

51
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,044
我们训练了一个大型深编织网CNN
we trained a large deep knit network CNN

52
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,704
分类120万高分辨率图像
to classify 1.2 million high-res images

53
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,745
在图像网，所以图像网是一个来源
in image net so image net is a source of

54
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,975
数以百万计的图像和测试数据
millions of images and on the test data

55
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,354
他们我们最后的句子可能是一个
they well we the last sentences may be a

56
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,505
关键我们输入了这个模型的变体
key we entered a variant of this model

57
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,225
在2012年的比赛中
in the competition 2012 competition and

58
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,234
我们取得了前5名的测试错误
we achieved a winning top 5 test error

59
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,175
比率为15％，相比之下为26％
rate of 15% compared to 26% for for the

60
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,514
排名第二的球队，他们得到了15％的失误
second-place team so 15% error they got

61
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,865
其余26％是最好的
26% was the best that the rest of the

62
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,405
世界的确如此以及当他和他的时候
world did and so so that and and when he

63
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,865
显示网络，你意识到了什么
shows the network you realized what's

64
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:50,835
什么进入它它有卷积
what's gone into it it has convolution

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,124
图层和它有一些正常的图层和
layers and it has some normal layers and

66
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,685
它有最大的池层来切割
it has max pooling layers to cut the

67
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,944
尺寸向下一点点，它是和
dimension down a little bit and it's and

68
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:09,074
一半的样本放在一个GPU上
and half the samples go on one GPU and

69
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,574
另一半和某些点
half another and at certain points

70
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,285
两个GPU之间的层互连
layers interconnect between the two GPUs

71
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,154
所以减少过度拟合你
and so to reduce overfitting you

72
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,404
记住，关键问题是
remember that's the key problem is to

73
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,645
完全减少过度拟合
reduce overfitting in this in the fully

74
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,865
连接层那些是普通的
connected layers those are the ordinary

75
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,875
层与
layers with

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,165
我们使用的全重量矩阵
full weight matrices we employed a

77
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,165
最近开发的正规化称为
recently developed regularization called

78
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,435
辍学所以作为一种工具辍学如果
drop out so drop out as a tool which if

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,135
你觉得你在这个世界上
you're in this world you you I think

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,215
通过看到这一点，Hinton再次提出了这一点
Hinton proposed it again by seeing that

81
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,725
它的工作原理只是小心一点
it worked it's just a careful it's a

82
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,305
小心摒弃一些数据
careful drop out of of some of the data

83
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,175
它减少了数据量和它
it reduces the amount of data and it

84
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,665
这样做不会伤害问题
doesn't harm the the problem so so the

85
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,505
神经网络有6000万个参数
neural network has 60 million parameters

86
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,945
6000万神经元65万
60 million with 650 thousand neurons

87
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,615
五个卷积层和三个
five convolutional layers and three

88
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,695
我刚提到的完全连接的层
fully connected layers I just mentioned

89
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,385
这可以，如果你只是谷歌
this and you could if you just google

90
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,385
这两个名字你会在网上
these two names you would on the web

91
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,365
查看该文件提出将拿出
view that paper this paper would come up

92
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,435
但它就是这样我们正在谈论的
but it's so it's we're talking about the

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,585
真实的东西在这里卷积是一回事
real thing here convolution is something

94
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,315
每个人都想了解我，我会
everybody wants to understand and I I'd

95
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,595
自从我开始好几天以来
like to since I've started several days

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,655
以前，我想记住什么
ago and I'd like to remember what

97
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,335
卷积意味着如果我，就让我这样
convolution means let me so if I

98
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,075
卷入两个向量，我寻找
convolve two vectors and I look for the

99
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,485
案例组成部分答案了
case component of the answer the the

100
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,905
计算公式为我添加备份C的所有时间DS
formula is I add up all the C's times DS

101
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:10,535
其中i+J指标增加至k为什么
where the index i + j adds to k why do

102
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,555
你做了这样的事情
you do such a thing

103
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,685
因为c可能用a表示
because c might be represented by a

104
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,425
多项式说x++c+X到第n个
polynomial say x + + c + X to the nth

105
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,145
和D可能由另一个人代表
and D might be represented by another

106
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,455
一个D1X加MX到M让我们
one D 1 X plus the M X to the M let's

107
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,435
说
say

108
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,365
当我乘以时，就会产生卷积
and convolution arises when I multiply

109
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,715
那些多项式因为一个典型的
those polynomials because for a typical

110
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,885
然后收集条款，因为一个典型的
and then collect terms because a typical

111
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,035
X的力量对X说X
power of X say X to the K the

112
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,905
系数很好我们如何得到X.
coefficients are well how do we get X to

113
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,845
K乘以这些乘以C
the K in multiplying these I multiply C

114
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,205
在这里的某个地方没有时间DK
naught times a DK somewhere in here

115
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,355
对于K来说，这将是一个DKX，所以没有
would be a DK X to the K so a C naught

116
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,025
时间DK会给我一个X到K.
times a DK would give me an X to the K

117
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,015
每个人看到这个术语和c1次
term and a c1 times everybody sees this

118
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,605
现在来了，c1已经有了X
coming now c1 has an X in it already so

119
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,485
我们会在那里看DK减去1
over there we would look at DK minus 1

120
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,045
少了一个X所以它将是c1DK
with one less X so it would be c1 DK

121
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,595
减1，这只是你做了什么时
minus 1 this is just what you do when

122
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,315
你乘以多项式和点
you multiply polynomials and the point

123
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,675
是我们认识这些术语的方式
is that the way we recognize those terms

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,775
是指数0和K的指数
is that the exponents 0 and K the

125
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,615
指数1和K减1总是加
exponents 1 and K minus 1 always add to

126
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,925
K这就是这个公式的来源
K so that's where this formula comes

127
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,095
从我们采取C次D隐藏在后面
from we take a C times a D hiding behind

128
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,075
或者一个CX到I和一个DJX到J
or a C X to the I and a DJ X to the J

129
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,085
当加I加J为K时，这是X.
and when a plus I plus J is K this is X

130
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,445
对K而言，这就是我们的用语
to the K and that's the term we're

131
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,315
捕获所以这是系数
capturing so this is the coefficient of

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,265
那个词，让我写一个
that term and let me write it in a

133
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,845
你的方式略有不同
slightly different way where you

134
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,055
实际上看得更清楚了
actually see even more clearly

135
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,155
卷积运算所以J是K减去I
convolution operating so J is K minus I

136
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,695
对，所以它是CIDJ的总和但是
right so it's the sum of C I D J but the

137
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,284
j具有被K减去我所以这是
J has to be K minus I so this is the

138
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,964
这是记住公式的方法
this is the way to remember the formula

139
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,235
为
for the

140
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,455
内容中的系数CstarDin
coefficients in the content C star D in

141
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,905
你看看C的时间DS的卷积
the convolution you look at C's times DS

142
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,725
这是它的一种乘法形式
it's it's a form of multiplication it

143
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,084
来自普通乘法
comes from ordinary multiplication of

144
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,175
多项式以及收集术语时
polynomials and when you collect terms

145
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,834
你正在收集看IC和K.
you're collecting see the I C and the K

146
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,524
减去身份证，你可以尽一切可能
minus I D and you're taking all possible

147
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,135
眼睛所以它只是总结所有可能的
eyes so it's just sum over all possible

148
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,015
那里的眼睛给你的案例答案
eyes there to give you the case answer

149
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,655
好吧，看看你是否有这个想法
well just to see if you got the idea

150
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,245
什么是两个卷积
what would be the convolution of two

151
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,115
函数假设我有一个函数f
functions suppose I have a function f of

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,855
X和我想传达G的功能
X and I want to convey the function G of

153
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,834
X没关系，注意到我没有
X okay and notice that I have not

154
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,295
盘旋这个符号所以我没有做
circled this symbol so I'm not doing

155
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,665
周期性卷积我只是在做
periodic convolution I'm just doing

156
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,975
直截了当的卷积所以是什么
straightforward convolution so what are

157
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,865
我们将在两个案例的情况下
we going to have in the case of two

158
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,565
功能是什么意思
functions what would that mean a

159
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,595
函数的卷积我是我的
convolution of functions I'm I'm in

160
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,084
在这里平行，两个卷积
parallel here with a convolution of two

161
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,805
矢量这么认为的，这些现在有
vectors so think of these now have

162
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,715
成为案例组件的功能
become functions the case component has

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,385
真的，我应该在X上说F星G
become really I should say F star G at X

164
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,535
这真的是平行的
that's really that's really the parallel

165
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:18,305
对此，让我这样，我告诉你
to this so let me so I'm I'm telling you

166
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,265
我在X告诉你的答案
the answer at X here I told you the

167
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,274
在K案例中回答案例组成部分
answer at K case the case component

168
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,745
看起来像x值是什么
looks like that what does the x value of

169
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,465
卷积看起来像函数
the convolution look like for functions

170
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,105
好吧，我只是要这样做，我要去
okay I'm just going to do this I'm gonna

171
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,805
做同样的事情，而不是总结
do the same as this instead of summing

172
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:48,665
我将做什么整合而不是C
what will I do integrate instead of C

173
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,685
我将获得X的f
sub I I'll have f of X

174
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,825
眼睛指数我正在改变
eyes the index I is changing over to the

175
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,745
连续变量X和现在G代替
continuous variable X and now G instead

176
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,595
DK减去我这里有什么呢？
of DK minus I what do I have here so so

177
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,445
它是K减去I分量
it's uh it's K minus I component that

178
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,165
会去让我把它写下来ŧ
will go to let me just write it down t

179
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:26,045
减去X所以在这个翻译中F是
minus X so so in this translation F is

180
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,465
被翻译成C或对不起F是
being translated to C or sorry F is

181
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,165
对应CG对应DK
corresponds to C G corresponds to D K

182
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,645
对应X而且对不起我
corresponds to X and oh sorry I

183
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:48,535
对应于X和J，K对应于I.
corresponds to X and J and K minus I

184
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,375
对应于t减X所以K
corresponds to t minus X so so K

185
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,855
对应于T，这是什么
corresponds to T that's this is what

186
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,355
将是两个人的卷积
would be the convolution of two

187
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,625
功能哦它是T坏的功能
functions oh it's a function of T bad

188
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:12,155
T的坏符号就是这样
bad notation to the T is sort of this

189
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,285
转移量
the amount of shift

190
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,555
你看我已经转移了G我已经逆转了它
you see I've shifted G I've reversed it

191
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,215
并且翻转它和通过移位它
and flipped it and shifting it by

192
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,215
不同的金额这就是你的意思
different amounts T it's it's what you

193
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,395
在过滤器中它只是一直都是
have in a filter it's just all of always

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,465
因此在信号处理中存在
present in in in signal processing so

195
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,145
这将是一个定义，或者我可以
that would be a definition or I could if

196
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,815
你喜欢我，如果你想要一个X变量
you like I if you want an X variable to

197
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,545
出来让我做一个X变量来
come out let me make an X variable come

198
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,015
通过交换T和X这样就可以了
out by exchanging T and X so so this

199
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:53,045
将是X减去TDT我喜欢这样
would be X minus T DT I like that

200
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,145
实际上好一点，就是这样
actually a little better and it's the

201
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,565
积分超过t无穷大到
integral over t minus infinity to

202
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,315
无穷大，如果我们的功能在
infinity if our functions were on the

203
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,675
整条线将会有一个
whole line so that will there will be a

204
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,525
卷积规则
convolution rule for

205
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,155
这将连接到
the that this will connect to the

206
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,155
两个函数的傅里叶变换
Fourier transform of the two functions

207
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,755
在这里，我把它连接到
over here I'm connecting it to the

208
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,375
离散傅里叶变换的两个
discrete Fourier transform of the two

209
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,775
功能，我一直在做
functions and I've been making the

210
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,745
卷积循环所以我可以做什么
convolution cyclic so what does can I

211
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,845
现在添加循环这是普通的
add cyclic now this is ordinary

212
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,455
卷积这就是你所拥有的
convolution this is what you had in the

213
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,645
第一个实验，我认为从拉贾饶
first lab I think from from Raja Rao the

214
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,715
第一个实验中，你还记得你有图
first lab you remember you had to figure

215
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,505
了解了多少组件
out what the how many components the

216
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,355
卷积会有，你没有
convolution would have and you didn't

217
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,155
使它循环，所以循环卷积
make it cyclic so a cyclic convolution

218
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,575
如果这有n个组件而且这有
if if this has n components and this has

219
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,515
n个分量然后卷积有n
n components then the convolution has n

220
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,435
组件，因为你保持是和
components because you keeping yeah and

221
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,125
这是关键数字的长度
it's the key number there the length of

222
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,935
如果F，这个时期和此类似
the period and similarly over here if F

223
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,685
是2pi周期性的，G是2pi周期性的
is 2 pi periodic and G is 2 pi periodic

224
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,745
然后我们可能想要定期做
then we might want to do a periodic

225
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,185
卷积并带来它
convolution and bring it

226
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,135
得到一个也有2pi的答案
get a get an answer that also has 2 pi

227
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,735
期间2pi是的，所以你可以计算
of period 2 pi yeah so you could compute

228
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,755
正弦X与cosx的卷积
the convolution of sine X with cos x for

229
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,095
例
example

230
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,685
好吧，让我们坚持使用矢量，那么它是什么
ok let's stick with vectors so so what's

231
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,555
当我做的时候我让这笔交易
the deal when I make when I make it

232
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,035
当我使它循环然后进入时循环
cyclic when I make it cyclic then in

233
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,235
这个乘法
this multiplication

234
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,545
我真的应该使用我已经介绍过W作为
I really should use I've introduced W as

235
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:06,275
这不是环外X成为该
that instead of exocyclic X becomes this

236
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,605
这个数字W是2pi结束
this number W which is either 2 pi over

237
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,895
n并且具有属性然后W到
n and has the property then that W to

238
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,065
N是1所以所有的向量
the N is 1 so that all vectors of

239
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,095
大于n可以折叠使用
greater than n can be folded back using

240
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,905
这个规则是长度为n的向量所以我们
this rule to a vector of length n so we

241
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,285
得到一个循环工作，那怎么办
get a cyclic job so how does how does

242
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,085
这改变了我唯一想要的答案
that change the answer well I only want

243
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,735
ķ从0到n减1的
K going from 0 to n minus 1 in the

244
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,765
循环案例我不想要无限多
cyclic case I don't want infinitely many

245
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,275
组件我必须把它们带回来
components I've got to bring them back

246
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:55,265
再次，让我只说了这些规则
again and let me just say what the rule

247
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:03,545
你会问我说加J吧
would be you just ask say I plus J you

248
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,285
会看那个模数，那是什么
would look at that modulo n that's what

249
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,935
一个数论者会称之为我们
a number theory person would call it we

250
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,815
我们只看剩余的时间
only look at the remainder when we

251
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,705
用n所以我们所以现在的款项去鸿沟
divide by n so we so now the the sums go

252
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,275
只有从0到n减去1我才得到
only from 0 to n minus 1 and I only get

253
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,405
我从0到n减去1的答案
an answer from 0 to n minus 1 well I've

254
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,635
很快完成了
done that pretty quickly

255
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,415
如果我想这样做就好了
that's if I wanted to do justice to so

256
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,745
是非之间的区别
is the the difference between non

257
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,324
定期
periodic

258
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:54,225
所以非周期性和周期性的
so non-periodic and periodic will be the

259
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,065
之间的区别所以我有一些数字
difference between so I have some number

260
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,285
对角线t1t2t减零
T zero on the diagonals t 1 t 2 t minus

261
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,235
1t减2等等不断诊断
1 t minus 2 and so on constant diagnosis

262
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,324
关键名称有三胞胎和if
the key name there is triplets and if

263
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,905
这是周期性的，然后我会说CCC
it's periodic then I have I'll say C CC

264
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:23,115
然后下一个我们看到一个C一个
and then the next one we see one C one

265
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,775
来到C1和C2即将到来
coming around to C 1 and C 2 coming

266
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,325
所以它就像n期n那样
around so it's so as n by n period n so

267
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:40,815
这是一个循环矩阵nnok
it's a it's a circulant matrix n by n ok

268
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,065
这只是这是大局，我
that's just that's the big picture and I

269
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,705
想想你正在做的第一个实验室
think in that first lab you were doing

270
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,135
你的休息做非循环的情况
your rest to do the non circulant case

271
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,145
因为这是你必须在一个
because that's the one where you have to

272
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,245
做一点耐心会是什么
do a little patience what will be the

273
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,435
长度是什么长度
length yeah what would be the length of

274
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,615
非循环的
a non-circular

275
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,475
所以现在假设C假设没有循环
so not circulant now suppose C suppose

276
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,755
C矢量具有P分量和D
the C vector has P components and the D

277
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,025
矢量有Q组件有多少
vector has Q components how many

278
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,935
在那里卷积组件，所以我
components in there convolution so I

279
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,945
把那个问题写下来因为我
write that question down cuz I that

280
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,765
带来了差异在这里是的
brings out the difference here yeah so

281
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:30,135
所以如果我有P，如果C有C有P.
so if I have P if C has C has P

282
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,555
组件
components

283
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,775
他有线索组件则
he has cue components then the

284
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:46,375
C和D的卷积有多少
convolution of C and D has how many so

285
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,655
我正在成倍增长，所以这真的是这样
I'm multiplying so it's really this

286
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,285
对应于P次多项式
corresponds to a polynomial of degree P

287
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:59,665
减去1次P次的右多项式
minus 1 right polynomials of degree P

288
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,325
减1，这家伙将是Q学位
minus 1 and this guy would be degree Q

289
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,735
减1度Q减1和我
minus 1 degree Q minus 1 and what I

290
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,695
将它们与广告的程度相乘
multiply them what's the degree just ad

291
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,405
又有多少系数以及一个更
and how many coefficients well one more

292
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,345
我必须记住这个愚蠢的零
I have to remember for that stupid zero

293
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,515
订单期限，所以这将有P加Q
order term so this would have P plus Q

294
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,225
减去1个组件，这样就可以了
minus 1 component so that would have

295
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,055
是你不知何故必须的数字
been the number that you somehow had to

296
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,985
在第一个实验室中工作，以便如果
work out in in that first lab so that if

297
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,115
这有最终组件，这有n
this had end components and this had n

298
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,205
这将是n减1只是
this would have to n minus 1 it's just

299
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,355
你必须像你说3加
what you would have like you say 3 plus

300
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:54,325
在这种情况下，X乘1加2x，P是2Q.
X times 1 plus 2x in this case P is 2 Q

301
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,775
是22组件2组件，如果我
is 2 2 components 2 components and if I

302
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:04,045
乘以我得到的3X+6X是7x++
multiply those I get 3 X + 6 X is 7x + +

303
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:12,175
2x平方，所以我有2加2减
2 x squared and so I have 2 plus 2 minus

304
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:19,615
1等于3个分量X常数X和x
1 equals 3 components X constant X and x

305
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,955
平方是的，明确的仪式
squared yeah clear-rite

306
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,015
是的，这不是我的意思
yep so that's not the that's what I

307
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,525
如果我乘以这些矩阵就会得到
would get if I multiply these matrices

308
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,075
如果我有一个两个对角矩阵三胞胎
if I had a two diagonal matrix Triplets

309
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,715
矩阵乘以两条对角三胞胎
matrix times a two diagonal Triplets

310
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,875
矩阵，会给我一个三
matrix that would give me a three

311
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,755
对角线答案，但如果我这样做
diagonal answer but if I am doing it

312
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,225
定期我只需要
periodically I would only have to

313
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,345
如果那个2x平方将会回来
that that 2x squared would come back if

314
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,445
如果我回来2，所以我只有5
if I come back as a 2 so I just have 5

315
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,425
加上7x好的好的好的好
plus 7x good right good good good

316
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,875
好的，这是对什么的提醒
ok so that's a reminder of what

317
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,055
卷积是循环的非性类似的
convolution is cyclic a non-sex like

318
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,485
矢量和功能好吧，我可以
vectors and functions okay then I can

319
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,125
值和特征向量或下一个
values and eigen vectors or the next

320
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,765
步骤然后卷积规则是
step and then the convolution rule is

321
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,285
最后一步所以特征向量本征
the last step so eigen vectors eigen

322
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,535
当然我可以的圆圈矢量
vectors of the circle of course I can

323
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:33,985
只做方阵，所以我做
only do square matrices so I'm doing the

324
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,745
周期性情况所以特征向量是
periodic case so the eigen vectors are

325
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:44,485
特征向量的列
the columns of the of the eigenvector

326
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,995
矩阵，我会称之为
matrix and I'm gonna call it f for

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,765
傅立叶因此f是第一个特征向量
Fourier so f is the first eigen vector

328
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,065
是所有那些的X特征向量是
is all ones an X eigen vector is the

329
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,415
第四个根然后是平方根
fourth root of one then the square root

330
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:07,455
一个我6我吃了第四个我第六个
of one i 6 i ate i fourth i sixth and

331
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:15,705
最后一个我立刻我6i9好吧那是f
finally one i cubed i 6i9 okay that's f

332
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,185
那些的四个特征向量
those are the four eigen vectors of the

333
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:25,495
排列P和P中的任何多项式
permutation P and of any polynomial in P

334
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,785
所以我的循环是一些没有我的
so my circulant is is some C naught I

335
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:36,525
加上C1P加上C​​2P平方+c3pq
plus C 1 P plus C 2 P squared + c 3p q

336
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,695
好吧，最后这就像是一步
okay and finally this is like the step

337
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,485
我们已经准备好了，但没有
we've been almost ready to do but didn't

338
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,625
完全做什么是特征向量
quite do what are the eigen vectors what

339
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:53,805
呃它的特征向量是什么
uh what eigenvectors are its

340
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,965
特征向量
eigenvectors

341
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,734
那些是p和p的特征向量
so those are the eigenvectors of p and

342
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:06,414
现在我们只有豌豆的组合
now we have just a combination of peas

343
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,534
所以我认为我的特征向量
so I think the eigenvectors I just

344
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,855
乘我采取相同的组合
multiply I take that same combination of

345
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:23,794
特征向量是的，是的
the of the eigen vectors yep yep is that

346
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,725
看起来很对不起
that look right so sorry

347
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:36,185
我很抱歉它们的特征向量
it's I'm sorry its eigenvectors they're

348
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,504
F的列是我的意思
the columns of F the question I meant to

349
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:51,215
问是它的特征值是什么
ask is what are its eigenvalues that's

350
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,465
关键问题是什么
the key question what are the what are

351
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,924
特征值，我想如果我
the eigenvalues and I think that if I

352
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,744
只需乘以F倍CI即可
just multiply F times C I get the

353
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:04,205
矩阵C的特征值就是
eigenvalues of the matrix C that's the

354
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,604
美女，如果我的话，这是一个很好的公式
beauty that's the nice formula if my

355
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:13,054
矩阵只是P，然后这是01
matrix is just P alone then this is 0 1

356
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:18,575
00我得到1平方我立方但是
0 0 and I get 1 I I squared I cubed but

357
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,034
如果C是其他的一些组合
if C is some other combination of the

358
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,914
豌豆和我采取相同的组合
peas and I take the same combination of

359
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:31,975
要看的本征向量是的
the eigen vectors to to see yeah

360
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,004
你看到了吗，所以我声称我会
do you see it so I'm claiming that I'll

361
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:41,965
从中得到C的本征值
get for eigen values of C from this

362
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:47,044
当然，如果C知道是否
multiplication so of course if C know if

363
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:51,544
那里只有C然后我才得到C.
there's only C not then I only get C

364
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,154
没有CnaughtCnaughtC没有我得到
naught C naught C naught C naught I get

365
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,514
这是重复四次但是如果
it's a repeat four times repeated but if

366
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,154
如果它是这个组合那么它就是一个
it's a if it's this combination then

367
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,004
矩阵乘法需要
that matrix multiplication takes the

368
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,394
同样的组合是一个
same combination of this is a

369
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:08,895
的组合
combination of

370
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,475
特征向量和那给了我们
the eigenvectors and and that gives us

371
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,585
给它给我们正确的事情好吧
give it gives us the right thing okay so

372
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,495
这就是现在我只是有一个步骤
that's now I just have one more step for

373
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,075
这是卷积规则然后我
this the convolution rule and then I'm

374
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:40,414
真的很高兴卷积规则是
happy really the convolution rule is

375
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:47,174
说明我们在说什么关系
stating what we it's stating a relation

376
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,515
在我们看到的乘法之间
between multiplication which we saw here

377
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,105
和我们解决卷积
and the convolution which we solve for

378
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,255
系数因此是卷积规则
the coefficients so the convolution rule

379
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,105
是乘法和。之间的联系
is a connection between multiplying and

380
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,005
卷积所以让我说什么
convolution and so let me say what that

381
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,774
卷积规则是让我写的
convolution rule is and let me write it

382
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:18,585
正确如此，所以我采取循环
correctly so so here I take cyclic

383
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,095
卷积我正在处理广场
convolution I'm dealing with square

384
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,635
矩阵一切都是循环这里
matrices everything is cyclic here and

385
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,075
如果我乘以F，我会得到什么呢？
then I get if I multiply by F what do I

386
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,325
现在有
have now

387
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,044
这代表了什么是C和
what does that represent this was C and

388
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:40,605
B和艾克参与其中，所以我得到了另一个
B and Ike involved them so I got another

389
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,024
循环矩阵所以在这里如此
circulant matrix so so so up here the

390
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,774
矩阵的乘法是C次
multiplication of of matrices is C times

391
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:53,024
D我想连接那些乘法
D I want to connect multiplying those

392
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:58,575
汇总了我想要的C语言
matrices with convolving the C's I want

393
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,284
连接使这种连接正确
to connect make that connection right so

394
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,845
这种联系就是卷积
and that connection is the convolution

395
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,135
规则好，所以这将是
rule okay so this would be the

396
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:18,335
CD的特征值
eigenvalues of CD

397
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,495
让我们暂停，为什么我为什么
let's just pause there why why am I

398
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,164
看着CD的特征值因为
looking at the eigenvalues of CD because

399
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:27,105
如果我做那个乘法我得到
if I do that multiplication I get

400
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,515
另一个无尖点矩阵C乘以D和
another tipless matrix C times D and the

401
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,745
花粉只有它们的系数
pollen only their coefficients

402
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,015
与C乘以D的对角线相关联
associated on the diagonals of C times D

403
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,125
是卷积的系数
are the coefficients of the convolution

404
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:51,135
所以对角线的对角线来了
so the its diagonals its diagonals come

405
00:27:51,140 --> 00:28:03,164
从D卷入C6-好吧，现在我
from convolving C with D 6 - okay now I

406
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:06,164
想在a中找到那些相同的特征值
want to find those same eigenvalues in a

407
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:08,894
第二种方式和匹配方程式
second way and match and the equation

408
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:11,835
将是如何卷积规则
will be the convolution rule so how

409
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,865
我能否很好地找到CD的特征值
could I find the eigenvalues of C D well

410
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:23,465
令人惊讶的是，它们是C的特征值
amazingly they are the eigenvalues of C

411
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:34,544
D倍的特征值
times the eigenvalues of D I'm gonna

412
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,725
你可以在2比2的基础上测试这条规则
test this rule on two-by-two so you'll

413
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,154
看到一切都在发生，但事实如此
see everything happening but so this is

414
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,985
这是我想要的事实
the main this is the fact that I want to

415
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:48,664
使用因为是因为C和D通勤
use because yeah because C and D commute

416
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:51,615
C和D通勤它们具有相同的特征
C and D commute they have the same eigen

417
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,005
矢量，然后是特征值
vectors and then the eigen values just

418
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,205
乘以我可以乘以我可以得到
multiply so I can multiply I can get

419
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,414
以第二种方式取本征
that in a second way by taking the eigen

420
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,255
C的值并乘以
values of C and multiplying those by the

421
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,975
D和I的本征值相乘
eigen values of D and I multiply

422
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,325
按组件分组我乘以
component by component I multiply the

423
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,475
对于本征值的浑身
eigen value for the for the all one's

424
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,965
矢量由所有的特征值
vector by the eigen value for the all

425
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,265
一个矢量，所以我做一做，你知道这
one's vector so I do a do you know this

426
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,975
MATLAB命令逐个组件
MATLAB command component by component

427
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,015
乘法这是一个重要的
multiplication this is it's an important

428
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,295
一个人的名字也是
one there's a guy's name is also

429
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,685
与之相关联，所以这是一个
associated with that so so that's a

430
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,175
矢量，这是一个矢量，什么来了
vector that's a vector and what comes

431
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,775
如果我有一个向量，那就完成了那个操作
out of that operation if I have a vector

432
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,805
有三个组件所以n在这里是三个
with three components so n is three here

433
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,815
我确实指出明星或点星我不是
and I do point star or dot star I'm not

434
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,115
确定人们通常所说的组件
sure what people usually say component

435
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,095
通过组件三组分向量
by component a three component vector

436
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,285
我得到一个三分量矢量的时间
times a three component vector I get a

437
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,625
三个分量矢量就这样
three component vector just like that

438
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,115
是的，所以这就是卷积
yeah yeah so this is the convolution

439
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,285
规则是卷积和
rule that's the convolution and the

440
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,425
证明就是当特征时的事实
proof is the fact that eigen that when

441
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,595
矩阵通勤的本征值
matrices commute the eigen values of the

442
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,115
产品或只是这些特征值时间
product or just these eigen values times

443
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,305
这些特征值因为它们具有
these eigen values because they have the

444
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,885
同样的本征特征向量总是如此
same eigen the eigen vectors are always

445
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,725
对于所有这些循环都是如此
the same here for all these circulant so

446
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,305
我可以使用卷积规则
there's the convolution rule that I can

447
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:41,025
传达然后变换或我可以变换
convey then transform or I can transform

448
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:46,485
分开然后再乘以
separately and then multiply so just

449
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,805
或许更好地写出卷积
maybe better write that the convolution

450
00:30:49,810 --> 00:31:01,475
我们称之为C规则卷积
let's call it the C rule convolve then

451
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:21,545
由F变换或单独变换
transform by F or transform separately

452
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:36,785
用F然后再乘以点
by F and then then multiply point wise

453
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,645
你知道元素是啊
you know element by element yeah

454
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:47,805
一些奖金好耶这样组件
component by some bonus okay yeah so

455
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,395
这是卷积规则，为什么是
that's the convolution rule and why is

456
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,235
它有点为什么如此重要
it sort of why is it so important

457
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,615
因为F乘以变换
because transforming by F multiplying by

458
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,585
傅里叶矩阵非常快
the Fourier matrix is extremely fast by

459
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:13,935
在FFT所以所以它是有用的，因为的
the FFT so so it's useful because of the

460
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,875
FFT快速傅立叶变换到
FFT the fast Fourier transform to

461
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:31,985
乘以yep或转换为哪一个
multiply yep or to transform whichever

462
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:42,465
乘以F变换
multiplied by F transform

463
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,435
所以它就是存在的存在
so it's it's the it's the exist presence

464
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,764
使它成为现实的FFT给了我们一个
of the FFT that makes this it gives us a

465
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,685
真的两种不同的方式来做到这一点
really two different ways to do it

466
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:57,174
其实这是更快的方式，所以我们
in fact which is the faster way so we

467
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:05,154
可以通过这种方式产生相同的结果
can produce the same result this way or

468
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:11,994
这样，如果我不计算成本
this way and if I don't count the cost

469
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,264
如果乘以F的成本是
of if the cost of multiplying by F is

470
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:18,715
低，因为我有FFT
low because I have the FFT which would

471
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,544
你做
you do

472
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:23,424
你会这样做让我放手吧
which would you do so let's let me just

473
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:25,315
在我们回答之前大声思考
think aloud before we answer that

474
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,705
问题，然后我们是好的，如果
question and then we're we're good so if

475
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,854
我所以我的向量有n个组件，所以一个
I so my vectors have n components so one

476
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:37,374
我能做的就是如何做卷积
way I can do is to do convolution how

477
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:41,484
如果我拿走一个，有多少步骤
many how many steps is that if I take a

478
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,705
矢量与n个组件，我卷积
vector with n components and I convolve

479
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,134
用n个组件的向量有多少
with a vector with n components how many

480
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:48,294
我必须做很少的乘法
little multiplications do I have to do

481
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:53,335
因为每个C都是正确的
and square right because each of the C's

482
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,154
必须将每个DS乘以这样
has to multiply each of the DS so that

483
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,215
拿N平方和傅立叶很便宜
takes N squared and Fourier is cheap

484
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:11,424
它的N日志N日志基数为二，因此
it's n log n log to base 2 so the

485
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,324
左手边实际上是立方体
left-hand side is effectively in cubed

486
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,455
这个如何
what about this one

487
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,495
这两个人做多少了多少
how many up how many to do these two

488
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:29,604
男人找傅立叶变换
guys to find the Fourier transform to

489
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,054
乘以矩阵Fok即可
multiply by the matrix F ok those are

490
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:35,094
再快，这只是我有两个
fast again that's just I've got two

491
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,495
乘以F得到2nlogN.
multiplications by F so that's 2 n log N

492
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,365
什么是这样做的成本
and what's the cost of this

493
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:51,065
我有一个带有n个成分点的矢量
I have a vector with n components dot

494
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,135
明星矢量另一种向量与n
star vector another vector with n

495
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,515
组件有多少
components how many little

496
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,785
我必须做的乘法
multiplications do I have to do for a

497
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,515
Hadamard产品或一个或一个组件
Hadamard product or a or a component by

498
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,525
组件产品n只在+中是的我
component product n only in + in yeah I

499
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,955
也许我应该做那个+
should maybe I should have made that +

500
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,615
是啊是啊我有我只好我知道我有
yeah yeah I had I had to I know I had

501
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,725
一个nlogn加上它取M平方
one n log n plus it took M squared to

502
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,425
找到那个向量，然后nlogn
find that vector and then n log n so

503
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,515
它的有效ñ平方但这一次
it's effectively N squared but this one

504
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,085
我在那里做Nlogn两次然后我
where I do the N log n twice and then I

505
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,745
只有它才会让我更多，所以这是
only it only takes me in more so this is

506
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:41,915
快速的方式，如果你想
the fast way so if you wanted to

507
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,265
乘以两个非常大的长整数
multiply two really big long integers as

508
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,315
你想要在密码学中做什么
you would want to do in in cryptography

509
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,805
如果你有两个长整数说
if you had two long integers say of

510
00:35:52,810 --> 00:36:01,025
长度125126128128组件
length 125 126 128 128 components to

511
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,975
乘那些你会过得更好
multiply those you would be better off

512
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,525
分别进行循环变换
to separately take the cyclic transform

513
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,935
这些百人中的每一个
of each of those hundred and

514
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:15,715
二十八个家伙，这样做
twenty-eight guys and do it this way

515
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,805
拿这个转变来做
take this take the transforms do the

516
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,495
逐个组件产品然后
component by component product and then

517
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,645
变换回拿到呀没错如此
transform back to get that yeah yep so

518
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,515
这是卷积规则的原因
it's the convolution rule is what makes

519
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,215
那个没关系，所以哦，还有一个
that go okay so that's oh one more

520
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,285
以为我想这一切
thought I guess about all this

521
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:43,235
卷积的东西假设我们在2d我们
convolution stuff suppose we're in 2d we

522
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,385
不得不考虑什么是什么
have to think what's what is a

523
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,305
二维卷积是什么
two-dimensional convolution what does

524
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,965
这成了
this become

525
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,084
在两个方面假设我们有
in two dimensions suppose we have

526
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:57,854
功能所以现在我将成为
functions so now I'm to be functions of

527
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:04,145
x和y周期性或非周期性但是
x and y periodic or not periodic but

528
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,245
什么是卷积是什么？
what will we what's a convolution what's

529
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,975
我们要做的操作有两个
the operation we have to do in two

530
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,985
尺寸很好，它是一个双重积分
dimensions well it's a double integral

531
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:20,675
当然T和你我们会做T和T.
of course T and u we would do F of T and

532
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:33,155
u乘以X的G减去TDu和
u times G of X minus t y- u d TD u and

533
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,824
这将产生一个功能，所以我
that would produce a function so i'm

534
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:41,055
将x和y的函数与...进行卷积
convolving a function of x and y with

535
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,084
X的另一个功能，我也是
another function of X and again I'm

536
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:47,715
寻找这这这是
looking for the this this this is the

537
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,875
关键看为x轴牛逼Y-ü认为这是
key to watch for x- t y- u that that's

538
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,104
卷积积分的信号
the signal of a convolution integral

539
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,175
是的，这就是我们所拥有的
yeah so that that's what we would have

540
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,995
在2d的将军中，你可能会这么多
in 2d in generals do you so much may be

541
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,405
我现在最后的想法是搬到
mine now my final thought is to move to

542
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,945
考虑二维矩阵和
think about two dimensional matrices and

543
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,735
及其产品等，这是
and their products and so on and this is

544
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,645
为什么你需要它们，因为你就是这样
why you need them because you're you if

545
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,175
如果你有二维，那就是你
you're if you have two dimensional

546
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,405
信号然后组件适合a
signals then the components fit into a

547
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,505
矩阵，我们只需要操作
matrix and we just have to operate in

548
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:39,275
这两个方面都是如此关键
both dimensions so so the the key

549
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:48,725
他们在2d的关键操作是在MATLAB中
their key operation in 2d is in MATLAB

550
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:54,495
您需要知道的MATLAB命令
the MATLAB command that you need to know

551
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,135
如果你知道你在做什么，就得到
to get if you know what you're doing in

552
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,445
1d你想在2d做到
1d and you want to do it in 2d the

553
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:05,355
MATLAB命令是cron所以我们想象
MATLAB command is cron so so we imagine

554
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,775
我们有一维矩阵a和B.
we have one dimensional matrices a and B

555
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,405
所以那些是1d而我们想要的
and so those are in 1d and we want to

556
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:19,055
为他们生产自然
produce the natural to them

557
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,135
二维矩阵所以这些将是
two-dimensional matrix so these will be

558
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:28,995
由M和我们想要那种自然
n by M and we want the sort of natural

559
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,835
产品让我称之为k为cron
product let me call it k for cron which

560
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,055
我想要的N平方N平方
will be N squared by N squared I want to

561
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:46,635
创建一个连接到的二维矩阵
create a 2d matrix with connected to an

562
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,995
图像这n个所以每个方向
image that's n in each direction so it

563
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,565
有它有N个平方像素，这是
has it has N squared pixels this is

564
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,695
这些是1d信号，K是2d信号
these are 1d signals and K is a 2d one

565
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,425
而这个洞穴就在那里
and this cave would be there this is the

566
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:09,795
知道给予的操作
operation to know given given to one

567
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,835
维数n乘n矩阵cron
dimensional N by n matrices cron

568
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,925
产生一个N平方N平方
produces a to an N squared by N squared

569
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,675
矩阵
matrix

570
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,675
它病了，这是一个了解的操作
it's sick it's a operation to know so

571
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,405
如果你知道什么，我会把它写进来
I'll just write it in if you know what

572
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,865
cron是，你知道你知道什么
cron is and you know what you know it

573
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,135
在我写之前，我想要的是什么
before I write it so what so I want to

574
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,405
产生一个由N组成的矩阵
produce a big matrix n squared by N

575
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,695
平方
squared

576
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,855
以某种方式适当地增加这些
somehow appropriately multiplying these

577
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,515
两个家伙和适当的方式做
two guys and the appropriate way to do

578
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:50,095
取一个1并乘以B
it is to take a 1 1 and multiplied by B

579
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,825
所以有什么我有什么大小有我
so there what do I have what size have I

580
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,805
得到他们已经只是在那一个
got they're already just in that one

581
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,485
角落n由右边它是多次
corner n by n right it's a number times

582
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:05,075
N乘n矩阵然后是1/2的B
an N by n matrix then a 1/2 times B

583
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,075
这是另一个n乘n矩阵，最高可达1n
that's another n by n matrix up to a 1 n

584
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:18,125
倍B所以我现在抱歉Kappa所以我
times B so I have now sorry Kappa so I

585
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:23,105
每个都有一个插入式矩阵
have tap-in matrices in a row each of

586
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:26,045
那些矩阵是n，所以我的那一行
those matrices is n by n so my that row

587
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,925
长度N平方，当然是
has length N squared and of course the

588
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:38,975
下一行是我已经允许自己
next row is I've I've allowed myself to

589
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,325
数字从1到N但很常见
number from 1 to N but very often that

590
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,025
编号应为0到n减1和
numbering should be 0 to n minus 1 and

591
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,625
最后在这里下降到1和1
finally going down here down to a and 1

592
00:41:49,630 --> 00:42:00,875
B所以N是N的平方
B so so that's the N squared by N

593
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,555
平方矩阵，你需要
squared matrix that you would need to

594
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,895
知道例如，如果你想要做一个
know for example if you wanted to do a

595
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,415
你转变的二维转移
two dimensional transfer you transform

596
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:16,295
它会是的，所以两个会是什么
it would be yeah so what would a two

597
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,775
每个维度傅里叶变换
dimensional Fourier transform per do

598
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,385
这个矩阵是什么矩阵你
what what matrix is this the matrix you

599
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:30,965
会用一个2D我没有那种
would use for for a 2d I haven't sort of

600
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,485
在2d傅立叶上正确开始
got started properly on 2d Fourier

601
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:38,425
变换所以它会是F次FF
transform so would it be F times F F

602
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,855
请让我写下来
cronic so let me write down the full

603
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,615
这个家伙chroniker的名字是这样的
name of this guy chroniker so it's

604
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:50,575
它就是Kronecker产品
called the Kronecker product it's just

605
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,605
知道这是正确的事情
it's just the right thing to know in

606
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,765
从一个维度移动到两个维度
moving from one dimension to two

607
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:02,415
尺寸例如让我
dimensions for example let me

608
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:17,985
我有一块板，是的，是的，所以在这里
I got one board left yeah yeah so here's

609
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:23,084
标准矩阵称它为二和
a standard matrix call it a twos and

610
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:27,705
减去这就是那个合唱
minus ones so that that's that chorus

611
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,995
这对应于二阶导数
that corresponds to a second derivative

612
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,245
或实际减去二阶导数
or actually minus the second derivative

613
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,364
现在假设我有另一个配偶
now suppose I have a mate another the

614
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:43,125
对应于第二个的相同矩阵
same matrix corresponding to second

615
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:50,415
衍生物在Y方向上相同而且
derivatives in the Y direction same and

616
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,564
我真正想要做的就是我想要的
what I really want to do is both I want

617
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:59,135
有一个对应的矩阵K.
to have a matrix K that corresponds to

618
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,584
减去X方向的第二个
minus the second in the X Direction

619
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:07,785
减去第二个和Y所以这是
minus the second and the Y so this is

620
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:15,854
拉普拉斯拉普拉西亚到处都是
the Laplace laplacian which is all over

621
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:19,275
a中微分方程的位置
the place in differential equations at a

622
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,505
我想做的典型点-其中之一
typical point I want to do - one of

623
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,324
这两个-其中一个
these two of these - one of those in the

624
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,205
X方向，我想补充一点
X direction and I want to add to that

625
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,875
减去一个现在也变成了四个
minus one now that too becomes a four

626
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,785
在Y方向减去一个，所以我
and minus one in the Y direction so I'm

627
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,814
寻找两个伙伴的两个人
looking for the two by two mate

628
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:41,535
二维矩阵
the the two dimensional matrix that

629
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,285
采取那种五点计划
takes that does that five-point scheme

630
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,114
每个点的五个权重需要四个
five weights for each point takes four

631
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,074
在对角线和减去一个上
of the on the diagonal and minus one on

632
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,155
四个邻居和操作
the four neighbors and the operation

633
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,364
这样做会是你会的
that would do that would be you would

634
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:05,715
使用cron它不会是B的cron
use cron it wouldn't be cron of a B that

635
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,915
只是B的B不是我的意思
would just K of a B is not what I what I

636
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,465
是B的cron不是我想要的
was a cron of a B is not what I want

637
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,725
是的，那会做一个，然后是
yeah that would do one and then the

638
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,555
另一个然后那可能
other one and then that would probably

639
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,535
产生九个非零我想要的东西
produce nine non-zeros I want something

640
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,905
在这里添加所以我想要一个cron
that adds here so I I want cron of a

641
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,995
时间是给我的身份
time's the identity that gives me the

642
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,445
这部分的二维事物
the two dimensional thing for this part

643
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:46,625
然后我会加上我的cron
and then I'll add on cron of I be for

644
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:51,005
衍生物的垂直导数
the vertical derivative the derivatives

645
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,485
在Y方向，所以就是这样
in the Y direction so that would be so

646
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,745
这被称为chroniker，这是一个
that's called a chroniker some this is a

647
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,755
这是一个另一个是chroniker
this is a the other was a chroniker

648
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,785
产品，这将是一个慢性病
product so that would be a chronica

649
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,735
产品这将是另一个Kronecker
product this would be another Kronecker

650
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,015
产品和总称为
product and that total is called the

651
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:14,975
chroniker好吧我想要得到
chroniker some okay I wanted just to get

652
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,305
这些符号是因为真的
that those notations out because really

653
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,665
你知道傅立叶改造我说的是
you know Fourier transforming I said is

654
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:26,074
所有这样的中央运作
such a central operation in in in all of

655
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,045
应用混乱，尤其是信号
Applied mess and especially in signal

656
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,425
处理好，所以今天我很好
processing okay so I'm good for today

657
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,255
让我们看看到目前为止我有一名志愿者
let's see I've got one volunteer so far

658
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,485
我可以谈谈一个项目
for to talk about a project can I

659
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,145
鼓励任何人发送电子邮件
encourage an email from anybody it

660
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,445
难道你不必成为超级巨星
doesn't you don't have to be a superstar

661
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:52,475
它只是愿意这样做告诉我们
it's just willing to to do it tell us

662
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,185
关于你学到的东西得到的东西
something about what you've learned get

663
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,035
从观众的评论，你知道
comments from the audience and you know

664
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,844
我十分十五分钟
ten ten or fifteen minutes is all I'm

665
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:04,354
想着它，好吧，我会告诉你的
thinking about it yeah okay I'll let you

666

如果你愿意的话，给我发一封电子邮件
send me an email if you're if you'd like

667
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,755
告诉我们，并得到一些反馈确定
to tell us that and get some feedback ok

668
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,160
好，所以我星期三见

669
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,779
good so I'll see you Wednesday
