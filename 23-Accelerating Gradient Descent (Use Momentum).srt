00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,464
谈论梯度下降和和
talk about gradient descent and the and

10
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:35,775
它的后代也是基本的
its descendants so from the basic

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,695
我们所有的梯度下降公式
gradient descent formula which we all

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,015
知道让我写下来的新
know let me just write that down the new

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,535
要点是我们要走的旧点
point is the old point we're going

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,995
向下，所以用减号表示
downwards so with a minus sign that's

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,465
步长我们计算
the step size and we compute the

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,115
在XK的梯度，所以我们正在下降
gradient at X K so we're descending in

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,574
负梯度的方向
the direction of the negative gradient

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:07,125
这是基本的公式，并在
and that's the basic formula and is in

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:13,395
每本书都是我研究的主要参考书
every book studied so my main reference

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,485
对于这些讲座中的一些是
for the some of these lectures is the

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,904
斯蒂芬博伊德和林登的书
book by Stephen Boyd and Linden and

22
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,805
范登堡和我再次提到
Vandenberg and and I mentioned again

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,675
博伊德教授在这个房间里说话
professor Boyd is talking in this room

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,875
下周三周三和周四
next week Wednesday Thursday and and

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,885
他周五在某个地方说话
he's speaking somewhere on Friday at

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,935
4:30当然还有优化
4:30 and of course about optimization

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,904
他是个好讲师，非常好
and he's a good lecturer yeah very good

28
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,934
好的，所以有最陡的下降和
okay so there's steepest descent and

29
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,595
我上次重绘了我的照片
I've redrawn my picture from last time

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,995
我会去那边看看那个
that I'll go over there and look at that

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,505
图片，但让我说出来的是什么
picture but let me say what's coming so

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,345
这是非常标准非常标准的你
that's pretty standard very standard you

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,575
可以说这是改善
could say then this is the improvement

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,874
被广泛使用添加的东西
that is widely used adding in something

35
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,695
称为动量以避免之字形
called momentum to avoid the zigzag that

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,124
我们要去看看
we're going to see

37
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,654
还有另一种方法可以做到这一点
and there's another way to do it there's

38
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,745
一个名叫内斯特的俄罗斯人
a Russian guy named Nestor off his

39
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,844
论文不容易阅读，但他们已经
papers are not easy to read but they've

40
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,835
得到了严肃的内容，他做了一件事
got serious content and one thing he did

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,335
被找到的势头替代方案，
was find an alternative to momentum that

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,484
也加速了下降所以这
also accelerated the the descent so this

43
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,645
产生这两者产生更快
produces these both produce faster

44
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,154
血统比普通的一个好和
descent than the ordinary one okay and

45
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,665
然后你知道展望未来
then you know looking ahead that for

46
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,904
机器学习的问题就是这样
problems of machine learning they're so

47
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,044
大的梯度，我们有这么
large that the gradient and we have so

48
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,884
许多变量都是那些权重
many variables all those weights are

49
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,975
变量全部和那可能数百个
variables all and that could hundreds of

50
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,035
成千上万并不罕见
thousands is is not uncommon

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,675
这样梯度就变成了
so that then the gradient becomes a

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,814
相当大的计算，我们没有
pretty big calculation and we don't have

53
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,615
做这一切的，一旦我们不必
to do it all at once we don't have to

54
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,484
改变所以xk是所有的向量
change so xk is a vector of all the

55
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,285
权重或使用和我们的方程
weights or and using and our equations

56
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,745
是匹配训练数据
are the matching the the training data

57
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,275
所以我们不必使用所有的培训
so we don't have to use all the training

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,634
数据一下子我们不接受
data at once and we don't we take a

59
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,074
一批训练数据，但一个
batch of training data like one but

60
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,145
这种方式效率低下
that's sort of inefficient in the

61
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,185
相反的方向，他们做一个在一个
opposite direction they do them one at a

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,194
时间，所以我们不想与他们做
time so we don't want to do with them

63
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,965
一次一个，但我们不想这样做
one at a time but we don't want to do

64
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,185
一次只有百万
all all million at a time

65
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,654
因此妥协是一个小批量
so the compromise is a mini batch so

66
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:56,895
讽刺的渐变血统做迷你
sarcastic gradient descent does a mini

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,564
批量一次一个小批次的
batch at a time a mini batch of of

68
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:08,115
每个样本培训数据的培训
training of samples training data each

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,104
步骤，它可以选择它们
step and it can choose them

70
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,954
随机地或随机地意义
stochastically meaning randomly or

71
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,455
坐得更系统，但我们做了一个
sitting more systematically but we do a

72
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,214
一批在时间和会后
batch at a time and that will come after

73
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,785
该
the

74
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,715
它将在下周马拉松比赛后出现
it'll come next week after a marathon of

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,095
当然星期一好吧让我走吧
course on Monday okay so let me just go

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,955
回到那张照片片刻，但是
back to that picture for a moment but

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,035
那么今天真正的内容就是这个
then the real content of today is this

78
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,285
一个动量增加好吧，我只是我
one with momentum added okay I just I

79
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,725
可能没有完美的画面
probably haven't got the picture perfect

80
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:55,135
但我认为我不是艺术家
yet I'm just not an artist but I think

81
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,665
我离我很近，所以这就是那些
I'm closer so this is uh those are the

82
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,235
级别设置那些是X的集合f
level sets those are the sets f of X

83
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,245
等于常数和我们的模型问题
equal constant and in our model problem

84
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,355
X的f是X1平方或者说x
f of X is X 1 squared or let's say x

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,805
平方加上By平方等于常数
squared plus B y squared equal constants

86
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,875
小B低于1，可能远
with small B be below 1 and maybe far

87
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,575
低于1所以那些是椭圆形的那些
below 1 so those are ellipses those the

88
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,315
椭圆的方程式，这就是什么
equations of an ellipse and that's what

89
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,465
我试图绘制，如果B小则那么
I tried to draw and if B is small then

90
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,985
椭圆形长而薄
the ellipses are long and thin like that

91
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,575
现在你的照片是什么样的
and now what's what's the picture you

92
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,405
从一点开始，没有你和你
start with a point X naught and you

93
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,665
以最陡的方向下降所以
descend in the steepest direction so the

94
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,525
最陡的方向垂直于
steepest direction is perpendicular to

95
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,285
水平设置正确垂直于
the level set right perpendicular to the

96
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,355
椭圆让你倒下来
ellipse so you down down down you're

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,305
更多地通过更多的椭圆
passing through more ellipses more

98
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,325
省略号更多省略号最终你的
ellipses more ellipses eventually your

99
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,205
切线在我看来，它必须是
tangent to it seems to me it has to be

100
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,235
切线我没看过这个，但它看起来
tangent I didn't read this but it looks

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,415
对我来说合理的是最远的
reasonable to me that the the farthest

102
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,905
在水平设置最远的椭圆形你是
in level-set farthest an ellipse you're

103
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,005
相切，然后你开始上升
tangent to and then you start going up

104
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,795
再次，这是最佳点
again so that's the optimal point to

105
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,915
停止结束那一步，然后在哪里
stop to end that step and then where

106
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,885
下一步是否顺利，你就在这里
does the next step go well you're here

107
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,005
你在一个水平集的椭圆上
you're on an ellipse that's a level set

108
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,285
你想要在渐变中移动
you want to move in the gradient

109
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,325
与...垂直的方向
direction that's perpendicular to the

110
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,385
水平设置，所以你要去某个地方
level set so you're going down somewhere

111
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,655
在这里，你又过去了
here and you're passing again through

112
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,295
越来越多的椭圆直到你的
more and more ellipses until your

113
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,305
与...相切
tangent to a

114
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,675
在这里和你一个较小的椭圆
to a smaller ellipse here and and you

115
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,065
看到之字形图案和锯齿形
see the zig-zag pattern and that zig-zag

116
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:55,805
模式是我们通过公式看到的
pattern is what we see by formula in in

117
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,475
博伊德的书和许多其他地方也是如此
Boyd's book and many other places too

118
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,525
公式有权力
the formula has the there was powers of

119
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,664
一个神奇数字的光束，所以我们开始
a beam of the magic number so we start

120
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:19,875
在点b1开始并按照这个
at start at the point b1 and follow this

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,605
路径然后X是相同的B次
path then the X's are the same B times

122
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,045
这个数量与案件的权力和
this quantity to the case power and

123
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,505
这是B的数量减去1
here's that quantity B minus 1 over B

124
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,775
加1，所以你看到一个小B的
plus 1 so you see for a small B that's

125
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,625
这是一个负数，所以它是
that's a negative number so it's

126
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,235
翻转迹象在X的，因为我们看到了
flipping sign in the X's as we saw on

127
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,015
图片
the pictures

128
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,505
留下那部分图片
leave that part of the picture is

129
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,705
纠正Y的不要翻转标志所以这个
correct the Y's don't flip sign so this

130
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:56,985
是XK，当K为0时我们得到BYK就是我
was XK and when K is 0 we got B YK is I

131
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,945
认为这是没有翻转的迹象，使
think is is not flipping a sign so that

132
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,125
看起来的F好，然后FK值
looks good and then FK the value of F

133
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,315
也是相同的数量
also was the same quantity

134
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,945
FK与案件的数量相同
FK is that same quantity to the case

135
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,565
次f0
times f0

136
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,235
所以数量就是最重要的
so that quantity is all all-important

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,255
所以今天演讲的目的是
and so the purpose of today's lecture is

138
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,315
告诉你什么动力术语是什么
to tell you what the momentum term what

139
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,955
改善带来的变化
improvement what change that brings in

140
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,435
我最基本的最陡下降公式
the basic steepest descent formula I'm

141
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,164
要加上另一个正在进行的术语
gonna add on another term which is going

142
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,225
有一些给我们一些记忆
to have some give us some memory of the

143
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:52,545
前面的步骤，所以当我这样做
previous step and so when I do that

144
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,275
我想追踪那种下降
I want to track that kind of descent for

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,345
对于新的加速下降
for the new for the accelerated descent

146
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,995
并跟踪它，看看有什么改进
and track it and see what improvement

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,555
动量术语带来了所以
the momentum term brings and so the

148
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,565
最后的结果将告诉你
final result will be to tell you the

149
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,515
改进了产品
improvement in the produce by the

150
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,845
动量术语也许我有你的时候
momentum term maybe while I have your

151
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,905
注意我会告诉你它现在是什么
attention I'll tell you what it is now

152
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,585
然后我们将详细介绍
and then we'll come the details the

153
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:33,015
代数和我，所以这是我自己的
algebra and to me so this is my own

154
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,385
认为这是代数的奇迹
thought it's a miracle that the algebra

155
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,295
你真的看到这很简单
which is straightforward you really see

156
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,155
特征向量的值
the value of eigenvectors

157
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,285
你知道我们解释了特征向量
you know we explain eigenvectors in

158
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,545
上课，但在这里，你明白为什么如何
class but but here you see why what how

159
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,545
使用它们这的确是一个不错
to use them that's is really a good

160
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,185
但对我而言，这是一个奇迹
exercise but to me it's a miracle that

161
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:04,065
动量的表达非常
the expression with momentum is very

162
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,395
很像那种表达，但不同
much like that expression but different

163
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,625
当然腐烂是一个术语
of course the the the decay is a term

164
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,945
它告诉你腐烂的速度有多快
that tells you how fast the decay is is

165
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,335
更小，所以你就是这样服用K的力量
smaller so you're taking K power so so

166
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,955
如果那样的话，让我写下来
let me I'll write that down if that's

167
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,715
好吧这是我不打算做
all right it's I didn't plan to do to

168
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,595
在开始时揭示最终结果
reveal the final result at the beginning

169
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,955
讲座的，但我想你想
of the lecture but I think you want to

170
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,935
看看我们在哪里这么做
see where we're going so so with

171
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:47,325
势头，我们必须看到这一点
momentum and we have to see what that

172
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:53,025
意味着这个术语1减去B超过1
means this this term of 1 minus B over 1

173
00:10:53,030 --> 00:11:02,195
加B变为
plus B becomes changes to

174
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,315
一个减去B的平方根超过1加
one minus square root of B over 1 plus

175
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,824
广场就这样我提到了
square would be so I mentioned that

176
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,485
之前，但我不认为我写了它
before but but I don't think I wrote it

177
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,465
只是清楚地说明这对我来说是个奇迹
down just clearly so the miracle to me

178
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,334
是为了获得这样一个很好的表达
is to get such a nice expression for the

179
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,315
因为你会看到代数就是它
because you'll see the algebra is it

180
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,365
有效，但它涉及更多
works but it's it's it involves more

181
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,274
因动量而涉及的条款
terms because of momentum involves doing

182
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,965
最小化特征值然而它
a minimization of eigenvalues and yet it

183
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,545
出来很好，然后你有
comes out nicely and and then you have

184
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,514
看到它的重要性所以让我
to see the importance of that so let me

185
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,345
我只想采用相同的例子
I would just take the same example that

186
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,935
如果B超过100，我之前提到过
I mentioned before if B is 1 over 100

187
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:56,144
那么这是0.99超过1.01哦我想
then this is 0.99 over 1.01 oh I think

188
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:05,595
这些在这里有一个正方形2K所以
that these there's a square here 2 K so

189
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,175
如果我们这样的话，我会保留这个
if we're so I'll I'll just keep this

190
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,704
广场上没有什么大变化，但我是
square there no big change but but I'm

191
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,595
现在看着广场
looking at now here at the square

192
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,505
也许广场到处都是你
maybe maybe squares are everywhere you

193
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,954
知道好，所以接近1现在
know ok so so that's close to 1 and now

194
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,625
让我们比较的是什么，我们有这么
let's compare that with what we have so

195
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,584
如果b为1超过100，所以我服用V至是
if B is 1 over 100 so I'm taking V to be

196
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,225
1超过100然后B的平方根是1
1 over 100 then square root of B is 1

197
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,245
超过10所以这是0.9比0.9超过1.1
over 10 so this is 0.9 0.9 over 1.1

198
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,694
平方，这是一个巨大的嗯
squared and there's a tremendous um

199
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,764
比这更小的块是正确的
block smaller than that is right

200
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,625
9/1099/11与99比99
9/10 9 9 / 11 compared to 99 over 101

201
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:02,264
这一个你知道的绝对是哦
this one is you know is definitely oh

202
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,764
对不起，是的，就是这个减少
sorry it's yeah it's this this reduction

203
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,965
因素远低于那个，所以它是一个
factor is well below that one so it's a

204
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,655
值得做的好事，没关系
good thing it's worth doing and okay

205
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,295
现在它涉及什么，好吧，所以我会
now what is it involved okay so I'll

206
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,084
写下for的表达式
write down the expression for the for

207
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,685
讽刺在这里我们没事
the sarcastic here we go okay

208
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,934
所以这是一种看待新X的方法
so here's one way to see it the new X is

209
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:40,725
旧X减去渐变现在
the old X minus the gradient and now

210
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,595
是一个额外的术语，它给了我们一个
comes an extra term which gives us a

211
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,374
很少记忆我很抱歉
little memory well I'm sorry the the

212
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,134
如果我写代数，代数会稍微好一些
algebra is slightly nicer if I write it

213
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,014
有点不同我会创建一个
a little bit differently I'll create a

214
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:13,985
新的数量ZK步长可以
new quantity ZK with a step size okay

215
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,745
好吧，如果我把ZK当成了
okay so if I took ZK to be just the

216
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,444
梯度最陡的下降
gradient that would be steepest descent

217
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,504
一切都没有改变，而是我
nothing has changed but instead I'm

218
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:27,644
要把ZK带到其领先的术语意志
gonna take ZK well its leading term will

219
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:33,045
是渐变但是来了
be the gradient but here comes the

220
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,254
动量术语我添加了多个beta
momentum term I add on a multiple beta

221
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,155
一种方法是先前Z所以
one way to do it is of the previous Z so

222
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,944
Z是搜索方向z是
the Z is the search direction z is the

223
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,194
渐变你正在旅行它是
gradient you're traveling it's the

224
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,045
方向你移动所以它是
direction you're moving so it's

225
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,764
从该方向有不同的
different from that direction there that

226
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:56,504
方向是这个梯度
direction was the gradient this

227
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,175
方向是渐变正确的
direction is the gradient correct

228
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:04,574
用记忆词来纠正动量
corrected by a memory term a momentum

229
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,845
术语和解释的一种方式是
term and one way to interpret that is to

230
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,454
说那个球是想到的
say that that ball is to think of a

231
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,144
沉重的球而不仅仅是一点我
heavy ball instead of just a point I

232
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,725
想到一个沉重的球而不是
think of a heavy ball it instead of

233
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,694
像来一样来回蹦蹦跳跳
bouncing back and forth as as as as

234
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:28,005
它倾向于无用
uselessly as this one it tends to

235
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,825
当然它仍然在两侧反弹
it still bounces of course on the sides

236
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,065
水平集但它下来了
of the level sets but it comes down the

237
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,915
谷更快，这就是效果
valley faster and that's the effect of

238
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,695
这样所以你可以玩不同的
this so so you could play with different

239
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,165
调整术语不同的更正
adjustment terms different Corrections

240
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,395
所以，但我会完成这一个
so but I'll follow through this one

241
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,735
Nesterov还有另一种方法可以做到
Nesterov had another way to make a

242
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,275
改变公式和有
change in the formula and the there are

243
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,465
当然其他人还可以
certainly others beyond that okay

244
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,395
那么，我们如何分析一个很好
so how do we analyze that one well

245
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,645
他们真正的重点是我们有点
they're the real point is we've sort of

246
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,545
通过涉及前一步骤
by taking by involving the previous step

247
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,345
我们现在有一个三级方法
we now have a three level method instead

248
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,055
你可以说两级方法
of a two level method you could say

249
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,745
这就是这只涉及k级
there's this this involves only level k

250
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,515
现在加1和K级公式
plus 1 and level K the formulas now

251
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,315
涉及k加1k和k减1
involve k plus 1 k and k minus 1 it's

252
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,275
就像从第一顺序出发一样
just like going from a first-order

253
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,365
微分方程到二阶
differential equation to a second-order

254
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,925
微分方程
differential equation

255
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,025
是的，我不是真的在想K
it's it's I'm not really thinking that K

256
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,695
是一个时间变量，但在
is a is a time variable but in the

257
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,415
类比K可以是时间变量
analogy K could be a time variable so

258
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,535
在这里，我们喜欢一阶
that here we had like a first-order

259
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,725
等式，如果我想模拟那个
equation if I wanted to model that

260
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,975
那是一种DXDT进入那里
that's sort of a DX DT coming in there

261
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,745
等于梯度和这些模型
equal a gradient and and these models

262
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,515
非常有用，并为之开发
are highly useful and and developed for

263
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,355
一种连续的最陡峭的模型
sort of a continuous model of steepest

264
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,925
下降连续运动而不是
descent a continuous motion instead of

265
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,995
的，而不是离散的运动行
the instead of the discrete motion okay

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,405
那就是那个连续的模型
so that would that's continuous model

267
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,535
因为那个人将是第一个订单
for that guy would be a first order in

268
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,265
这一次的时间将是二阶
time for this one it'll be second order

269
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,805
时间和二阶方程
in time and second order equations of

270
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,685
当然和是常数系数
course and the be constant coefficients

271
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,655
在我们的模型问题和关于
in our model problem and the thing about

272
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,875
我们都知道的二阶方程
a second-order equation that we all know

273
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,815
有一个动量项是一个阻尼项
there's a momentum term a a damping term

274
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,135
你可以说乘以第一个
you could say in multiplying the first

275
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,615
衍生所以这就是什么
derivative so that's what that's what a

276
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,485
二阶方程提供的是
second-order equation offers is the

277
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,355
包含阻尼项而不是
inclusion of a damping term which isn't

278
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,685
存在于原文中
present in the in the original

279
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,195
一阶还好，我们如何分析
first-order okay so how do we analyze

280
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,625
我必须这样你怎么分析
this I have to so how do you analyze

281
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,164
你的二阶微分方程
second-order differential equations you

282
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,355
首先将它们写成两个系统
write them as a system of two first

283
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,904
订购方程式正是如此
order equations so that's exactly what

284
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:25,885
我们将在离散的地方做这里
we're going to do here in the discrete

285
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,205
我们当然会看到我们的情况
case we're going to see of course we

286
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,875
有两个方程式和它们的第一个顺序
have two equations and their first order

287
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,664
而且我们可以让我和他们一起玩
and and we can let me play with them for

288
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,804
几分钟的时间来让他们很好的好了，
a moment to to make them good okay so

289
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:44,664
我会这样，这将是2
I'm gonna have so this will go to 2

290
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,875
第一阶方程，其中第一
first order equations in which the first

291
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,105
一个我要复制XK加1是XK
one I'm just gonna copy XK plus 1 is XK

292
00:18:52,110 --> 00:19:02,395
减去步长ZK哇哇呀，是的
minus at step size ZK whew yeah ok yeah

293
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,345
好的时间以前的时间在这里输入
ok time the previous times type here the

294
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,955
左边的下一步好吧，所以我
the next time step on the left okay so I

295
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,015
刚刚复制了那个我要去的那个
just copied that now this one I'm going

296
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,965
如此才能有提高K内由1
to increase K by 1 so in order to have

297
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,654
我希望写下来
that looking to match this I'll write

298
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,615
因为ZK加1而我将带来
that as Z K plus 1 and I'll bring the

299
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:35,025
case不是gradFk加1等于betaZK
case ain't grad F k plus 1 equal beta ZK

300
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,315
看着你，我就在这里
that look with you I just in this in

301
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,325
这件事而不是看着它
this thing instead of looking at it at

302
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:48,475
我去K加1，我把K
ki I went to K plus 1 and I put the K

303
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,265
一边加1个条款好吧现在我
plus 1 terms on one side okay so now I

304
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,555
有一个
have a a

305
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,095
让我们看看让我们记住我们正在做的事情
and let's see let's remember we're doing

306
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,125
我们正在做的模型是f等于
our the model we're doing is f equal up

307
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,145
1/2X转置sX所以F的梯度
1/2 X transpose s X so the gradient of F

308
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:11,175
是X，所以我写在那里或
is s X so what I've written there or

309
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,235
渐变真的我知道那是什么
gradient is really I know what that

310
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:22,715
渐变是真的sxkplus
gradient is so that's really s xk plus

311
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,165
好吧好的，如何分析那是什么
okay okay how to analyze that what

312
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,325
以K为K，K前进一个
happens as K as K travels forward one

313
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,755
我们有两个三四五个常数
two three four five we have a constant

314
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,585
XZ的每一步系数问题
coefficient problem at every step the XZ

315
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,435
变量乘以a
variable is getting multiplied by a

316
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,875
矩阵所以这里的XZ在k加1和
matrix so here's X Z at k plus 1 and

317
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,965
在这里将是XZ在步骤K和我
over here will be X Z at step K and I

318
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,685
只是要搞清楚矩阵是什么
just have to figure out what matrix is

319
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,455
乘以这里和这里好吧，我
multiplying here and here okay and I

320
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,185
在这里猜测我是第一个看到的
guess here I see it if the first

321
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,915
等式具有1和减去s的外观
equation has a 1 and a minus s looks

322
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,555
就像在第一行，它有一个beta
like in the first row and it has a beta

323
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,155
在第二行，这里是第一行
in the second row and here the first

324
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,465
等式在该行中有10然后
equation has a 1 0 in that row and then

325
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,745
减去s我会输入减号
a minus s I'll put in minus s

326
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,235
将XK加1再乘以1
multiplying XK plus 1 and then the one

327
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,205
那个乘以ZK加1就是全部
that multiplies ZK plus 1 is that all

328
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,795
对
right

329
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,595
对不起，我有2个SS而且我没画画
sorry I've got 2 SS and I didn't draw

330
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,695
那个人没有写那个大的
that one didn't write that one in large

331
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,505
够了，无论如何我打算擦掉它
enough and I'd plan to erase it anyway

332
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,635
这是这个步长
this is the this is the step size this

333
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,415
这是矩阵，但事实并非如此
this is the matrix but but it's it's not

334
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,105
放置它不太合适
it's not quite fitting it's placed this

335
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,405
是我要使用本征的点
is the point where I'm gonna use eigen

336
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,455
价值观我会跟着我跟随每一个
values I'm gonna follow an I follow each

337
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,915
特征值是整点时的
eigen value that's the whole point when

338
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,445
我遵循每个特征值
I follow each eigen value

339
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,935
每个特征向量我应该说我会
each eigenvector I should say I'll

340
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,565
按照s的每个特征向量，让我们
follow each eigenvector of s so let's

341
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,665
让我们这样做，这样我就可以了
let's do that so so I can vectors of s

342
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,865
我们怎么称呼那些lambda
what are we gonna call those lambda

343
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,995
可能是这样的X等于lambdaXI思考
probably so s X equal lambda X I think

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,375
这就是即将到来或QI做的事情
that's what's coming or Q I to do things

345
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,165
我想要记住，s是一个
right I want to remember that s is a

346
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,535
正定对称矩阵
positive definite symmetric matrix

347
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,745
这就是为什么我称它为s而不是它
that's why I called it s instead of a so

348
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,305
我真的应该称之为本征
I really should call the eigen it

349
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:55,005
无所谓但是要在球上让
doesn't matter but to be on the ball let

350
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,885
我称本征向量Q和本征
me call the eigen vector Q and the eigen

351
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:07,155
价值lambda没关系，所以现在我想
value lambda okay okay so now I want to

352
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,815
我想跟随这个特征向量
I want to follow this eigen vector so

353
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,975
我假设XK是CK的一些时间
I'm supposing that X K is some C K times

354
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,705
问：我假设X在跟踪中
Q I'm assuming that X is in the tracking

355
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,255
这个特征向量，我会假设
this eigen vector and I'm gonna assume

356
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,775
ZK是其他一些不变的时间Q.
that ZK is some other constant times Q

357
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,625
大家，你看到那是一个矢量和
everybody do you see that's a vector and

358
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,815
这是一个向量，我想要标量我
that's a vector and I want scalars I

359
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,735
想要吸引标量CK和DK
want to attract just scalar C K and D K

360
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,495
所以我真的在这里
so that's really what I have here is

361
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,915
这有点棘手，因为X在这里
this was a little tricky because X here

362
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,035
是一个向量，两个组件是n
is a vector and two components are n

363
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,885
组件我不想要我真的
components I didn't want that I really

364
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,665
只想跟踪一个特征向量
wanted just to track an eigen vector

365
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,755
一旦我确定了方向Q.
once I've settled on the direction Q

366
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,695
一切的一切都是向量都在
everything is all vectors are in the

367
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,035
Q的方向所以我们就这样了
direction of Q so so we just have

368
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,695
数字看到确实是一条轨道好，所以我
numbers see indeed a track okay so I'm

369
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,345
要改写这个
gonna rewrite this

370
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:17,304
正确，因为是的，让我继续保持
correctly as yeah well let me keep keep

371
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:19,764
按照这个小公式去做什么
going with this little formula then what

372
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:26,065
我需要一个SX将会是什么样的
will I needed an SX what will s xk be if

373
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,945
如果xk在特征方向上
if xk is in the direction of the eigen

374
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,654
矢量Q及其CK当我发生时会发生什么
vector Q and its CK what happens when I

375
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:39,294
乘以是q是一个特征向量
multiply by yes q was an eigen vector so

376
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:43,254
乘以s给了我可以
the multiplying by s gives me I can

377
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,554
价值正确所以它是CKlambdaQ.
value right so it's C K lambda Q

378
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,054
一切都是Q的倍数而且是
everything is a multiple of Q and it's

379
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,205
只有那些我正在寻找的倍数
only those multiples I'm looking for the

380
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,664
海和DS然后是lambda
Seas and the DS and then the lambda

381
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,965
进入S期间，我想是的
comes into the S term yeah I think

382
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:05,695
这可能是我需要做到这一点
that's probably all I need to to do this

383
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,975
然后渐变是啊所以这是
and then the gradient yeah so that's the

384
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,975
渐变当然这是渐变
gradient of course this is the gradient

385
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:19,075
的F好了，取而代之的是让我
of F okay so instead of this let me just

386
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,504
写下发生了什么，如果我是
write what's what's happening if I'm

387
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:25,995
跟踪系数CK加1和
tracking the coefficients CK plus 1 and

388
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,985
DK加1然后我真正的意思
DK plus 1 then what I really meant to

389
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,935
有10和减去s是减号
have there is 1 0 and minus s is a minus

390
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:45,445
lambda是对的，当我
lambda is that right yeah when I

391
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,345
将特征向量乘以s我只是
multiply the eigenvector by s I'm just

392
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,815
开玩笑哦，它是CK的一倍
kidding oh it's a lambda times the CK

393
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,024
是的lambda倍于CK，这对我来说很好
yeah lambda times the CK that's good I

394
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:00,624
认为那是左手边的
think that that's the left-hand side of

395
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:03,745
我的等式，在右边我
my equation and on the right hand side I

396
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:11,995
在这里是1，这是
have here that's 1 and this was the

397
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,085
标量步长，这是
scalar the step size and this was the

398
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,845
其他系数是SNbeta所以我
other coefficient it's the SN beta so I

399
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,674
我想选择现在的目的
want to choose what's my purpose now

400
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,484
这给了我
that gives me the

401
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:29,034
在C和C的每一步都会发生什么
what happens at every step to the C and

402
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,114
D所以我想选择土地了
D so I want to choose the land the the

403
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,274
我有两件事我可以随意
two things that I have I'm free to

404
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,825
选择我们的s和beta，这是我的大事
choose our s and beta so that's my big

405
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:46,134
大工作选择s和beta现在我好
big job choose s and beta okay now I to

406
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:49,854
让哦让我塑造这个事情了
make oh let me just shape this thing up

407
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,404
按月乘以倒数
by month by multiplying the inverse of

408
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,864
这一点，把它在这里，这样很好
that and get it over here so that well

409
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,954
真的，你会看到一切所以CK加
really you'll see everything so CK plus

410
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:03,624
一个DK加一个什么是倒数
one DK plus one what's the inverse of

411
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:04,734
一零
one zero

412
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,274
哦，我不认为我想要那样
oh I don't think I wanna that would have

413
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:12,354
一个艰难的时期找到一个逆转它是一个
a tough time finding an inverse it was a

414
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:21,565
一个不是它是的好，所以我想
one wasn't it yeah okay so I want to

415
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,274
乘以该矩阵的倒数
multiply by the inverse of that matrix

416
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,724
在这里得到它，是什么
to get it over here and what's the

417
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,624
倒数11减去lamda它是1加1
inverse of 1 1 minus lamda it's 1 1 plus

418
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:34,074
lambda使逆转带来了它
lambda so that the inverse brought it

419
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,514
在这里时间这个矩阵10beta和
over here times this matrix 1 0 beta and

420
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:41,364
减去步长是什么的
minus the step size that's what

421
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:46,394
倍增CKDK所以我们有这些
multiplies C KD K so we have these

422
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,114
简单漂亮的步骤来了
simple beautiful steps which which come

423
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,354
从跟踪一个特征向量得到
from tracking one eigenvector makes the

424
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,604
整个问题标量，所以我乘以那些
whole problem scalar so I multiply those

425
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,214
在我们的两个矩阵中我终于得到了
two matrices in our I finally get the

426
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,924
矩阵，我真的要想一想
matrix that I really have to think about

427
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:05,394
10倍，即1减去slambda1
1 0 times that'll be 1 minus s lambda 1

428
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,474
在那里将成为一个lambda的时代
times that will be a lambda there and

429
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:12,685
减去lambdas加betabeta减去
minus lambda s plus beta beta minus

430
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,494
lambda是我们看到的矩阵
lambda s that's the matrix that we see

431
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:28,125
在每一步让我称之为矩阵哦
at every step let me call that matrix Oh

432
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,745
所以我比我做了更多的代数
so I've done some algebra more than I

433
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,015
总是会在演讲中做，但事实如此
would always do in a lecture but it's

434
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,415
真的，如果不是，我就不会这样做
really my I wouldn't do it if it wasn't

435
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,715
好的代数是什么结论了
nice algebra what's the conclusion the

436
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,105
结论是有了动力
conclusion is that with the momentum

437
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,335
这个数字beta的术语可用于
term with this number beta available to

438
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,355
选择以及S中的步骤
choose as well as s the step the

439
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,555
特征值的系数
coefficient of the eigenvalue

440
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,525
特征向量在每一步都相乘
eigenvector is multiplied at every step

441
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,375
通过该矩阵rr是那个矩阵和
by that matrix r r is that matrix and of

442
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,055
当然矩阵涉及到
course that matrix involves the

443
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:13,515
特征值是的，所以我们要考虑一下
eigenvalue yep so we have to think about

444
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,425
我们现在想要做什么
what what do we want to do now we want

445
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:24,175
选择beta和s来制作我们的
to choose beta and s to make our as

446
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,295
小编为大家想使可能的权
small as possible right we want to make

447
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,965
我们尽可能小，我们是自由的
our as small as possible and we're free

448
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,025
选择beta和s但我们只是我们的
to choose beta and s but we but our

449
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,495
取决于lambda所以我要做
depends on lambda so I'm going to make

450
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,985
它尽可能小，在整个
it as small as possible over the whole

451
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,375
范围可能的lambdas所以让我
range of possible lambdas so so let me

452
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,185
所以现在我们真的去了
so now here we really go so we have

453
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:57,325
一些这些之间的lambda是这些
lambda between some these are these are

454
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:03,745
s的本征特征值和我们的特征值
the eigen eigen value of s and what we

455
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,205
知道什么是合理的知道
know what's what's reasonable to know is

456
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,465
下限这是一个积极的，这是一个
a lower bound it's a positive this is a

457
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,955
对称正定矩阵
symmetric positive definite matrix a

458
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,005
下界和上界
lower bound and an upper bound for

459
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:22,365
例如，M是B，M是其中之一
example and M was B and M was one in

460
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,485
那个二乘二的问题就是这个
that two-by-two problem and this is what

461
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,375
我们知道特征值是
we know that the eigen values are

462
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:36,885
M＆M之间的比例
between M&M and the ratio of

463
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:46,615
M2M很好，如果我不买对的，这是这个
m2m well if I buy right this is the this

464
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,455
是关键数量，它是什么叫它
is the key quantity and what's it called

465
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,325
lambdamax除以lambdamin是
lambda max divided by lambda min is the

466
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,644
条件号码这就是全部
condition number right this is all

467
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:01,315
有时写Kappa希腊字母
sometimes written Kappa Greek letter

468
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:10,705
Kappa的条件数和时间
Kappa the condition number of s and when

469
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,294
这个问题很重要
that's big that then the problem is

470
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,304
将是困难时，这是一个
going to be harder when that's one that

471
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,794
然后矩阵只是一个倍数
then the matrix is just a multiple of

472
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,745
单位矩阵和所述问题是
the identity matrix and the problem is

473
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,534
当这个时候资本何时何时琐碎
trivial when this when when when capital

474
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,215
在它m和小米相同，则
in it m and small m are the same then

475
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,315
这是说，规模最大，
that's saying that the largest and

476
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,205
最小的特征值是相同的
smallest eigen values are identical that

477
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,575
该矩阵是的倍数
that the matrix is a multiple of the

478
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,995
这是条件第一的身份
identity that's the condition number one

479
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,815
但是糟糕的是当它结束时
but but the bad one is when it's 1 over

480
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,495
B在我们的例子中，它可以
B in our example and it and that could

481
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,664
非常大可以，这就是我们所拥有的
be very large okay that's where we have

482
00:31:53,669 --> 00:32:00,674
一个问题让我只是插入一下
a problem let me just insert about the

483
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:06,985
普通的梯度下降当然了
ordinary gradient descent of course the

484
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,375
教科书找到了有多快的估计
textbooks find a estimate for how fast

485
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,705
那当然是取决于那个
that is and of course it depends on that

486
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,804
数
number

487
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,815
是啊所以它依赖于数量和E
yeah so it depends on that number and E

488
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,264
对，你确切地看到它是如何依赖的
right you exactly saw how it depended on

489
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:26,125
这个号码没错，但现在我们有了
that number right but now we have a

490
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,644
不同的问题，我们要完成
different problem and we're gonna finish

491
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:31,345
没关系，那我的工作是什么呢？
it okay so what's my job I'm gonna

492
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:37,375
选择s和beta来保持
choose s and beta to get to keep the the

493
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,595
R的本征值让我们给出
eigen values of R so let's give the

494
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,804
RNA的本征值所以R让我们说R有
eigen values of RNA so R let's say R has

495
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,435
特征值
eigen values

496
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:55,005
我赢得了取决于lambda和
II won that depends on on the lambda and

497
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:00,975
s和beta以及E-所以那些是
the s and the beta and E - so those are

498
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,365
我们刚才给出的特征值
the eigenvalues of our just giving a

499
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,525
给他们的信，那么我们的工作是什么
letter to to them so what's our job we

500
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,755
想要选择s和beta来制作它们
want to choose s and beta to make those

501
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,295
特征值尽可能小
eigenvalues as small as possible right

502
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,125
如果r小，则小的特征值
small eigenvalues if r has small

503
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,395
特征值它的力量看到我们每一个
eigenvalues its powers see we ever every

504
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,965
步骤乘以r使收敛
step multiplies by r so the convergence

505
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,495
动量率依赖于
rate with momentum is depends on the

506
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,495
我们快速变小的力量吧
powers of our getting small fast it

507
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,835
取决于特征值很小
depends on the eigenvalues being small

508
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:45,285
我们希望尽量减少最大的
we want to minimize the largest

509
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:51,195
特征值所以我会说e的最大值
eigenvalue so I'll say the maximum of e

510
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,065
1和每个和E2这是我们的工作
1 and each and E 2 that's our job

511
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,735
最小化我们想要选择s和beta
minimize we want to choose s and beta to

512
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,795
最小化最大特征值因为
minimize the largest eigenvalue because

513
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,805
如果有一个小的特征值，但是
if there's one small eigenvalue but the

514
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,575
另一个很大，另一个很重要
other is big then the other one is going

515
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,945
杀了我们所以我们必须得到两者
to kill us so we have to get both

516
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,635
特征值下降，当然还有那些
eigenvalues down and of course those

517
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,414
取决于lambdae1取决于lambda
depend on lambda e 1 depends on lambda

518
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,965
所以我们有一点代数问题
so we have a little algebra problem and

519
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,965
这就是我所描述的奇迹
this is what I described as a miracle

520
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,365
这个小代数的事实
the fact that this little algebra

521
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,215
问题是该矩阵的特征值
problem the eigenvalues of that matrix

522
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,595
e1和e2在某些方面取决于lambda
e1 and e2 which depend on lambda in some

523
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,914
在某种程度上，我们想要制作两个e1
in some way and we want to make both e1

524
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:41,055
和e2最小的那些
and e2 small the maximum of those of

525
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,105
他们，我们必须为所有人做
them and we have to do it for all the

526
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,205
特征所有特征值lambda因为
eigen all the eigenvalues lambda because

527
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,375
我们现在必须认为我们一直都是
we have to we're now thinking we've been

528
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,275
跟踪每个特征向量，以便给出
tracking each eigenvector so that gave

529
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,275
我们1所以这是所有可能的lambda
us 1 so this is for all possible lambda

530
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,395
哦，所以我们必须决定我的意思
oh so we have to decide what do I mean

531
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,345
所有意大利面
by all pasta

532
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,315
lambda和我的意思是所有的lambda
lambda and I mean all lambda that are

533
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:14,915
在一些M＆M之间有一个美丽的
between some M&M there is a beautiful

534
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,905
你有一个二乘二矩阵的问题
problem you have a two-by-two matrix you

535
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,475
可以找到它找到它的特征值的
can find it it find its eigenvalues its

536
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,445
它依赖于lambda和我们所有人
it they depend on lambda and what we all

537
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,725
我们所知道的λ是它的M之间
we know about lambda is it's between m

538
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,685
并与capya也是他们也依赖
and and capya and also they also depend

539
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,055
在s和beta上我们可以使用两个参数
on s and beta the two parameters we can

540
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,515
选择，我们想选择那些
choose and we want to choose those

541
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,895
参数使所有的所有
parameters so that for for all the all

542
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,105
可能的特征值越大
the possible eigenvalues the larger of

543
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,655
两个特征值将小到
the two eigenvalues will be as small as

544
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,165
可能这就是它的一点点
possible that's it's a little bit of

545
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,345
代数但你知道那是那个吗？
algebra but it's do you see that that's

546
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,675
我不应该说狡猾的棘手
the tricky that I shouldn't say tricky

547
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,975
因为它出来就是这个
because it comes out that's that this is

548
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,885
一来就是一个奇迹中
the one that is a miracle in the in the

549
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,155
简单的解决方案好吧，我
simplicity of the solution okay and I'm

550
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,735
会影响也许我会搬到这里
gonna effect maybe I'll move over here

551
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:17,795
把答案写好，我只是想要
to write the answer okay and I just want

552
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,645
说奇迹不会发生
to say that miracles don't happen so

553
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,755
通常在数学中，你知道所有的
often in math there's you know all of

554
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,525
数学的全部要点是数学
mathematics the whole point of math is

555
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,535
解释奇迹所以有一个
to explain miracles so there is a

556
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,595
这里有一些东西要解释我
there's something to explain here and I

557
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,335
没有我的手指上还因
don't have my finger on it yet because

558
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,005
无论如何它发生了让我告诉你
anyway it happens so let me tell you

559
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,485
什么是正确的和正确的beta和
what the right s and the right beta and

560
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:53,785
得到的最小特征值是这样的
the resulting minimum eigen value are so

561
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:59,395
他们又依赖于小米和大米
again they depend on little m and Big M

562
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,805
这是我们非常好的功能
that's a very nice feature which we

563
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,485
预计，这是他们依赖
expect and that is and they depend on

564
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,425
这个比例没关系，所以这个比例还好
the ratio okay so that ratio alright

565
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:17,755
让我们看看它没关系，所以最好的
let's let's see it okay so the best s

566
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:26,825
S最优具有公式二
the S optimal has the formula two over

567
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,825
lambdamax的平方根就是
square root of lambda max that's the

568
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,215
M的平方根和平方根
square root of M and the square root of

569
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:42,955
MSquared令人惊叹的好和beta最佳
M Squared amazing okay and beta optimal

570
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,265
原来是M的平方根
turns out to be the square root of M

571
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,055
减去小米的平方根
minus the square root of little m over

572
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,485
MPLUS平方的平方根
the square root of M plus the square

573
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,575
所有平方的小M的根
root of little M all the squared of

574
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,765
当然我们知道这些数字是1
course we know what these numbers are 1

575
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,525
和我们的模型问题中的beta
and beta in our model problem that's

576
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,975
在哪里我会得到这个平方根
where I'm gonna get this square root of

577
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,725
这是1减去广场对不起B这个
this is 1 minus the square sorry B this

578
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,155
实际上是1减去B的平方根
is 1 minus the square root of B in fact

579
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,885
雅为我们的例子好吧让我
ya for our for our example well let me

580
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,305
只要写出2比1的内容
just write what they would be 2 over 1

581
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:27,305
乙广场和1个减去加平方根
plus square root of B Square and 1 minus

582
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,305
将超过1加方你看
would be over 1 plus square you see

583
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,595
这是1减去B的平方根
where this is 1 minus square root of B

584
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,055
作为一个开始出现现在它出现
as a beginning to appear now it appears

585
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,125
在解决这个问题然后
in the solution of this problem and then

586
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:45,245
我得告诉你怎么回事
I have to tell you what the what how

587
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,415
小确实做了这些这些最佳选择
small did do these these optimal choices

588
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,715
让我们的这项权利的特征值
make the eigenvalues of our right this

589
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,165
是我们真正关注的
is what we're really paying attention to

590
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,985
因为它的特征值是该
because it's the eigen values that that

591
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,535
矩阵告诉我们每个人都会发生什么
matrix tells us what happens at every

592
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,565
步骤及其特征值必须是
step and the its eigen values have to be

593
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,205
如何获得快速收敛
small to get fast convergence so how

594
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,745
他们很好，他们涉及这个
small are they well they involve this

595
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,115
是的，这是我见过的数字
yeah so it's the number that I've seen

596
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,665
所以在这种情况下轻松了
so so in this case the ease the

597
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:27,005
特征值
eigenvalues

598
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:32,055
我们那是迭代矩阵
of our that's the iterating matrix are

599
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,545
现在我们现在你要去了
below that now we're now you're gonna

600
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,325
看到一个-都将超过1加
see that one - were to be over 1 plus

601
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:43,455
我们认为也许平方让我
we're to be I think maybe squared let me

602
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,084
只是看是的是的它恰好来了
just see yeah yeah it happens to come

603
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:51,135
再次出这个数字，这就是
out that number again so that's the

604
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,765
结论是正确的选择
conclusion that was the right choice of

605
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:01,275
s和beta通过添加这个回顾期限
s and beta by adding this look-back term

606
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,305
回头一步，你得到这个
look back one step you get this

607
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:11,265
改善，这是你看到的
improvement and it's it happens you see

608
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,265
它在实践当然你会看到它
it in practice of course you'll see it

609
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:25,065
确切地说，你完成了这项工作
exactly and so you you do the job to use

610
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,885
现在的势头我会提到什么
momentum now I'm going to mention what

611
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:31,395
NesterovNesterov有一点点
the Nesterov Nesterov had a slightly

612
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,065
不同的方式去做，我会告诉你
different way to do it and i'll tell you

613
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,775
这是什么，但它是相同的想法得到
what that is but it's the same idea get

614
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,295
第二件事让我们看看能不能
a second thing so let's see if I can

615
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:51,854
发现是的nestor哦，好的，我们在这里
find that yeah nestor oh ok ok here we

616
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:52,245
走
go

617
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,575
所以让我给内斯特打下个名字
so let me bring Nestor offs a name down

618
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:05,295
所以这基本上就是我
so that that's the basically what I

619
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,665
我想说的是第一和什么时候
wanted to say about number one and when

620
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,765
你已经看到了这个低谷你会看到的
you've seen this trough you'll see that

621
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,515
这是一个类似的想法涉及到
it's a similar idea of involving the

622
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:20,505
以前的时间值确定还有
previous time value ok there are very

623
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:25,515
现在用于机器的流行方法
popular methods in use now for machine

624
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,325
通过简单的学习来学习
learning that involves by a simple

625
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,805
通过以下方式计算所有先前的值
formula all the previous values by by

626
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,195
只是增加了一堆
sort of just by an addition of a bunch

627
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,775
条款所以它确实如此
of terms so it's really it

628
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:45,455
所以这就是ADAADA的名称
so it's it goes under the names ADA ADA

629
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,705
毕业或其他人已经
grad or others those of you who already

630
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,824
了解机器学习会知道
know about machine learning will know

631
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:56,475
我在说什么，我会说
what I'm speaking about and I'll say

632
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,554
更多关于那些是的，但事实并非如此
more about those yeah but it doesn't

633
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,125
每个都包含一个单独的系数
involve a separate coefficient for each

634
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,304
以前的价值或者是一个
previous value or that would be a

635
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:09,854
现在我做了大量的工作
momentous amount of work so so now I

636
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:11,685
只是想告诉你涅斯捷罗夫是什么
just want to tell you what Nesterov is

637
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,294
然后我们好OK先生。罗菲的
and then we were good ok mr. roffe's

638
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:20,175
想法让我把它带下来
idea let me bring that down

639
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:31,665
因为他有这个，所以把它打倒了
shoot this up bring down because he had

640
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,885
你可能没有想过的想法
an idea that you might not have thought

641
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,544
不知怎的，动量想法很漂亮
of somehow the momentum idea was pretty

642
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:41,265
自然地使用以前的值和
natural to use that previous value and

643
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,965
其实我想知道什么
actually I would like to know what

644
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,215
如果您使用两个先前的值，则会发生
happens if you use two previous values

645
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,554
或者你可以使用之前的三个值
or three previous values can you then

646
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,655
对此有所改进
get improvements on this this

647
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,665
回归两步收敛率
convergence rate by going back two steps

648
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:03,455
或者如果我使用类比的三个步骤
or three steps if I use the analogy with

649
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,125
常微分方程可能
ordinary differential equations maybe

650
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,574
你知道的就是这样，所以有
you know so right so so there are

651
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:13,094
后向差异公式你知道吗？
backward difference formulas do you know

652
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,824
关于这四个人的情况
about those four those would be in

653
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:19,804
MATLAB软件和所有其他软件
MATLAB software and all other software

654
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:22,905
落后的差异，所以也许你去
backward differences so maybe you go

655
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,314
如果你是的话，回来两步或四步
back two steps or four steps if you're

656
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:30,074
如果你正在进行行星计算
doing planetary calculations if you're

657
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,715
天文学家，你可能会回到七或
an astronomer you go back maybe seven or

658
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,114
八个步骤，以获得超高精度
eight steps to get super high accuracy

659
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,495
所以似乎没有发生过
so that doesn't seem to have happened

660
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,614
不过也应该发生在这里回去
yet but it should happen here to go back

661
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:46,125
更但却涅斯捷罗夫将具有它
more but but Nesterov will has it has

662
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,314
这种不同的回归方式让他如此
this different way to go back so his

663
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,595
公式是XK加一种新方法
formula is XK plus one the new way

664
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,275
是YK所以他正在介绍一些东西
is YK so he's introducing something a

665
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:09,125
有点不同-s辐射f@YK我是
little different - s radiant f @ YK I'm

666
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,075
对YK有点惊讶但是
a little surprised about that YK but

667
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,135
这是渐变的重点
this is the point here that the gradient

668
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,595
正在评估一些不同的
is being evaluated at some different

669
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,465
然后他必须给出一个公式
point and then he has to give a formula

670
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,065
那些跟踪那些明智的人
for that for those to track those wise

671
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,815
所以Y和X一样，但它们是
so the Y's are like the X's but they're

672
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,305
在一段时间内转移了一点点
shifted a little bit by some term and

673
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:37,475
测试就可以了哦，不行呀公测有
beta would be fine Oh No yeah beta have

674
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,075
我们得到了涅斯捷罗夫这里是老总掉了
we got Nesterov here yes mister off has

675
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:47,045
耶和华的因素，所以我没事
a factor gamma in yeah so I all right

676
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,864
让我让我尝试获得这项权利好吗
let me let me try to get this right okay

677
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:54,635
上一行我已经没事了
all right on the previous line I've

678
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,065
在这里写了整个巢穴的东西
written the whole nestdrop thing here

679
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,465
让我们完全看到漂亮的下降然后
let's see nice drop completely and then

680
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,445
他们会打破那么这是一步，
they'll break then this is the step that

681
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,815
把它分成两个第一顺序但是
breaks it into two first order but

682
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,415
你会在这里看到XKplus的主要公式
you'll see the main formula here XK plus

683
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:17,255
1是XK，然后β倍XK减去
1 is XK and then a beta times XK minus

684
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,455
XK减1，这就像一个动量
XK minus 1 so that's like a momentum

685
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:27,095
术语，然后是典型的梯度，但现在
term and then a typical gradient but now

686
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,335
这是Nesterov说出这个低谷
here's Nesterov speaking up this trough

687
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,205
评估梯度不是在XK而不是在
evaluates the gradient not at XK not at

688
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:37,595
XK减去1，但它是家里先生。奥兹点
XK minus 1 but it is home mr. Oz point

689
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,104
就像这样，这是Nesterov说我最喜欢的
like so this is Nesterov say my favorite

690
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:46,075
点伽玛XK减XK减1
point gamma XK minus XK minus 1 some

691
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:55,655
指向该步骤的一部分，所以它
point part way along that step so it so

692
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,114
这一点，因为伽玛将是
this point because gamma is going to be

693
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,735
一些非整数这个评价点
some non integer this evaluation point

694
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,685
对于F的梯度
of for the gradient of F

695
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,685
有点意外和奇怪，因为
is a little unexpected and weird because

696
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,285
它不是一个网格点，它在某个地方
it's not a mesh point it's somewhere

697
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:20,555
之间好吧是的，然后就是这样
between okay yep yep and then that so

698
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,975
涉及XK加1XK和XK减去
that involves XK plus 1 XK and XK minus

699
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:33,485
1所以这是一个二阶有一个
1 so it's a second-order there's a

700
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,975
我们要去的二阶方法
second-order method here we're going to

701
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,495
分析它我们将要去
it to analyze it we're going to go

702
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,765
通过与此相同写它的过程
through this same process of writing it

703
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,385
作为前两个的两个一阶步骤
as two first-order steps to first two

704
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,395
单步从k到k加一步
single step to one step from k to k plus

705
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:58,955
1所涉及的耦合一步法事情遵循
1 a a coupled one-step thing follow that

706
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,195
同样的事情，然后结果
same thing through and then the result

707
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,875
对他来说是一个相同的因素
is a same factor appears for him

708
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,615
同样的因素这也是如此
the same factor this is also so this the

709
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:21,605
点是这是动力和
point is this is for momentum and

710
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:30,495
涅斯捷罗夫与一些人
Nesterov with with some with some

711
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,895
常数差由一些不同的
constant difference different by some

712
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,585
不变但关键数量是
constant but the key quantity is that

713
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:46,125
一个和那个出现在两个所以我
one and that appears in both so so so I

714
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,975
当然不建议重复这些
don't propose of course to repeat these

715
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,765
酯的步骤，但你看到了什么
steps for an ester off but you see what

716
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,365
你看到你能做什么，你看到了
you see what you could do you see that

717
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:59,775
它涉及K减1Kink加1你
it involves K minus 1 K in k plus 1 you

718
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,945
当你按照一个特征向量写它
write it as you follow an eigen vector

719
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,575
你把它写成一个耦合系统
you write it as a coupled system of

720
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,635
这是一个有一个矩阵的一步
that's a one-step that has a matrix you

721
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,095
找到你找到特征的矩阵
find the matrix you find the eigen

722
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,285
你做的那些矩阵的值
values of the matrix you make those

723
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,775
特征值尽可能小，你
eigenvalues as small as possible and you

724
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,255
优化了它们的系数
have optimized their coefficients in

725
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,115
Nesterov确定那是那么多
Nesterov ok that's that's sort of a lot

726
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,215
代数的核心是
of algebra that's at the heart of

727
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,315
加速梯度下降和
accelerated gradient descent and of

728
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,695
当然值得做，因为它是一个
course it's worth doing because it's a

729
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,265
在中的巨大储蓄
tremendous saving in the in the in the

730
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:45,555
收敛率确定任何人都跑了
convergence rate ok anybody running in

731
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,695
马拉松或只是看着它
the marathon or just watching it's

732
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,165
无论如何我都会看到你可能知道
possible to run you know anyway I'll see

733
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,830
you after the marathon next Wednesday

734
00:48:54,170 --> 00:49:01,990
你下周三马拉松之后

735
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,990
博伊德教授也会见到你
and professor Boyd will also see you
