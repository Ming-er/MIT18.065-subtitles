所以大家好，我是AlanEdelman和
so hi everybody I'm Alan Edelman and

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,875
帮助了一点教这门课
helped a little bit to teach this class

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,175
去年但很高兴看到它
last year but happy to see that it's

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,785
今年这么好教授
going great this year so professor

13
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,385
斯特朗来教你1806年的一些人
Strang came to teach 1806 some of you

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,905
可能知道介绍线性
may know the the introductory linear

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,175
代数课程和Strang教授来了
algebra course and professor Strang came

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,264
通过并给出了这个伟大的示范
by and gave this great demonstration

17
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:47,554
关于行等于列
about the row rank equals the column

18
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,175
排名，我想知道，如果你这样做
rank and I'm wondering if you did that

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,154
在这个课程中，他们随时都可以
in this class at any time or would they

20
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,185
已经看到它在笔记中很好
have seen that it's in the notes well in

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,995
无论如何，就像斯特朗教授一样
in any event just as professor Strang

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,505
走了这里，我会抓住这个
walked out so here I'll just grab this

23
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,335
这真的是我真的要开始了
this is truly I was actually gonna start

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,465
编写代码来做四边形
writing the code to do the quadrilateral

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,905
但是我没有足够的时间
but I didn't have enough time you could

26
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,065
看到我开始，但这是重点
see me starting but here's the point

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,735
五个这很容易，所以三角
five for the triangle which was easy so

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,144
这与朱莉娅的故事有什么关系
that what's the story with Julia in this

29
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,765
上课了他们用了一点还是一点
class have they used it a little or a

30
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,405
很多或在实验室中你使用过Julia但是
lot or in the labs you've used Julia but

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,394
那只是MATLAB，所以那是
that was just MATLAB so that was but

32
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:26,555
好吧，所以斯特朗教授表示
okay so so so professor Strang showed

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,015
这个证明他会放下一个
this proof where he would he put down a

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,025
三乘三矩阵它排名第二
three by three matrix it had rank two

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,635
并且他展示了你知道的
and he showed the you know took the

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,254
你知道前两个的列
columns that were you know the first two

37
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,594
列是独立的，而且是
columns were independent and and was

38
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,215
你很容易知道它很容易显示出来
easy you know it was easy to show the

39
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,555
行排名等于后面的列排名
row rank equals the column rank after

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,415
我问道，StrangRoy教授出去了
professor Strang Roy went out I asked

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,314
那会对零矩阵起作用吗？
would that work for the zero matrix so

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,495
所以这里的零矩阵和自
so here's the the zero matrix and since

43
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,545
我真的不告诉你的证明
I'm not really telling you the proof

44
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,534
我只想说如果我要交配
I'll just say if I were to put a mate if

45
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,665
我是按字面意思制作矩阵的
I were to make a matrix of the literally

46
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,974
这个矩阵的独立列是什么
independent columns of this matrix what

47
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,135
我会这样做吗？
would I do

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,805
所以这可能看起来很棘手
so it's zero sort of a might seem tricky

49
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,385
这不是那么棘手，但事实并非如此
it's not really that tricky but this is

50
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,624
你走出去的那一刻我做了什么
what I did the moment you walked out so

51
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,064
所以是的，所以我有三个这三个
so yeah so I've got this three by three

52
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,975
矩阵，我需要迈出第一步
matrix and I need to make a first step

53
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,555
在我需要的证据中
in and whatever the proof was I needed

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,975
取字面上的列
to take the columns of the the literally

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,765
该矩阵的独立列和
independent columns of this matrix and

56
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,765
把它们放在自己的矩阵中
place them in a matrix of their own what

57
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,465
我会这样做是一个空矩阵
would I do it would be an empty matrix

58
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,814
什么是这个空的大小
what would be the size of this empty

59
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:35,995
矩阵不完全为零，因为
matrix not exactly zero by zero because

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,125
每一列都在我们的每一列
where every every column is still in our

61
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,945
三，你看到了我希望的正确答案
three you see so the right answer I hope

62
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,435
这是有道理的是三乘三
this makes sense is a three by zero

63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,135
空矩阵，这是一个概念
empty matrix and that's a concept that

64
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,625
存在于MATLAB和Julia及其中
exists in MATLAB and in Julia and in

65
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,785
Python我觉得我很有信心
Python I think I'm sure and in any

66
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,245
计算机语言，所以如果你有一个完整的
computer language so if you had a full

67
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,945
秩3x3矩阵线性独立
rank 3x3 matrix the linearly independent

68
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,325
如果你，列将是三乘三
columns would be three by three if you

69
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,885
排名第二的是三乘二
had a rank two would be three by two

70
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,075
他们已经有一个等级一个矩阵它会是
they've had a rank one matrix it'd be

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,685
如果我没有列，那就三个一个
three by one so if I had no columns

72
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,565
零三有意义并完成
three by zero makes sense and to finish

73
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,785
再次证明我不是在说这些
the proof again I'm not telling these

74
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,165
学生们显然是在笔记中
students it's in the notes apparently

75
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,595
下一个矩阵是R和零
the next matrix would be R and of zero

76
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,575
三，当然你和你相乘
three and of course you multiply and you

77
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,645
获得零的三乘三矩阵，
get a three by three matrix of zeros so

78
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,355
很有趣地看到，该证明还
it's fun to see that that proof still

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,915
即使没有零矩阵也能工作
works even for the zero matrix without

80
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,135
任何真正的年龄，所以这就是今天嗯
any real age so that was just today um

81
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,005
让我另一件事是让我可以
let me the other thing is let me can I

82
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,454
说一两句关于最近的事情
say a word or two about recent stuff

83
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,425
关于朱莉娅所以我开始整理一个
about Julia so I start to put together a

84
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,245
说它还没准备好，但我会
talk it's not really ready yet but I'll

85
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,065
无论如何要与你分享，所以谷歌做了
share it with you anyway so Google did

86
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,495
朱莉娅世界上周对我很感兴趣
the Julia world a big favor last week I

87
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,855
这意味着这是巨大的，所以你们都知道
mean this is huge so you all know

88
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,505
机器学习很可能很热
machine learning is hot that's probably

89
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,755
为什么你可能在这堂课
why you're here in this class I probably

90
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,535
不必告诉你，但我
don't have to tell you and yet I

91
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,905
如果你们中的一些人不会感到惊讶
wouldn't be surprised if a number of you

92
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,675
对整个这一切都有点希望
were sort of wish the whole this whole

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,385
class是Python或者其他东西
class was in Python or something or

94
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,005
也许MATLAB左右我不怀疑
maybe MATLAB or so I don't doubt that

95
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,514
你们中的一些人可能想要那样做
some of you might have wanted that to

96
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,255
发生了，我们受到轰炸
happen and we get sort of bombarded with

97
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,005
你知道为什么Python不是那么多
with you know why not Python not so much

98
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,534
MATLAB了，但你知道为什么不
MATLAB anymore but you know why not

99
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,275
Python是那种而来的问题
Python is sort of the issue that comes

100
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,315
很多，我可以说话直到奶牛
up a lot and I could talk til the cows

101
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,695
回家但没有人会相信我
come home but nobody would believe me

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,414
但谷歌上周出来并表示
but Google came out last week and said

103
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:29,645
说到机器
that that when it comes to machine

104
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,205
学习那里真的有两种语言
learning there really are two languages

105
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,575
它足够强大，可以做机器
that are powerful enough to do machine

106
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,875
学习做机器学习的各种
learning to do machine learning kinds of

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,795
你想做的事情和一些事情
things that you want to do and in some

108
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,224
感受今天其余的讲座
sense the the rest of today's lecture

109
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,755
我将给予的意志将是
that I'm going to give will will be

110
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,695
也许这是插图，但如果你
maybe illustrations of this but if you

111
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,105
希望你能去看看他们的
want you can go and look at their their

112
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,795
博客在这里
blog here

113
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,564
他们做的是他们基本上是这样的
what they do is they basically sort of

114
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,545
用一大堆开始比赛
start the the race with a whole bunch of

115
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,105
编程语言有Python
programming languages there's Python

116
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,045
他们是我们的JavaJavaScript
there's our Java JavaScript they they're

117
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,724
你知道他们有点看
you know they they they sort of look at

118
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,974
所有这些语言，如果你读
all of these languages and if you read

119
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,145
你会看到的博客，但我们会
the blog you'll see but we're gonna

120
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,124
根据技术优点和过滤它们
filter them out on technical merits and

121
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,735
然后很多人就会消失
and right away a lot of them disappear

122
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,045
包括Python和Java
including Python and Java

123
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,844
如果你去，他们实际上会花钱
and and they actually spend if you go to

124
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,194
博客，你会看到他们花了很多钱
the blog you'll see they spend a great

125
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,654
因为有关Python故事的时间问题
deal of time on the Python story because

126
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,004
他们知道人们会想要
they know that people are gonna want to

127
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,564
听到一个正确我的意思是，如果人们
hear that one right I mean if people

128
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,914
想要被说服，所以有
want to be convinced and so there's

129
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,555
实际上多个屏幕已满
actually multiple screens full on the

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,205
Python之所以不好
the reason why Python is just not good

131
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,085
足够机器学习所以他们
enough for machine learning so they they

132
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,534
留下语言留下juliaswiftc++
leave for languages left julia swift c++

133
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,814
和防锈，然后进行排序，他们的下一个
and rust and then sort of they the next

134
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,944
如果你去的那部分
sort of part of the if you go to the

135
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,825
他们过滤的博客的下一部分
next part of of the blog they filter on

136
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,805
可用性然后再两个咬一口
usability and then two more so to bite

137
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,814
灰尘
the dust

138
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,115
所以c++和锈就消失了
so c++ and rust disappeared and then

139
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,795
他们去说，这些都是
they go on to say that these are the

140
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,775
只有他们认为的两种语言
only two languages they feel are

141
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,175
适合机器学习和
appropriate for machine learning and

142
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,745
他们把这个很好的报价你知道了
they put this nice quote you know that

143
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,154
你知道它有很多共同之处
that you know it shares many common

144
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,314
价值观，他们实际上继续下去
values and they actually go on and about

145
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,115
什么机器学习真正需要和
what machine learning really needs and

146
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,395
你知道吗，我建议你看看
you know yeah i'd recommend you look at

147
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,224
它然后最终当然是他们
it and then finally of course they're

148
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,615
要迅速推动他们的那些
gonna push swift which they which they

149
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,594
应该这样他们有更多的blahblah
should so they had some more blahblah

150
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,425
有关更多的人正在使用可能迅速
about more people are using swift maybe

151
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,814
这是真的我不知道，但是你
it's true i don't know but so that you

152
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:16,154
知道他们真的会说的是
know they're gonna they really said is

153
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,685
他们对swift和。更熟悉
they're more familiar with swift and

154
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,515
如果我是的话，你知道的朱莉娅
julia which you know if i if I were

155
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,685
说我会说我比我更熟悉
speaking I'd say I'm more familiar than

156
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,414
朱莉娅比斯威夫特所以也许这是公平的
Julia than Swift so maybe it's fair and

157
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,205
然后我开始放一点卡通片
then I started to put a little cartoon

158
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,435
关于编程心理学
on the psychology of programming

159
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,024
语言只是因为它的类型
languages just because it's it's sort of

160
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,125
我和所有人碰到的东西
a something that I bump into with all

161
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,705
人们总是说所有语言的时间
the time people always say all languages

162
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,904
同样好，它不是真的
are equally good it doesn't really

163
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,754
但事实是，如果你不这样做
matter but the truth is if you don't

164
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,194
如果提到一个，请提一种语言
mention a language if you mention a

165
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,395
你尚未使用的语言
language that you're not using yet

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,274
你至少要把它调出来
you're gonna tune it out at least until

167
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,795
谷歌出现就是这样
Google comes along so that that's where

168
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,705
我们还好，我就这么说
we are okay enough about I just put this

169
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,164
我知道在你身边测试它
together I know testing it out on you

170
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,455
现在好了，现在让我这样做两个
all right now so now let me do so two

171
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,334
更多的数学事物，所以第一
more mathematical things so the first

172
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,844
我想做的事情是和你谈谈
thing I want to do is talk to you about

173
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,564
前进模式自动
forward mode automatic

174
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:03,944
分化所以，如果你做了任何
differentiation so if you've done any

175
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,834
自动折旧当然可以
automatic depreciation of course okay so

176
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,754
我觉得这很有趣，我希望你能
I think this is pretty fun I hope you'll

177
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,355
喜欢它
like it

178
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,295
我有一个笔记本，朱莉娅向前跑
I have a notebook and Julia run forward

179
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,765
模式自动分化和
mode automatic differentiation and the

180
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,295
这个笔记本因为我而走到一起
this notebook came together because I

181
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,394
我试图了解什么是大事
was trying to understand what the big

182
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,825
交易是很长一段时间，我有一个
deal was for a long time and and I had a

183
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,355
小麻烦我的意思是它就是这个
little trouble I mean it's it's the

184
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,825
通常的故事，我们是逐行的
usual story we're on a line-by-line

185
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,434
水平它很容易理解，但喜欢
level it's easy to understand but like

186
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,964
这是什么大不了的一部分
what's the big deal part that's that

187
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,674
有时候更难掌握和
sometimes the harder thing to grasp and

188
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,444
和我要去的第一本笔记本
and and the first notebook I'm gonna

189
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,224
告诉你是我的结果
show you is sort of the result of my

190
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,114
试图抓住那样的东西
trying to grasp like what was the the

191
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:41,504
这里的真实照片和我的第二件事
real picture here and the second thing I

192
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:42,494
我想我会在黑板上做
think I'll just do on the blackboard

193
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:43,904
它还没有真正准备好，但我会
it's not even really ready yet but I'll

194
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,884
无论如何，它会释放给你们
sort of unleash it on you folks anyway

195
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,575
是告诉你如何做一个特定的
is to show you how to do a particular

196
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,765
自动向后模式的示例
example of backward mode automatically

197
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,325
反向传播的发音
pronounciation the backpropagation let

198
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,764
你在神经网络和II猜测中看到了
you see in a neural net and I I guess

199
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,114
你已经看到了一些自己的东西
you have seen some their own that's here

200
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:59,054
实际上他们现在可能是每个人的
so actually they might now everybody's

201
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,274
看到神经网我觉得你知道两个
seen neural nets I think you know two

202
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,384
从现在起几年，它将处于高度低点
years from now it'll be in height low

203
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:03,735
高中和那里三年
high schools and three years from there

204
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,844
将在幼儿园我不知道
will be in kindergartens I don't know

205
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,795
每个人都看到神经网似乎是
everybody see neural nets seem to be

206
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,534
那种他们并不难
sort of they're not that hard to

207
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,194
明白没关系，让我开始吧
understand okay so let me let me start

208
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,494
关闭的事情，真的是两件事
things off and really the two things

209
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:17,944
我要说服你的是
that I'd left to convince you of is

210
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,474
让我在这里找到我的订单
let's let me just find here's my ordered

211
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,204
如果事情是我真的两件事
if thing the two things that I really

212
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,605
想要说服你，也许你
want to convince you of and maybe you

213
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,394
已经相信其中一些是那个
already believe some of this is one that

214
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,414
好吧，也许你还不相信这一点
well maybe you don't believe this yet

215
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,055
但是语言很重要
but that the language matters in a

216
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,904
正确的数学意义
mathematical sense that the right the

217
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,694
正确的计算机语言可以做到
right the right computer language can do

218
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,184
更多的是为你而不仅仅是采取一些
more for you than just take some

219
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,865
黑板上的算法和实现
algorithm on a blackboard and implement

220
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,785
它可以做到它可以做更多
it you could do it could do much more

221
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,004
这是我希望的
and this is something that that I hope

222
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,795
举几个例子和另一个例子
to give a few examples of and the other

223
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,985
我打赌你们都相信的事情
thing that I bet you all are believed

224
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,285
现在因为你已经上过这堂课了
now because you've been in this class is

225
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,535
那是线性代数的基础
that that linear algebra is the basis

226
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,305
一切每门课程应该开始
for everything every course should start

227
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,764
线性代数我的意思是它
with linear algebra I mean that's it to

228
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,865
我感觉这是一次不幸的事故
me it feels like a unfortunate accident

229
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,745
那个线性代数来的历史
of history that that linear algebra came

230
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,415
由于太多原因等等太晚了
too late for too many reasons and and so

231
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,505
经常会有更好的事情
very often things that would be better

232
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,915
与线性代数做得都
done with linear algebra are

233
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,465
不，而且我的意思是，如果对我来说
not and and and I mean it if to me it

234
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,574
感觉就像没有做物理
feels like doing physics without

235
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,045
微积分就像我只是不明白
calculus like I just don't get it

236
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,514
就像我知道高中那样做但是它
like I know high schools do that but it

237
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,375
只是看起来不对，你知道我喜欢
just seems wrong you know it to me like

238
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,595
你知道所有的工程
you know all of engineering all it

239
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,245
应该都是线性代数我的意思是我
should all be linear algebra I mean I'm

240
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,584
我只相信几乎所有可能都没有
I just believe that almost all maybe not

241
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:32,774
所有，但比大多数颇多
all but quite a lot more than most

242
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,894
人们意识到我会说好的，所以让
people realize I would say okay so let

243
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,625
我从自动差异开始
me start with automatic differentiation

244
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,565
所以我要从这个故事开始
so so I'm gonna start by this story by

245
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,574
告诉你我会去
telling you that I would go to

246
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:44,985
会议我会去数字
conferences I would go to numerical

247
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,905
分析会议我会听到人们的意见
analysis conferences I would hear people

248
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,035
谈论自动分化我是
talk about automatic differentiation I'm

249
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,384
说实话，我正在看我的电子邮件
gonna be honest I was reading my email I

250
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,824
进行了调整出像谁在乎像
was tuned out like who cares about like

251
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,074
我知道微积分我可以教
I know calculus I could you could teach

252
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:56,024
一台电脑，我不知道我是谁
a computer to do it I don't you know I'm

253
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,975
对我来说似乎很容易，我的意思是我确定
seems pretty easy to me I mean I'm sure

254
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,235
有技术细节，但它
there are technical details but it

255
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,215
教一个人似乎并不那么有趣
didn't seem that interesting to teach a

256
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,795
计算机区分我有点
computer to differentiate I sort of

257
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,175
认为它是相同的微积分
figured that it was the same calculus

258
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,735
我在学习微积分时学到了什么
that I learned when I took a calculus

259
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,535
你知道的课，你知道你
class you know here you know you you've

260
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,065
记住这张桌子，你教给它一个
memorized this table you teach it to a

261
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,985
电脑，你知道你学习链
computer you know you learn the chain

262
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,305
规则和产品规则和
rule and the product rule and the

263
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,134
商数规则并且你碰到了你
quotient rule and bump you you did the

264
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:16,694
电脑正在做我想做的事
computer is doing just what I would do

265
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,035
它用纸和铅笔这么重要我
it with paper and pencil so a big deal I

266
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,135
是不是我没注意到任何一个
was I didn't pay attention and in any

267
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,665
事件有说有点有
event there was said a little there was

268
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,834
这个小神经元在我的背后
this little neuron in the back of my

269
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,485
大脑说嘿，也许我错了
brain that said hey maybe I'm wrong

270
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,225
也许它正在做有限的差异你
maybe it's doing finite differences you

271
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,755
知道你采取的那种事情
know the sort of thing where you take

272
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,295
你把dy-by-dx带入了
the the the you take the d-y-by-dx in

273
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,855
一些数字方式，你做的
some numerical way it's you do the

274
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,855
有限差异和激进
finite differences and in the radical

275
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,175
分析他们应该告诉你
analysis they're supposed to tell you

276
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,435
你知道如果你的H太大了吗？
you know if H is too big you get

277
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,785
如果你有一件T太截断误差
truncation error if you have a t too

278
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,465
小你得到了舍入错误和
small you get roundoff error and the

279
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,845
真相是没有人告诉过你是什么
truth is nobody ever tells you what's a

280
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,764
好年龄，但你去数字
good age but you go to numerical

281
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,505
分析课希望有人会
analysis class hoping somebody would

282
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,875
告诉你，但无论如何，所以我
tell you but but in any event so I

283
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,925
想也许就是这样的
thought maybe it was that kind of a

284
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,495
数值有限差分和和
numerical finite difference and and and

285
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,565
我认为对我来说最大的惊喜是
and I think the big surprise for me was

286
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,084
自动分化是
that automatic differentiation was

287
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:01,365
既不是第一件事，也不是第二件事
neither the first nor the second thing

288
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,985
实际上还有第三件事
that there's actually a third thing

289
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,975
有些不同
something different

290
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,954
那不是第一个或第二个
that's neither the first or the second

291
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,564
我发现那令人着迷和
that I found that fascinating and and

292
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,415
也许我甚至会告诉你它是如何击中的
maybe I'll even tell you how how it hit

293
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,824
我知道这就是故事
me in the head that this was the story

294
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,774
因为我真的没有注意
because I really wasn't paying attention

295
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,465
但我喜欢这种奇异的价值
but I loved the singular value

296
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,024
分解我很高兴看到这一点
decomposition I'm glad to see that

297
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,785
人们正在绘制抛物线和四分之一
people are drawing parabolas and quarter

298
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,255
圆和搞清楚什么的
circles and figuring out what the the

299
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,524
这个东西是最小的SVD值
minimum SVD value is this thing right is

300
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,875
只是你知道的
is just you know the

301
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,855
只是你知道上帝给人类的礼物
it's justyou know God's gift to mankind

302
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,204
它只是一个很好的分解和一个
it's just a good factorization and one

303
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,514
我会玩的东西
of the things that I would I was playing

304
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,855
与朱莉娅一起计算
with with with Julia was to calculate

305
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,574
SVD的雅可比矩阵也是如此
the the Jacobian matrix for the SVD so

306
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,574
所以你知道所有的矩阵因子分解
so you know all matrix factorizations

307
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,314
只是改变变量就是这样
are just changes of variables right so

308
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,144
如果你有一个正方形的话
if you have an if you have a square

309
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,175
矩阵n由SVD宝贝我确定你
matrix n by n the SVD babe I'm sure you

310
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,365
知道这是你知道的U矩阵
know this is you know the the U matrix

311
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,074
实际上是n倍n减去1比2
is really n times n minus one over two

312
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,384
变量也是V和Sigma所具有的
variables so is the V and the Sigma has

313
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,334
有n个变量把它们放在一起
got n variables put it all together you

314
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:03,345
N平方所以它只是一个变化
got N squared so it's just a change of

315
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,574
变量和每次改变
variables and every time you change

316
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,574
变量你可以形成那个大矩阵n
variables you can form that big matrix n

317
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,704
你知道N平方的平方
squared by N squared of the you know

318
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,215
dy/dx计算其决定因素并得到
dy/dx compute its determinants and get

319
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,595
答案，我想让你知道
an answer and and I want you to know

320
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,004
我真想知道的是什么
what that I wanted to actually knew the

321
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,745
对于和我想的理论回答
theoretical answer for that and I wanted

322
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,754
看电脑确认一下
to see a computer confirm that

323
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,965
理论答案和我谈到了一些
theoretical answer and I spoke to some

324
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,365
在非非洲写过奥托蒂芬的人
people who who wrote Otto Tiffin in non

325
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,615
giulia语言和我很惊讶
giulia languages and I was surprised by

326
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,134
答案他们说哦，是的，我们可以
the answer they said oh yeah we could

327
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:32,595
教我们系统的答案我说
teach the answer to our system I said

328
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,704
你是什么意思，你可以教导
what do you mean you could teach the

329
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:34,905
回答为什么不只是计算
answer why doesn't just compute the

330
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,285
回答你要教的答案
answer what you have to teach the answer

331
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,834
我认为那是错的，因为在
I thought that was all wrong because in

332
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,215
朱莉娅，我们没有必要教它
Julia we didn't have to teach it it

333
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,014
实际上它实际上会计算它
actually it would actually calculate it

334
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,264
哦，然后我开始明白了
oh and then I started to understand a

335
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,615
更多关于auto-da-fé的内容
little bit more about what auto-da-fé

336
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,235
正在做和朱莉娅正在做的事情
was doing and what Julia was doing and

337
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,305
所以这就是这款笔记本的样子
so this is how this notebook came to be

338
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,215
所以，让我开始，我说太多了
so let me start I'm saying too much let

339
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,254
我从一个可能的例子开始
me start with an example that that might

340
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,285
有点打击家，所以我要去计算
kind of hit home so I'm going to compute

341
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,084
x的平方根我真的很简单
the square root of x I'm a real simple

342
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:00,405
例如你知道平方根很漂亮
example you know square roots pretty

343
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,295
我最老的时候会很容易的
easy I'm gonna take when the oldest

344
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,824
人类已知的算法
algorithms known to mankind

345
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:05,985
巴比伦人的平方根算法吧
the Babylonians square root algorithm it

346
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,184
说你知道从一个开始开始
says you know start with a starting

347
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:09,254
猜猜可能它有点太低了
guess T maybe it's a little bit too low

348
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,684
对于x的平方根，得到x超过T所以
for the square root of x get x over T so

349
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,665
这将是太大继续前进，
that would be too large go ahead and

350
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,824
取平均值，并重复没关系，这是
take the average and repeat okay this is

351
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,144
相当于牛顿的方法
equivalent to a Newton's method for

352
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,725
求平方根，你知道这是
taking the square root and you know it's

353
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,975
已经知道了几千年人类如此
been known for millennia to mankind so

354
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,824
你不知道它不是非常糟糕
it's not a terribly you know it's not

355
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:26,925
无论如何最新的研究
the latest research by any means for

356
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,134
计算平方根，但它的工作原理
computing square roots but it it works

357
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,805
非常有效，这里有点
very effectively and here's a little

358
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,225
Julia代码实际上会很好
Julia code that actually will well will

359
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,785
实现它可能看起来像代码
implement it it probably looks like code

360
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,634
用任何语言，所以我要开始
in any language so I'm gonna start off

361
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,075
一个人
at one so

362
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,145
从字面上看，我只需要一个加号
literally I'm just gonna take one plus

363
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,115
起始值X除以2
the starting value X and divide by two

364
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,265
然后我会重复好的，你
and then I'm gonna repeat okay and you

365
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,305
你知道我们可以，我们可以检查
know you can we we can check that the

366
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,185
算法在这里工作的alphasPI等
algorithm works here's alphas PI and so

367
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,865
我将采用巴比伦算法和
I'll take the Babylonian algorithm and

368
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,395
将它与朱莉的内置和你比较
compare it to Julie's built-in and you

369
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,545
看到它给这里给出了正确的答案
see it gives gives the right answer here

370
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,075
它是你知道的两个平方根
it is with square root of two you know

371
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,455
总是很好检查你的代码
always good to check your your code

372
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,925
工作还好，即使我喜欢看东西
works okay even I like to see things

373
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,305
图形所以我跑了算法
graphically so I ran the algorithm for

374
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,075
很多X值，你甚至可以
lots of values of X and you could even I

375
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,985
喜欢做这个，我有种想，在
love doing this I kind of wished that in

376
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,995
前面讲我这是什么，如果
the previous talk I was this is what if

377
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,675
我只工作速度不够快我
I'd only worked fast enough I was

378
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,965
实际上我去建了一个粘糊糊的
actually I went to build a little gooey

379
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,495
我可以在哪里移动点数
where I could move the points and in

380
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,205
你眼前，也许你有一个在
front of your eyes maybe you have one in

381
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,335
MATLAB我打赌你这样做，但我想
MATLAB I bet you do but I wanted to

382
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,595
建立它，但他们没有快速到达那里
build it but they didn't get there fast

383
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,565
不够好，但在这里，这是一个诸如此类的事情
enough but here this is a sort of thing

384
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,185
我想看到我收敛
and I'd like to see the convergence I

385
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,295
意思是所以你可以看到数字
mean so you could see the digits

386
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,815
将抛物线收敛于
converging the the the parabola on the

387
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,225
底部黑色是的平方根
bottom the black is the square root of

388
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,505
当然所以它就是这样的
course so there it is there's the

389
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,625
我想得到的巴比伦算法
Babylonian algorithm I would like to get

390
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,475
平方根的导数但是
the derivative of square root but the

391
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,665
游戏规则是我不会去的
rules of the game are I'm not going to

392
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,675
类型方法一或方法二我不是
type method one or method two I'm not

393
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,325
去做你永远不会看到我输入1/2
going to do you'll never see me type 1/2

394
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,035
X到负1/2，这对你来说都是正确的
X to the minus 1/2 that's right you all

395
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,775
知道这是我不会的衍生物
know that's the derivative I will not

396
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,605
打字，我不会，它不会来
type that I will not it's not gonna come

397
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,705
Juliaok和第二个
anywhere from Julia ok and the second

398
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,815
事情是我不会做有限的事情
thing is I'm not gonna do a finite

399
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,915
区别我会没事拿到
difference all right I'm gonna get that

400
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,375
平方根，但不是通过某种方式
square root but not by by by sort of

401
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,145
要么是我确定你的两件事
either the two things that I'm sure you

402
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,085
会想到没问题但是这是怎么回事
would think of alright but here's how

403
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,185
我要去做，而且我要去做
I'm gonna do it and and I'm gonna do a

404
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,355
朱莉娅码点点就会有
little bit of Julia code there'll be

405
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,675
八条朱莉娅，但我不会
eight lines of Julia but I'm not gonna

406
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,145
完全说它是如何工作的我会
completely say how it works yet I'll

407
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,275
也许我会让你陷入悬念
I'll keep you in suspense for maybe

408
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,625
大约五分钟，然后我会说
about five minutes and then I'll tell

409
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,765
你是如何工作的
you how it how it works

410
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,255
好吧所以这里有八行朱莉娅
all right so here's eight lines of Julia

411
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,925
代码，这将得到平方根
code that will get me the square root so

412
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,445
在这三行中，我要创造一个
in these three lines I'm gonna create a

413
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,525
朱莉娅类型我要把它称为d4
julia type i'm gonna call it a d4 for a

414
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,955
双数这是去一个名字
dual number which is a name that goes

415
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,375
回到至少一个世纪或许更多
back at least a century maybe more so

416
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,985
我要创建一个d型和所有这些
i'm gonna create a d type and all this

417
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,065
是一对漂浮物好吧所以它是一个
is is a pair of floats okay so um it's a

418
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,775
它会带有一对花车的元组
tuple with a pair of floats it's gonna

419
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,545
可这将是某种
be it's going to be some sort of

420
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,375
数值函数和导数对
numerical function and derivative pair

421
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,805
好吧，我的八条线中有三条是
all right so three of my eight lines is

422
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,605
创造一个d--这意味着享受你的
to create a d-- this means enjoy your

423
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,174
语言
language

424
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,424
这意味着使用数字的子类型
this means to use a subtype of a number

425
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,624
所以我们会把它当成一个数字
so we're gonna treat it like a number

426
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,664
对，我们希望能够增加倍数
right we want to be able to add multiply

427
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,514
并划分这些有序的对，但
and divide these these ordered pairs but

428
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,284
它只是一对数字而不是
it's just a pair of numbers right don't

429
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,144
得到-不要朱莉娅吓唬你，只是
get--don't the Julia scare you it's just

430
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,584
函数导数数字对
a function derivative numerical pair

431
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,014
好吧，这些其他五行是什么
okay and what's these other five lines

432
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,684
好吧，我想教它一些规则
well I want to teach it to some rule in

433
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:17,594
商数规则让大家记住
the quotient rule so you all remember

434
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,244
总和规则我猜这很容易
the sum rule I guess that's the easy one

435
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,704
该商数规则仍然还是有
the quotient rule is still I still have

436
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,504
你知道我高中的老师
the my teacher from high school you know

437
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:24,914
你知道，在我耳后响起
ringing in the back of my ear you know

438
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,024
分母时候，它是
the denominator times it was the

439
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,434
分子减去你所有的分子
numerator minus the numerator you all

440
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:28,544
有顺口溜和你的工作你
have that jingle and you're working your

441
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:30,524
大脑过于我打赌你被划分
brain too I bet you do divided by the

442
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:31,484
分母平方
denominator squared

443
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:35,024
甚至不能把它弄出来我的头，以便最大
can't even get it out of my head so up

444
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,524
所以有商数规则等等
so so there's the quotient rule and so

445
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:40,664
我们在这五行中做了什么
what are we doing in these five lines

446
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:44,054
首先，我想超载
well first of all I want to overload

447
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:45,734
加分和其他一些东西
plus and divide and a few other things

448
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,884
朱莉娅要我说你确定吗
and Julia wants me to say are you sure

449
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,744
所以你说的方式是肯定的
so the way you say are you sure is that

450
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,664
我要进口加分并除以你
I'm going to import plus and divide you

451
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:53,834
知道，因为这是危险的
know because it'd be dangerous to play

452
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,954
加上所以我在这里加两个
with plus so here I'm gonna the plus two

453
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,394
双数字我们要添加
dual numbers we're gonna add the

454
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,284
功能和衍生物分为两个
function and the derivatives divide two

455
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,874
双重数字，我们将分裂
dual numbers we're gonna divide the

456
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,764
函数值和分母时间
function values and denominator times

457
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:05,204
分子等等，但你明白了
the numerator blah blah but you get it

458
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,314
好吧，八条线中有六条线
okay that's six of the eight lines the

459
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,105
第七行是我有双号
seventh line is if I have a dual number

460
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,174
我想转换它，你知道如何
I wanted to to convert it you know how

461
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:15,345
就像轮子嵌入了
like the wheels are embedded in the

462
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,294
复杂是你知道你只是我们必须
complex is you know you just we have to

463
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,995
告诉朱莉娅拿一个双号和
tell Julia to to take a dual number and

464
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,274
在坚持一个零，然后再双
stick a zero in in and then then dual

465
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,985
数字和常规数字可以完成
numbers and regular numbers can complete

466
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,654
很好地在一起，这实际上
nicely together and this this actually

467
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,935
如果我是真的说的话
is the thing that actually says if I

468
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,134
在一个数字中有一个双号
have a dual number in a number in

469
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:32,174
操作推动他们这样的工作为
operation promote them so the work as

470
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,835
双号码所以八行的代码，以便
dual numbers so eight lines of code so

471
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,325
我要告诉你的第一件事就是
the first thing I'm gonna tell you is

472
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,455
我要提醒你，你永远不会知道我
I'm going to remind you you never know I

473
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,044
从来没有输入一半X到负1/2
never typed one-half X to the minus 1/2

474
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,475
你不同意我没有进口的人吗？
do you agree no one I'm not importing

475
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,884
任何包装都不会像它来的那样
any packages it's not like it's coming

476
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,565
从我不是偷偷摸摸的
in from the I'm not sneaking it in from

477
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:47,924
旁边
the side

478
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,935
减去一个房子没有1/2X.
there's no 1/2 X to the minus a house

479
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,095
当然没有任何数字
and there's certainly not any numerical

480
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,345
衍生品或者恰到好处
derivatives either right just the just

481
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,534
可以说是几乎感觉到的规则
just arguably a rule that almost feels

482
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,884
符号中的商数规则
symbolic the quotient rule in the

483
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,715
添加规则，但没有数字
addition rule but but no numerical

484
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,065
这里的有限差异还可以
finite differences at all here okay so

485
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,225
所以首先让我告诉你
so first of all let me show you here

486
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,655
我正在接受我的申请
that I'm taking the I'm applying the

487
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,275
没有重写的巴比伦算法
Babylonian algorithm without rewriting

488
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,855
在我们之前的代码到双号
code to a dual number now before we

489
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,205
将它应用于数字，但现在我要去了
applied it to numbers but now I'm gonna

490
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,315
将它应用于这个双重数字
apply it to this dual number they're

491
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,225
刚发明我将在49岁时申请
just invented I'm gonna apply it at 49

492
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,565
一个因为我知道答案，然后我就是
one cuz I know the answer and then I'm

493
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,545
要把它与我拿一个进行比较
gonna compare it with I'm taking one

494
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,495
x的平方根的一半只是为了
half of a square root of x just for

495
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,385
比较目的是正确而非不是
comparison purposes right and not not in

496
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,185
我自己的算法，当然你看到了
my own algorithm and of course you see

497
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,525
我正在神奇地做对了
that I'm getting magically the right

498
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,225
没有任何答案你应该好奇
answer without ever so you should wonder

499
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,785
我怎么做的我是怎么得到的
how did I do that how did I get the

500
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,525
衍生品，我们可以采取任何数字你
derivative we could take any number you

501
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,015
如果您愿意的话，就像这里的一百个
like here's a hundred if you prefer to

502
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,355
看到一个像pi这样的数字我们可以做到这一点
see a number like pi we can do that I

503
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,685
意思是你知道我们可以做到这一切
mean you know we can do it every like

504
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,245
它会起作用所以你看到了
it's going to work so there you see that

505
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,045
这是pi和此的平方根
this is the square root of pi and this

506
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,335
将是一个一半以上的平方根
would be one half over the square root

507
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,345
pi数字，所以你看到它
of pi numerically so and you see it

508
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,135
将这些数字与这些数字相匹配
matches these these numbers to enough

509
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,695
实际上所有数字都是数字
digits in fact all the digits actually

510
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,395
是的，所以这件事神奇地工作好了
yeah so this thing magically worked okay

511
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,625
你应该都在想这是怎么回事
you should all be wondering how did that

512
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,135
发生
happen

513
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,375
对，我没有重写任何代码我
right I didn't rewrite any code I

514
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,905
实际上写了一个代码来计算一个
actually wrote a code to just compute a

515
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,705
平方根我从来没有写过
square root I never could never wrote a

516
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,325
用于计算平方导数的代码
code to compute the derivative of square

517
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,635
根源和顺便说一下这是一个
roots and and by the way this is a

518
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,675
那一点点朱莉娅的魔力
little bit of the Julia magic that that

519
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,985
我们正在推动数字是非常
we're pushing numerically that very

520
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,895
经常在这个世界上人们会
often and in this world people will

521
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,395
写一个代码来做某事然后如果
write a code to do something and then if

522
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,565
你想做更像get的事情
you wanted to do something more like get

523
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,945
有人写另一个的衍生物
a derivative somebody writes another

524
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,395
与朱莉娅的代码经常可以
code with Julia very often you can

525
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,375
实际上保持原始代码如果
actually keep to the original code if

526
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,815
你只需要使用它和正常
you just use it properly and

527
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,885
聪明地你可以做神奇的事情
intelligently you can do magic things

528
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,805
没有编写新代码，你会看到
without writing new codes and you'll see

529
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,325
这又是一点点但是这里
this again in a little bit but here's

530
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,575
你的衍生物知道这是
the derivative of you know this this is

531
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,165
的x的平方根的1/2的情节
the plot of 1/2 of the square root of x

532
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,175
在黑色，你可以看到
in black and again you could see the

533
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,725
在这里好好收敛我好
convergence over here all right well I'm

534
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,735
仍然不会告诉你为什么它的工作原理
still not going to show you why it works

535
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,265
只是还没有我保证我会和它的
just yet I promise I will and it's

536
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,255
可能还要多几分钟但是
probably a few more minutes more but

537
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,055
我首先要做的是我想
what I will do first is is I'd like to

538
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,555
向你展示大多数人的东西
show you something that most people

539
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,385
不要看我从不看它我
don't ever look at I never look at it I

540
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,035
想展示你在这里是相同的
want to show you here's the same

541
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,125
巴比伦代码我想告诉你
Babylonian code I want to show you the

542
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,275
用于计算的汇编程序
assembler for the computation of the

543
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,315
派生所以我要经营巴比伦人
derivative so I'm gonna run Babylonian

544
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,005
在双重数字上，我们会
on a dual dual number and we're gonna

545
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,275
看这里，我不知道是否有人
look here and I don't know if anybody

546
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,745
这里读取汇编程序我打赌有
here reads assembler I'm betting there's

547
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,695
实际上是零或一个人
zero or one of you actually

548
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,865
读了这些东西你们有多少人读过
reads this stuff how many of you read

549
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,125
汇编程序好吧我们得到它不是0-1
assembler okay we have got it wasn't 0-1

550
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,895
我们有一半是他的一半
we had a half right there's a half he's

551
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,425
有点像这样的箭头
kind of going like this here's the arrow

552
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,375
这是他喜欢的一个好吗
here's one he's like this okay

553
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,355
所以我认为零的是正确的
so so I think zero ones like the right

554
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,025
有点但我敢打赌，如果我，你会相信我
bit but I'll bet you'll believe me if I

555
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,575
告诉你，当你有短
tell you that when you have short

556
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,195
这样的汇编程序并不是很好
assembler like this and it's not very

557
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,445
很久以后你就拥有了高效的代码
long then you have efficient code but

558
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,215
它非常紧，它运行速度非常快
it's very tight it'll run very fast

559
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,955
所以不管这件事是做什么的
so whatever this thing is doing it's

560
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,385
简而言之，你不会得到任何
short and this you won't get from any

561
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,145
其他语言如果你确实尝试过
other language if you did try to do the

562
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,525
Python中我也向你保证
same thing in Python I promise you

563
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,175
他们将成为屏幕和屏幕
they'll be screens and screens and

564
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,005
即使你，屏幕也很丰富
screens full of stuff if even if you

565
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,805
能得到它所以这就是巴比伦人
could get it so so here's the Babylonian

566
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,565
双数的算法就在这里
algorithm on the dual number and here it

567
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,845
是一个汇编程序，它很短，所以
is an assembler and it's short so so the

568
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,195
我说的另一件事不仅仅是
other thing I'm saying is not only does

569
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,995
它有效，但朱莉也成功了
it work but Julie also makes it

570
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,115
在我终于告诉你之前，这样有效率
efficient so before I finally tell you

571
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,875
真正发生了什么以及它为何起作用
what's really going on and why it works

572
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,035
我要抓一个Python符号包
I'm gonna grab a Python symbolic package

573
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,395
这将与朱莉娅和
which will work nicely with Julia and

574
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,685
我将通过运行相同的代码
I'm going to run the same code through

575
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,865
Python象征性，并告诉你什么
the Python symbolic and show you what

576
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,575
这些是你的迭代
the these are the iterations that you

577
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,705
得到这是一个Khaleesi的
get so this is a Khaleesi the the

578
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,655
迭代朝向平方根和
iterations towards the square root and

579
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,705
这是迭代的
here are the iterations of the

580
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,905
实际存在的衍生物
derivative that's actually being

581
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,085
计算得到的，这里的关键点是
calculated um and the key point here is

582
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,785
当然，我们不是这个象征性的
of course we're not this is a symbolic

583
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,525
计算我们没有做一个象征性的
computation we're not doing a symbolic

584
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,295
计算这是数学上的
computation this is mathematically

585
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,755
相当于我们得到的功能
equivalent to the function we would get

586
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,855
如果我们喜欢绘制它或什么的
if we were to like plot it or something

587
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,715
但当然我们不是象征性的
but of course we're not symbolic

588
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,725
我的意思是计算效率非常低
computation is very inefficient I mean

589
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,375
你得到这些大系数我的意思
you get these big coefficients I mean

590
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,325
看看这个号码是什么这五
look at this number what is this five

591
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,425
无论如何，你得到的是万元
million or something anyway you get

592
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,615
这些人甚至是这些大数字
these big numbers these people even

593
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,905
这里更大的数字看这些巨大的
bigger numbers here look at these huge

594
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,035
数字正确，它需要很多
numbers right the it takes a lot of

595
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,615
存储我正在拖动这些X.
storage I'm dragging these X's along

596
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,865
记忆力有很大的拖累我的意思是这个
there's a big drag on memory I mean this

597
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,905
不是办法，这就是为什么我们做的
is not the way that this is why we do

598
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,455
数值计算但是什么
numerical computation but what the

599
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,015
巴比伦算法在没有
Babylonian algorithm in the absence of

600
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,405
任何舍入都等同于计算
any roundoff is equivalent to computing

601
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,995
你知道它正在计算的线上面
you know above the line it's computing

602
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,455
平方根在这里，然后在这里
the square root here and then below here

603
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,315
这是这些都是对迭代
this is these are the iterates towards

604
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,845
导数所以它实际上并非如此
the derivative so it's not actually

605
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:32,175
将X1/2X计算为负1/2
calculating X 1/2 X to the minus 1/2

606
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,735
它实际上在做一些迭代的事情
it's actually doing something iterative

607
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,735
差不多是1/2
that is approximating 1/2

608
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,405
-好吧，让我现在告诉你
- all right well let me tell you now let

609
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,985
我有点揭示正在发生的事情
me sort of reveal what's going on just

610
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,174
所以我可以告诉你它是怎么回事
so that I can kind of show you how it's

611
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,665
得到答案，就像我说的那样
getting the answer and like I said it

612
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,945
是SVD那种说服我的
was the SVD that sort of convinced me

613
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,265
这是怎么发生的，因为SVD是
how this was happening cuz the SVD is

614
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,795
也像这样的迭代算法
also an iterative algorithm like this

615
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,565
巴比伦方根，但它是
Babylonian square root but but it's

616
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,885
更容易向您展示与之相关的观点
easier to show you the point with the

617
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,975
胡扯和平方根所以我要做
baloney and square root so I'm gonna do

618
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,265
我永远不想做的事情
something that I would never want to do

619
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,485
这是明确写出衍生物
which is explicitly write a derivative

620
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,005
巴比伦算法和我正在做的事情
Babylonian algorithm and what I'm doing

621
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,955
我要采用2x的衍生规格
is I'm gonna take the derivative spec 2x

622
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,135
我的代码的每一行，所以你知道如果
of every line of my code so you know if

623
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,665
每条偶数或奇数线我都不知道
every even or odd line I never know

624
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,275
什么是偶数或奇数，但是
what's even or odd anymore but the

625
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,955
原始代码行有一个flex
original line of code had one flex over

626
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,975
两个现在我要采取衍生物
two now I'm going to take the derivative

627
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,554
或者在这里获得1/2
or get 1/2 here

628
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,745
如果我拿这个代码我就有这行代码
I had this line of code if I take the

629
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,145
衍生物我会使用的
derivative I'll use the the the the

630
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,455
商数规则，这将是
quotient rule and this would be the

631
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,755
如果我运行这个代码我会是衍生的
derivative if I run this code what I'm

632
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,605
有效的做法是我只是善用
effectively doing is I'm just using good

633
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,554
旧的加时间和分裂没有
old plus and times and divide nothing

634
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,595
看上去没有平方根
fancy there's not a square root to be

635
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,775
看到但我正在做的是当我跑我的
seen but what I'm doing is as I run my

636
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,945
算法我也在运行我其实
algorithm I'm also running I'm actually

637
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,045
如果我这样计算衍生物的话
computing the derivative as I go so if I

638
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,395
有这种无限的算法
have this infinite algorithm it's going

639
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,285
收敛到平方根此
to converge to the square root this the

640
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,115
衍生算法将收敛于
derivative algorithm will converge to

641
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,785
平方根的衍生物，但
the derivative of the square roots but

642
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,215
我不是我没有使用其他任何东西
I'm not I'm not using anything other

643
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,915
比加减次数除以得分
than plus minus times and divide to make

644
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,495
如果你重写任何代码就会发生这种情况
that happen so if you rewrite any code

645
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,685
在任何情况下你都可以迭代任何代码
at all you could have any code iterative

646
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,665
有限的，如果你只是无所谓
finite it doesn't matter if you just

647
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,835
把衍生品带回你的
take the derivatives back to your

648
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,174
你的代码的每一行的变量，然后
variable of every line of your code then

649
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,845
你可以得到一个衍生品，就像我一样
you can get a derivative out and as I

650
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,525
说这不是象征性的衍生品
said it's not a symbolic derivative like

651
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,804
你知道所有的1801或其他什么
you know all of 1801 or whatever

652
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,215
无论我们在哪里教微积分这些天
wherever we teach calculus these days

653
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,405
它不是像数字导数那样的
and it's not a numerical derivative like

654
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,965
在你知道的数字课程中
in a numerical courses that you know the

655
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,174
18.3XYZ是不同的
18.3 a X Y Z's whatever it's a different

656
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,505
野兽它是它的使用
beast it's the it's it's using the the

657
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,965
在加法法则商法则
quotient rule in the addition rule at

658
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,715
的每一步得到的答案
every step of the way to get the answer

659
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,875
所以，你知道这是这个d-bob
so and you know here's this d-bob

660
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,105
学习算法，你可以看到它
learning algorithm you could see it

661
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,455
跑步，我会得到它给予权利
running and I'll get it gives the right

662
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,554
回答我必须先执行代码
answer I have to execute the code first

663
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,655
得到正确答案，但你看到了
to get the right answer but you see it

664
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,054
给它给出正确的答案好吧哦
gives it gives the right answer okay oh

665
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:45,975
我只是在伊斯坦布尔，我可以
I was just in Istanbul and I they could

666
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,255
挑战我做招牌我忘了
challenge me to do sign I forgot about

667
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,264
它仍然在苏玛我的笔记本
that it's still in the Summa notebook I

668
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,304
它在我工作的每个人面前
it in front of everybody it worked I got

669
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,244
一个cosign好，但让我通过所有
a cosign okay but let me pass all of

670
00:24:55,249 --> 00:25:00,224
那么那么让我回去告诉你
that so so so so let me go back and tell

671
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:03,104
那么这一切如何运作良好
you then how is this all working well

672
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,664
发生了什么让我们回到原点
what's happening let's go back to the

673
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,554
八行代码，现在也许你
eight lines of code and now maybe you

674
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,764
可以看到发生了什么事情
could see what's happening the where's

675
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,084
我的八行代码来自于
my eight lines of code from the very

676
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,334
一开始，我本可以看到
beginning and I could have watched the

677
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:14,445
时间我想告诉你这个
time I want to show you this one other

678
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,874
太有希望我会有足够的东西
thing too so hopefully I'll have enough

679
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:20,654
是时候这样做但是在这里让我们看看
time to do that but here let's see we

680
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,584
强大的大西洋代码在哪里
were mighty Atlantic code where are they

681
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,874
在这里，我们去你这里的事件
here we go you're here the events of

682
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:29,014
代码所以我正在做的不是
code so what I'm doing is instead of

683
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:31,664
通过获取所有代码来重写
rewriting all your code by taking the

684
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,374
以人的方式衍生出每一条线
derivative of every line the human way

685
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:36,074
我是说为什么不能用这个软件
I'm saying that why can't the software

686
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,874
只是以某种自动方式做到这一点
just do this in some automatic way and

687
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:38,624
这是自动的地方
this is where the automatic

688
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:40,994
分化进入旧的
differentiation comes in and in the old

689
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,315
所有的人在过去的日子
old days when people in all the

690
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,144
数字代码在Fortran那里
numerical code was in Fortran there

691
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:45,244
将是这些源到源
would be these source-to-source

692
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:47,494
实际输入的翻译
translators that would actually input

693
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:52,364
代码和代码的输出衍生物
code and output derivatives of code the

694
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:55,394
giulia方式更现代的方式是让
giulia way the more modern way is to let

695
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:57,104
JIT编译器就是这样做的
the JIT compiler kind of do that for you

696
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:59,804
所以在这里我需要它加分和
so here I need it plus and divide of

697
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,244
当然我想添加减号和
course I would want to add minus and

698
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:04,874
次，但你只需要添加一对夫妇
times but you just add a couple of

699
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:08,174
事情，然后撞你知道你
things and then bump the you know you

700
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:10,185
不必改写D巴比伦人
don't have to rewrite the D Babylonian

701
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,134
因为这种类型的巴比伦人
because the Babylonian with this type

702
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:15,315
我会为你做的工作好吗
will just will do the work for you okay

703
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,544
这就是善的魔力所在
and that's where the magic of a good

704
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,344
的软件都会有，所以你
piece of software will have it so you

705
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:19,784
不必写翻译你
don't have to write a translator you

706
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:23,924
没有手写的，你只要给
don't have to handwrite it you just give

707
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:25,514
一些规则，你让
sort of the rules and you let the

708
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,714
电脑做对了我的意思就是这样
computer do it right I mean that's what

709
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,124
计算机应该擅长和
computers are supposed to be good at and

710
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,315
这就是所有发生的事情
so that's that's what's happening all

711
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,884
对，这就是前进模式
right so that's that's forward mode

712
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:35,984
自动分化我有10个
automatic differentiation I've got 10

713
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:37,904
分钟往回走左右，但让我
minutes to go backwards so but let me

714
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:38,804
看看有没有人有
see if there's any anybody have any

715
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:41,144
关于这一点的问题，这是真的
questions about this this it's really

716
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,315
神奇的权利，但它非常棒
magic right but it's pretty wonderful

717
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,614
魔术和你知道我不知道
magic and and and you know I don't know

718
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:46,804
你听说过机器学习的内容
what you've heard about machine learning

719
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:49,544
但说实话
but to be honest

720
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:52,094
机器学习这些天就是它
machine learning these days it's it's

721
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:54,614
这是你知道忘记了
it's it's you know forgetting about

722
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:56,264
你是否知道人类将毫无用处
whether you know humans will be useless

723
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:57,945
我不相信，但是
which I don't believe by the way but but

724
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,924
关于机器的重要事情
the the the the big thing about machine

725
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:02,144
学习是真的只是一个大的
learning is that it's really just a big

726
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:04,125
一切都是正确的优化
optimization that's all it is right

727
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,395
你遇到的最小/最大问题
big minimum/maximum problem where you've

728
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,865
所有从微积分中知道你是什么
all known from calculus that what you

729
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,335
需要做的就是拿你知道的衍生物
need to do is take derivatives you know

730
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,765
将它们设置为零，你就知道了
set them to zero right you know in the

731
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,145
多元的情况下，这是一个梯度你
case of multivariate it's a gradient you

732
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,475
把它设置为零，所以真的这一切
set it to zero and so really all of this

733
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,815
机器学习所有的大故事和
machine learning all the big stories and

734
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,885
最终的一切都归结为一个
everything in the end comes down to a

735
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,505
自动微分是排序的
automatic differentiation is sort of

736
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,065
喜欢整体的主力
like the the workhorse of the whole

737
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,475
事情，所以如果我们可以有一个
thing and so if we could have a a

738
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,695
给你那个主力的语言
language that gives you that workhorse

739
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,705
以一种好的方式然后机器学习
in a good way then machine learning

740
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,745
这样做真的有点好处
really sort of benefits from that so so

741
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,575
我希望你们都能看到全局
I hope you all see the the big picture

742
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,825
机器学习真的来了
of machine learning it really does come

743
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,745
向下走衍生工具这
down to taking derivatives that that's

744
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,895
这就是你的结局
that's the end of that's how you

745
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,625
否则，优化任何快速问题
optimize any quick questions otherwise

746
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,095
我要转换主题，我要去
I'm gonna switch topics and I'm going to

747
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:52,815
移动到黑板是啊有一个
move to the blackboard yeah there's a

748
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,375
基本上让你去的技巧
trick that basically lets you go to

749
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,605
更高的订单是的，你基本上可以
higher orders yeah you can basically

750
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,935
使它成为两个第一顺序的组合
make it a combo of two first order

751
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,115
衍生物，所以是的，它可以做到
derivatives so yeah it can be done did

752
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:11,445
你有一个我们正在使用的问题
you have a question oh we're using for

753
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:22,005
使用类型所以这是最大的伎俩
using types so so it's the biggest trick

754
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,585
在世界上，这不是一件小事
in the world it's not this little thing

755
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,475
做一个类型来做你的想法
the idea of making a type to do what you

756
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,585
你有没有看到这个chroniker产品
did you see chroniker products in this

757
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:36,345
类没有什么好嗯，让我看看
class what no okay um let me see what

758
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,565
你会在这看到什么耶
what would you have seen in this yeah

759
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:42,044
你看到了三角形矩阵吗？
did you see tridiagonal matrices your

760
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,135
最喜欢的好，所以这里是一个
favorite okay so here so here's a

761
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,705
内置类型让我们说n是不是
built-in type let's say n is it doesn't

762
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,005
必须是四个我要创造一个
have to be four I'm gonna create a

763
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,065
Strang矩阵如果我拼写正确的话
Strang matrix if I could spell it right

764
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,435
它将是一个sim三角形
and it's going to be a sim tri diagonal

765
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,965
这是一种朱莉娅型，我们将创造
which is a julia type and we will create

766
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,725
N的两个x和n的n
two x ones of N and minus ones of n

767
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,385
减一，现在这里的类型我的意思是这个
minus one now here's a type I mean this

768
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,095
是内置的，但你可以创建
is built-in but you could have created

769
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,995
它本身也很容易，我不这样做
it yourself just as easily and I don't

770
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,924
喜欢打电话
like calling

771
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:19,575
这当然不是一个密集的矩阵
this it's certainly not a dense matrix

772
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,075
而且我不喜欢称之为稀疏
and I don't like calling it a sparse

773
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,205
矩阵我更喜欢称之为结构化
matrix I prefer to call it a structured

774
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,264
矩阵虽然稀疏这个词是一个
matrix though the word sparse it's a

775
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:28,244
这里有点棘手，但我之所以如此
little tricky here but the reason why I

776
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:29,764
不喜欢称之为稀疏矩阵
don't like to call this a sparse matrix

777
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:34,215
是因为我们没有存储索引
is because we're not storing indices in

778
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,264
任何我的意思是有很多想象力
any I mean there's a lot of fancy

779
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:37,364
存储指数的方案
schemes for storing indices for for

780
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,884
分数稀疏的矩阵很好
sparse matrices well the score store is

781
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:42,164
一个对角线矢量，这两个是
a diagonal vector there's the two's on

782
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:44,355
对角线有一个四向量
the diagonal there's a four vector with

783
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,534
四个二，这里是三个向量
four twos and here's a three vector for

784
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,274
对角线，你知道你没有
the off diagonal and you know you don't

785
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,075
以最稀疏的方式拥有它两次
have it twice by the way most sparse

786
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,355
矩阵结构会
matrix structures would would would

787
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,235
你会知道减去的吗？
would have you know the the minus ones

788
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,264
矢量两次超级和次级但
vector twice the super and the sub but

789
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,855
真的只有季度信息
really only the quarter information

790
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,174
这需要的是存储并在某种程度上一个
that's needed is stored and in a way one

791
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,494
在julia中使用的类型基本上就是你
uses types in julia to basically you

792
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,835
只存储你所需要的不是更多
only store what you need not more and

793
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,114
然后你定义你的运作
then you define your operations to work

794
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:18,644
所以，例如，如果我要带你
so for example if i were to take you

795
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:21,374
知道斯特朗逆时间如此
know Strang inverse time so anything

796
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:23,804
在这里是你知道的随机条款
with here's you know terms of random for

797
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,235
我会做一个线性的解决方案
I'm gonna do a linear solve you would

798
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,095
要使用特殊的回斯拉夫说
want to use a special back Slav that

799
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,955
知道矩阵是对称的
knew that the matrix was a symmetric

800
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,044
这是一个很重要的故事
tri-diagonal so it's a big story of

801
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:35,924
能够创建类型并使用它们
being able to create types and use them

802
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,195
为了你自己的目的，你不知道
for your own purposes without you know

803
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,315
任何浪费，这是一种事情
any wastage and this is a sort of thing

804
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,054
虽然你可以用语言来做
that while you can do it in languages

805
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,965
如果你是桌子，就像MATLAB中的Python一样
like Python in MATLAB if you were table

806
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,674
看看汇编程序和那个级别
look at the assembler and that level

807
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,235
永远不会让你呀
never let you Python you just would

808
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,815
后悔但是你会看到
regret it but you would you would see

809
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,605
这是多少开销
just how much overhead there is in doing

810
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,494
这样就没有性能提升
this so there'd be no performance gain

811
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:00,825
但在某种程度上，这就是你想要的
but in a way what this is what you want

812
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,965
做你想用这些东西来
to do you want to use these things to

813
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,994
匹配数学和所以那样
match the mathematics and and so that's

814
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,394
真的是能够做到的好事
really the nice thing to be able to do

815
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,534
没事我只有五分钟我
all right I only have five minutes I

816
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:09,975
不知道我是不是要把它拉下来
don't know if I'm gonna pull this off

817
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,804
但我会告诉我能不能给你
but I'll let me see if I could give you

818
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:14,894
在她的五分钟内的主要想法
the main idea in five minutes of her

819
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:16,845
沉浸式模式差异，但在这里
immersed mode differentiations but here

820
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,914
只要你熟悉神经
as long as you are familiar with neural

821
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,164
网络让我看看我是否能做到这一点
networks let me see if I can do this

822
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:23,325
我很快就会开始
very quickly I'm going to start with

823
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,114
scalars好吧我会做一个神经
scalars okay I'm gonna do a neural

824
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,575
所有标量的网络，但仅限于
network of all scalars but only for

825
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,924
简单的初学者，但我认为
simplicity for starters but I think

826
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,365
你会发现这可能是一般性的
you're gonna see that this can general

827
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,315
两个真实的向量和矩阵
two vectors and matrices which are real

828
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,625
神经网络，所以我要做的
neural networks so what I'm going to do

829
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,835
我想要想象我们有我们的
is I want to imagine that we have our

830
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,345
输入将有一堆标量
inputs will have a bunch of scalar

831
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,205
权重和偏见所以这里是w1和我
weights and biases so here's w1 and I'll

832
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,475
上升到W和B所以我们有一个
go up to W and B all right so we have a

833
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,685
一堆重量和偏见在这里没关系
bunch of weights and biases here okay

834
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:59,115
我们也将有一个x1
and we'll also have an x1 which will

835
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,635
排序开始我们的神经网络
sort of start off our neural network and

836
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,855
我们要计算我会写的
we're going to compute I'll write in

837
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,685
有点朱莉娅喜欢或MATLAB黑色
sort of Julia like or MATLAB black

838
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,905
I的符号等于1到n我会
notation for I equals 1 through n I will

839
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:17,295
通过我的一些功能来更新X.
update X by taking some function of my

840
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,595
当前输入可能是这样的
current input maybe something like this

841
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,905
什么功能H使用我不
and what function H to use I don't

842
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,304
在过去真的太在意了
really care too much in the old days

843
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:27,255
人们常常谈论乙状结肠
people used to talk about the sigmoid

844
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,715
现在的功能是最大值为0
function nowadays it's the maximum of 0

845
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,985
和T一直在使用它
and T that gets used all the time it's

846
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,855
得到了这个荒谬的名字
got this ridiculous name rel U which I I

847
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,835
无论如何他们真的受不了
really can't stand but anyway they

848
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,835
纠正线性单位但无论如何我
rectified linear unit but in any event I

849
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,815
意思是它只是一个功能
mean it it it's just a function that's

850
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,085
你知道的TT大于等于更大
you know T of T is greater than equal to

851
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:57,405
00，如果不是这样，但无论什么功能
0 0 if not so so but whatever function

852
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,825
你喜欢在这里我只是要
and you like and here I'm just gonna

853
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,375
最终你也可以更新Taemin
update Taemin ultimately you might also

854
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,645
有一些数据Y，你想
have some data Y and you would like to

855
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,115
如果一切都像我说的那样的标量
if everything is a scalar like I said

856
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,525
这可以很快推广
this could be generalized pretty quickly

857
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,845
但我们能做的就是尽量减少
but what we can do is we we can minimize

858
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:18,585
比如你知道的1/2Y减去XM平方
say 1/2 Y minus X M squared you know in

859
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,665
你想要找到的
the you're going to want to find the

860
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,645
数据可以最大限度地减少这一切
data that would minimize that ok all

861
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,625
这推广到矩阵和向量
this generalizes to matrices and vectors

862
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,495
这是大多数神经网络做得好的
which is what most neural nets do ok and

863
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,495
自从我不会有
since since since I'm not going to have

864
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,965
很多时候也许我可以只是有点
a lot of time maybe I can just sort of

865
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,395
如果我去的话，切入追逐
cut to the chase if I were to

866
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,995
区分我在这里的关键线
differentiate the key line here I've got

867
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,275
这里有一点朱莉娅，但如果我是
a little bit of Julia here but if I were

868
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,715
区分重点线会是什么
to differentiate the key line what would

869
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,905
我写道，我会在这里写得很好
I write I would write well here actually

870
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,044
让我用
let me use the

871
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:47,804
通常的记谱法让我有DeltaIB了
usual notation let me have Delta IB the

872
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,345
WXh的黄金我加双好了，这就是
H prime of WX i plus bi okay so that's

873
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,674
这是DeltaI然后你可以看到
that's Delta I and then you can see that

874
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,674
DXI加上一个是DeltaI，我会拥有
DX I plus one is Delta I and I'll have

875
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,374
DWIXI加DXIWI加dbi将是
DWI X I plus D X I WI plus d bi would be

876
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:12,975
差异这将是如何
the differential this would be how how

877
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,884
我几乎做到了这就是这样的善良
I'm almost done that's the goodness so

878
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,804
如果我做一点改变我喜欢
if I make a little change I like to

879
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,664
想到这就像点0:01的变化
think of this as like point 0:01 changes

880
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:21,525
我不喜欢我不喜欢无穷小
I don't like I don't like infinitesimal

881
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,114
一旦说到我的想法就像点O一样说
said like point O once it's how I think

882
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,614
他们但你做了一点改变
of them but you make a little change

883
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:25,695
这里有点变化
here a little change here a little

884
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,525
在这里改变你在这里得到改变
change here you get a change here you

885
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,185
你明白了，你知道你会得到这个
you'll get this you know you'll get this

886
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,035
线性的这个线性函数
linear this linear function of the

887
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,344
扰动在这里给你扰动
perturbations here gives you perturb

888
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,015
这里很好，我只有一个
ations here ok well I've only got one

889
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,304
分钟，所以我要写出这一切
minute so I'm gonna write all this out

890
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:41,834
用线性代数因为一切
with linear algebra because everything

891
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,185
用线性写出来更好
is better when written out with linear

892
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,955
代数所以我要写下我的意思
algebra so I'm gonna write down that I'm

893
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,624
要写下我实际上
gonna write down that I'm actually

894
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,765
对最后一个元素感兴趣但是dxdn
interested in the last element but dxd n

895
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,915
加1将是平等的，我会
plus 1 is going to equal and I'm gonna

896
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,625
这里有几个矩阵让我
have a couple of matrices here let me

897
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,255
只是让结构正确
just sort of get the structure right

898
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,074
这将是TX2DXn再加1
this will be T X 2 DX n plus 1 again

899
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,955
对不起压扁好吧但是
sorry for the squishing okay but and

900
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,205
这里其实我想用块
here in fact I'd like to use block

901
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,354
矩阵稍微如此，我会在这里
matrices a little bit so here I'm gonna

902
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,475
有DW1DB1我会放弃偏见
have DW 1 DB 1 I'm gonna put the bias

903
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,775
一起抱歉这个烂摊子和DW
together sorry for the mess but and DW

904
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,435
和DBn朱莉娅让你做块
and DB n Julia lets you make block

905
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,995
矩阵，你可以实际使用它们
matrices and you can actually use them

906
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,885
直接有一种特殊的类型权利
directly there'd be a special type right

907
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,135
没关系，然后你在这里发生了什么
there okay and then what goes here you

908
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,334
实际上可以看到它会是什么
could actually see what it would be

909
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,044
我希望我做得对，但是
would be I hope I'm doing it right but

910
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:39,104
有一个delta1X1和Delta和X.
there'd be a delta 1 X 1 and Delta and X

911
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:41,584
N和这将是对角矩阵
N and this would be a diagonal matrix

912
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:44,285
好的，然后我在这里有什么
okay and then what do I have over here

913
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:49,304
在这里，我有DeltaWS，如果你
here I'd have the Delta WS and if you

914
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:51,945
检查你会发现这将是我
check you'll see that this will be I'm

915
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,324
拿不到指数权和我
not gonna get the indices right and I

916
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:54,375
没时间，所以我要写
don't have time so I'm just gonna write

917
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,265
就像这样，现在我要去
it like this and now I'm just going to

918
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,365
告诉你故事的结局
give you the end of the story

919
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,675
你可以把所有这些写成DX
at a time you could write all this as DX

920
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,195
等于对角线矩阵乘以
is equal to a diagonal matrix times the

921
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,385
参数的导数加上a
derivative of the parameters plus a

922
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,595
再次下三角矩阵乘以DX
lower triangular matrix times D X again

923
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,845
所以如果你想解决这个问题
and so if you want to solve this linear

924
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,405
代数只做后向传播
algebra just does the back propagation

925
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:20,685
你有我减去LDX是DP或DX会
you have I minus L DX is d DP or DX will

926
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:26,085
如果我只是我减去L反DDP
be I minus L inverse D DP and if I only

927
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,065
想要最后一个元素让我们说E和as
want the last element let's say E and as

928
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,805
拉出最后一个的向量
the vector that pulls out the last

929
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,475
元素那么这就是我要去的
element then this is all I'm going to

930
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,515
需要得到我所有的衍生品和
need to get all my derivatives and

931
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,625
这个故事的寓意我是什么？
what's the moral of the story I

932
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,515
为一分钟而道歉但是
apologize for going one minute over but

933
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,005
道德的故事，而不是返回
the moral the story is instead of back

934
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,175
通过自己的辛勤劳动传播
propagating through your own hard work

935
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,765
你可能知道，当你解决一个
you probably know that when you solve a

936
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,285
下三角矩阵的人
lower triangular matrix people over a

937
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,475
编写代码，回传下层
written code that backhauls the lower

938
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,175
三角矩阵背面大背
triangular matrix the back the big back

939
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,335
这件作品已经实施了
piece has already been implemented for

940
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,945
你为什么要重新发明轮子呢？
you why do it why reinvent the wheel in

941
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,955
线性背面的反向传播
back propagation at the back of linear

942
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,725
代数已经有你看到我的后背
algebra already has the back you see I

943
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,945
意思是如果你只是这样做而你做到了
mean so if you just do this and you do

944
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,355
它用一种语言让你充实
it in a language to let you get full

945
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,655
你不需要做的全面表现
full performance you don't need to do

946
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,275
你自己的反传，因为a
your own back propagation because a

947
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,945
简单的反斜杠会为你做到这一点，所以我
simple backslash will do it for you so I

948
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,445
为过去而道歉我知道是否
apologize for going over I know if

949
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,795
斯特朗教授得到了一些最后的话
professor Strang got some final words

950
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,485
但无论如何线性代数是一个
but but anyway the linear algebra is a

951
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,015
一切都是秘密的
secret to everything that's that's the

952
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,715
大信息
big message

953
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,905
[掌声]
[Applause]

954
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,725
因为这是我们的最后两分钟或者减去
since it's our last two minutes or minus

955
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:39,225
1806年的两分钟五让我只是我
two minutes of 1806 five let me just I

956
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,295
希望你们喜欢它我当然
hope you guys enjoyed it I certainly

957
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,985
尽管你可以告诉它教导这个
enjoyed as you could tell teaching this

958
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:49,065
上课看看它会如何发展和写作
class seeing how it would go and writing

959
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,755
关于它
about it

960
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,275
所以我会告诉你的是关于
so I'll let you know was about the

961
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,555
写作，同时我会得到你的
writing and meanwhile I'll get your

962
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,045
写我的项目
writing on the projects which I

963
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,865
非常感谢，当然
appreciate very much and of course

964
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,895
成绩将会很好，我
grades are going to come out well and I

965
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,685
希望您喜欢它，谢谢大家
hope you've enjoyed it so thank you all

966
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,990
right thanks

967
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:12,619
好的，谢谢

968
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,619
[掌声]
