那是进来的
that are coming in

12
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,635
这就好，这是一个非常好的
this is like ok this is a really a good

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,835
课程的一部分，所以保持他们
part of the course and so keep them

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,895
如果和我很乐意给予
coming if and and I happy to give

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,575
无论我对这些反馈如何
whatever feedback I can on those

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,915
建议，并在那里开始
proposals and do make a start there

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,005
他们真的很好，如果有的话
they're really good and if if some are

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,915
在学期结束前完成
completed before the end of the semester

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,455
我们可以给生产提供机会
and we can give produce a chance offer

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,945
你有机会报告这些
you a chance to report on them that's

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:06,615
对那些人来说这太好了
that's good too so well done with those

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,815
建议所以我今天正在跳楼
proposals so while I'm today I'm jumping

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,495
第六部分
to part six

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,765
所以第六部分和第七部分是
so part six and part seven are

25
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,995
优化是最根本的
optimization which is the fundamental

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,185
进入深度学习的算法
algorithm that goes into deep learning

27
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,855
所以我们必须从优化开始
so we've got to start with optimization

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,654
每个人都必须获得该图片和
everybody has to get that picture and

29
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:30,755
然后部分7将是结构
then part seven will be the structure of

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,245
CNN的卷积神经网络和所有
CNN's convolutional neural nets and all

31
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,474
各种应用等等
that all kinds of applications and so

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,925
我们可以先从优化开始吗？
can we start with optimization so first

33
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,085
我能不能得到基本的事实
could I like get the basic facts about

34
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,205
泰勒系列的三个术语就是这样的
three terms of a Taylor series so that's

35
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,815
典型的是，我们很少会上升
typical it's seldom that we would go up

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,075
优化中的三阶导数
to third derivatives in optimization so

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,224
这是最有用的近似值
that's the most useful approximation to

38
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:03,885
一个功能每个人都在这里认识到它
a function everybody recognizes it here

39
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,875
我认为f只是一个功能
I'm thinking of f as just one function

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,884
和X只是一个变量，但现在我
and X as just one variable but but now I

41
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,814
真想去
really want to go to

42
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,154
更多变量，所以我需要做什么
more variables so what do I have to

43
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,794
如果f是更多的函数则改变
change if f is a function of more

44
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:29,325
变量所以现在我正在考虑X.
variables so now now I'm thinking of X

45
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:38,835
也没有让我看到我想要的
as well no let me see yeah I want n

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:49,245
这里的变量X是X1到xn所以是什么
variables here X is X 1 up to xn so what

47
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,064
它只是为了得到直截了当的话
it would just to get the words straight

48
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,745
所以我们可以开始对优化等什么
so we can begin on optimization so what

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,255
将是类似的步骤所以功能
will be the similar step so the function

50
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:07,064
f在X处记住X是n个变量没关系
f at X remember X is n variables okay

51
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,675
现在我有什么DeltaX呢
now what do I have Delta X so what

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,215
关于DeltaX现在有什么意义呢
what's the point about Delta X now it's

53
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,805
矢量DeltaX1到DeltaXn和什么
a vector Delta X 1 to Delta X n and what

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,865
关于F的导数它是一个向量
about the derivative of F it's a vector

55
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,255
相对于X的F的导数
to the derivative of F with respect to X

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,104
1是关于X2的F的导数
1 the derivative of F with respect X 2

57
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:30,134
等等等什么我有什么做的我
and so on so what do I have what do I

58
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,375
不得不改变我现在的那些
have to change about that I now those

59
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,685
伙计们是矢量，所以这是他们的点
guys are vectors so it's their dot

60
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,094
产品，所以它的DeltaX转置
product so it's Delta X transpose that

61
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:48,495
矢量时间这个DFDX所以是这样的
vector times this DF DX so what's the so

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,314
现在我正在取代所有人
this now I'm replacing this by all the

63
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:58,035
衍生物，它是渐变所以
derivatives and the it's the gradient so

64
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,895
的F在X上的梯度为
the gradient of F at X is the

65
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:12,014
衍生品让我们看到它至关重要
derivatives let's see it's essential to

66
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,255
直接在这里得到记号是的
get the notation straight here yeah so

67
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,014
它将是该的偏导数
it'll be the partial derivatives of the

68
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,075
函数f所以gradF是部分的
function f so grad F is the partial

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,035
F的衍生物相对于X1
derivatives of F with respect to X 1

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,975
向下偏导数的击到
down to partial derivative the strike to

71
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,205
考试还行，这是线性术语
exam okay good that's the linear term

72
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,345
现在什么是二次项1/2
and now what's the quadratic term 1/2

73
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,105
现在DeltaX不再是标量了
now Delta X isn't a scalar anymore it's

74
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,715
一个矢量，所以我将有DeltaX.
a vector so I'm going to have Delta X

75
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,345
转置和DeltaX以及进入的内容
transpose and a Delta X and what goes in

76
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,735
之间是二阶导数但是
between is the second derivatives but

77
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,695
我有一个n变量的函数和
I've got a function of n variables and

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,125
那么这是什么呢？现在我有了
so what does this mmm so now I have a

79
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,975
二阶导数矩阵
matrix of second derivatives right and

80
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,815
我会称之为H这是矩阵
I'll call it H this is the matrix of

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:14,175
二阶导数hJK是第二个
second derivatives h JK is the second

82
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,865
关于XJ和F的F的导数
derivative of F with respect to XJ and

83
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:23,445
XK又有什么名字这个家伙
XK and what's the name for this guy the

84
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:30,915
HessianHessian矩阵如何Hessians
Hessian Hessian matrix how the Hessians

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,345
钻进这张照片我不知道
got into this picture I don't know the

86
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,025
我认识的只有Hessians才是那些人
only Hessians I know are the ones who

87
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,585
为革命战争而战
fought in the Revolutionary War for

88
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,465
有人在我身边的那个人
somebody who which side were they on I

89
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,085
想想法国可能是错误的一面
think maybe the wrong side the French

90
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,465
在我们这边，是的，不管怎样，Hessian
were on our side and yeah anyway Hessian

91
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,135
矩阵和什么是事实
matrix and what what are the facts about

92
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,625
那个矩阵很好，第一个事实是
that matrix well the first fact is that

93
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,785
这是他们，关键的事实是它
it's them and the key fact is it's

94
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:04,065
对称的确定，再次，这是一个
symmetric ok and again that's an

95
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,305
近似所以所有人都参与其中
approximation so and everybody involved

96
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,985
认识到如果我们有乐趣，如果n是
recognizes that if we have a fun if n is

97
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,725
非常大，我们有一个功能
very large and we have a function of

98
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,535
许多变量然后我们有n个衍生物
many variables then we had n derivatives

99
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,505
计算这里和约1/2和
to compute here and about 1/2 and

100
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,965
使用一半的平方导数
squared derivatives using the the half

101
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,575
来自对称但关键
comes from the symmetry but the key

102
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,965
点是N平方变量
point is the N squared variables

103
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,765
衍生物来计算那里
derivatives to compute there so

104
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,555
如果n，计算梯度是可行的
computing the gradient is feasible if n

105
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,125
实际上是小的还是中等的
is small or moderately large actually

106
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,045
你用秋天
you by using autumn

107
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,045
分化背后的关键理念
differentiation the key idea of back

108
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,465
传播回来道具你可以得到你
propagation back prop you can get you

109
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,254
可以做到你可以加快计算速度
can do you can speed up the computation

110
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,914
衍生品相当惊人，但仍然
of derivatives quite amazingly but still

111
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,245
对于深度学习问题的规模
for the size of deep learning problems

112
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,444
因为这是这是如何达到这么好
as that's that's how to reach okay so

113
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:10,664
这是图片，然后我会想要
that's the picture and then I will want

114
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:15,495
解决使用这个解决方程式让
to solve use this to solve equations let

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:22,384
我有一个平行的图片给我们
me there's a parallel picture for us

116
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,355
矢量F所以现在这是一个向量
vector F so now this is a vector

117
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:34,425
这是X的F1到X的f
function this is F 1 of X up to f of X

118
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:42,525
X是X1到Xn所以我有n
and X is X 1 to X n so I have n

119
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,335
n个变量和函数的函数
functions of n variables and functions

120
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,855
n变量很好，这正是什么
of n variables well that's exactly what

121
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,615
我有一个想到的渐变
I have in the gradient that's think of

122
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,464
这两者是平行的并行存在
these two is parallel the parallel being

123
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:02,855
s对应于Fn的梯度
s is corresponds to the gradient of F n

124
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:15,134
n个变量的函数现在好了
functions of n variables ok ok so now

125
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,564
也许我在这里的目的是解决F.
maybe what I'm after here is to solve F

126
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,325
等于0所以我要考虑一下
equals 0 so I'm going to think about the

127
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,414
在F在X+δX所以它开始
the F at X plus Delta X so it starts

128
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:31,724
用f的X然后我们有
with f of X and then we have the

129
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,904
校正乘以第一个矩阵
correction times the matrix of first

130
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:40,954
衍生品以及它的名称是什么
derivatives and what's the name for that

131
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,975
一阶导数矩阵
matrix of first derivatives

132
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:53,445
好吧，如果我只给了n个函数而且我
well if I'm just given n functions and I

133
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,535
是的，我在这之后我的意思是什么
yeah what am i what am i after here I'm

134
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:06,195
寻找雅可比人，所以头发会去
looking for the Jacobian so hair will go

135
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,095
雅各比人J这是雅各比人
the Jacobian J this is the Jacobian

136
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,175
雅各比雅可比矩阵和
named after Jacobi Jacobian matrix and

137
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,495
JK条目的条目是什么？
what are its entries J the JK entry is

138
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,215
Jayce函数的导数
the derivative of the Jayce function

139
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,275
关于这个案子非常好
with respect to the case very okay and

140
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,995
我正在停止那里的第一顺序
I'm stopping a first-order there okay so

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,975
这些都是类似的事实
these are those sort of like facts of

142
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,775
你可以说1802的微积分事实
calculus facts of 1802 you could say

143
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,505
多变量微积分就是重点
multivariable calculus that's the point

144
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,035
注意我们正在做的就像
notice that we're we're doing just like

145
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,275
1802年上半年恰好不同
the first half of 1802 just different

146
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,275
微积分导数泰勒
differential calculus derivatives Taylor

147
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,075
我们不会做多个系列
series we're not doing multiple

148
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,385
积分不属于我们的世界
integrals that's not part of our world

149
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,375
这里好了，这就是背景现在我
here okay so that's the background now I

150
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,745
想看看优化还好吧
want to look at optimization okay okay

151
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,795
所以在这里我想要优化得很好
so over here I want to optimize well

152
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:22,565
让我试着最小化X的f
over here let me try to minimize f of X

153
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,015
我会在这里和矢量案例中
and I'll be in the vector case here and

154
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,335
在这里
over here

155
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:38,774
我想解决F等于零和
I want to solve F equals zero and of

156
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:44,085
当然这意味着F的意思是一个
course that means that means F of one

157
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,055
一直到FN等于零
equal to zero all the way along to F N

158
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:59,805
这里等于零我有n个方程式
equals zero here I have n equations let

159
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,865
我从那个开始，我会开始
me start with that one and I'll start

160
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,625
用牛顿的方法牛顿最好的
with Newton's method Newton the best to

161
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,155
在n个未知数中求解这n个方程
solve these n equations in n unknowns

162
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:22,605
好的，所以牛顿经常没有
okay so Newton which is often not

163
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,245
在1802年提出这是一种犯罪，因为
presented in 1802 that's a crime because

164
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,815
那就是那个大的应用
that's the that's the big application of

165
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,065
雅各比人的渐变好吧所以我
gradients in jacobians okay so I'm

166
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,775
试图解决n中的n个方程
trying to solve n equations in n

167
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,885
未知数，所以我希望F在X加Delta
unknowns and so I want F at X plus Delta

168
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,834
X为零，所以我想要X加上f
X to be zero right so I want f of X plus

169
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,375
DeltaX为零，因此X加上f
Delta X to be zero so so f of X plus

170
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,225
DeltaX是我把它归零
Delta X is I'm putting in a zero I'm

171
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,265
只是复制那个等式就是f在哪里
just copying that equation is f at where

172
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,615
我是X让我让K用这个案子
I am X let's let me use K for the case

173
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,815
迭代所以我在一个点XK我想
iteration so I'm at a point XK I want to

174
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,584
得到XK加一点，所以我已经0了
get to a point XK plus one and so I've 0

175
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:15,665
在那个时间点是X加J的f
is f of X plus J at that point times

176
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,185
DeltaX是XK加1减去XK
Delta X which is XK plus one minus XK

177
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,225
当然这是牛顿的方法
good that's Newton's method of course a

178
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,834
零是不完全正确的零
zero isn't quite true well zero will be

179
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,925
真正的对，如果我构建
true for the for the if I'm constructing

180
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,524
XK加一个我在这里构建XK
XK plus one here I'm constructing XK

181
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:40,095
加一个好，所以让我重写一下
plus one okay so let me just rewrite

182
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,515
那把刀，我们有牛顿的方法
that knife and we've got Newton's method

183
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,195
所以我们正在寻找这个
so we're looking for this

184
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:53,295
改变XK加一减XK我会把它
change XK plus one minus XK I'll put it

185
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,264
在这方面加上XK这就是这个
on this side s plus XK so that's this

186
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:02,024
现在我必须将其反转并将其打开
now I have to invert that and put it on

187
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,704
等式的另一面如此
the other side of the equation so

188
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,855
这将是一个减去这个家伙将是
that'll go with a minus this guy will be

189
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:16,425
颠倒和F在XK那是牛顿的
inverted and F at XK that's Newton's

190
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,165
方法自然让我再说一遍，
method natural let me just repeat that

191
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,925
你看到XK加1减去XK的位置
you see where the XK plus 1 minus XK is

192
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:30,735
城市权利，我把FXK转移到另一个
city right and I moved FX K to the other

193
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,105
一边用减号然后我
side with a minus sign and then I

194
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,555
乘以J逆，所以我得到了
multiply through by J inverse so I got

195
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,035
那
that

196
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,774
所以这是牛顿的系统方法
so that's Newton's method for a system

197
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,005
方程式，但在那里，我要去
of equations but over there I'm going to

198
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,535
写下牛顿的方法
write down Newton's method for

199
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,315
最小化功能这是基本的
minimizing a function this is such basic

200
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,135
我们必须从这里开始的东西让我
stuff that we have to begin here let me

201
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,495
甚至从极端开始
even begin with a with a extremely

202
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,524
牛顿的直截了当的例子
straightforward example of Newton's

203
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,385
这里的方法假设我的功能我
method here suppose my function I

204
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,524
假设我只有一个功能
suppose I've only got one function

205
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,954
实际上我想我只有一个
actually suppose I only have one

206
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,405
功能如此，所以我想我的
function so so I'm so suppose my

207
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,704
函数是x平方减去9而我想要的
function is x squared minus 9 and I want

208
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,565
解决X的f等于0我想找到
to solve f of X equals 0 I want to find

209
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,194
这个9的平方根好吧那又怎么样
this square root of 9 okay so what what

210
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,144
牛顿的方法是我们应该的
is Newton's method for it we just should

211
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:35,925
看到我的观点只是看看牛顿是怎么回事
see my point is just to see how Newton's

212
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,105
写入方法然后重写它
method is written and then rewrite it a

213
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,415
有点让我们看到有
little bit so that we see there

214
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,405
收敛好吧当然是这样的
convergence okay so so of course the

215
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,905
雅可比是2倍，所以牛顿的方法说
Jacobian is 2x so Newton's method says

216
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,514
XK加1我只是要复制
that XK plus 1 I'm just going to copy

217
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,745
那
that

218
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,005
减1超过2XK
minus 1 over 2 XK

219
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,165
这是X的衍生时间F.
right that's the derivative times F at X

220
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:12,685
K这是XK平方减去9好
K which is XK squared minus 9 okay

221
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,655
我们按照公式我们这个
we followed the formula we that this

222
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,595
确定XK加1，让我们让它
determines XK plus 1 and let's let's

223
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,665
简化它所以在这里我有XK-那
simplify it so here I have XK - that

224
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,145
看起来像XK的一半所以我想我
looks like a half of XK so I think I

225
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,795
有一半的XK然后这一次
have a half of XK and then this times

226
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:40,405
这是一个超过XK的9个半部分
this is 9 halves of one over X K is that

227
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:46,335
XK的右半部分来自这个东西
right half of XK from this stuff and

228
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:53,085
加上X的一半加上一半好吧
plus nine halves of one over X here ok

229
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,265
我能不能检查一下我是否知道
can I just like check that I know the

230
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,975
答案是三，我可以肯定我得到了
answer is three can I be sure that I get

231
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,615
正确答案3所以这就是如果
the right answer 3 so this was that if

232
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,515
如果XK当然是三个当然我
if XK was exactly three then of course I

233
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,175
期待XK加1保持3，所以做什么
expect XK plus 1 to stay at 3 so do what

234
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,175
这样做会发生在三分之一和
does that happen so half of three and

235
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,185
九个一半的服务是什么
nine halves of one serve what's that

236
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,105
三分之一和九分之一
half of three and nine halves of

237
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,445
三分之一没关系就是那三个
one-third okay that's that's three

238
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,485
六分之一和半分三分
halves and three halves at six halves

239
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:36,025
这三个还好，所以我们已经
and that's three okay okay so we've

240
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,855
检查方法是否一致
checked that the method is consistent

241
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,585
这意味着我们保留了代数
which just means we kept the algebra

242
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,335
笔直但后来真正重要的
straight but then the really important

243
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,455
关于牛顿方法的观点是这样的
point about Newton's method is this is

244
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,965
现在发现它收敛的速度有多快
to discover how fast it converges so now

245
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,375
让我DKXK加一减三所以
let me dou XK plus one minus three so

246
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,265
现在我正在看我的错误
now I'm looking at the error which is I

247
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,765
希望接近零
hope approaching zero

248
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,645
它接近零的速度有多快
is it approaching zero how quickly is it

249
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,965
接近零是这些
approaching zero these are the

250
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,565
因此优化的基本问题
fundamental questions of optimization so

251
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,095
我要从两个中减去三个
I'm going to subtract three from both

252
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,705
双方
sides

253
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,245
不知怎的，从这里好吧我想我会的
somehow okay from here I guess I'm gonna

254
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,655
减去三者可以我，所以我只是
subtract three can I just so I was just

255
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,815
检查它是否正确现在好了
checking that it was correct okay now so

256
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,355
XK加一减三我会
XK plus one minus three I'm gonna

257
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,575
从两侧减去三，我要去
subtract three from both sides I'm gonna

258
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,185
减去那里三，然后我希望
subtract three there and then I hope

259
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,325
就是那个盒子就是下来的东西
that that's that box is what goes down

260
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,355
这里右边两个减去了三个
here right subtracted three from both

261
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,805
所以我看着我希望它
sides so I'm looking at I'm hoping it

262
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,255
现在去希望事情变成零好吗
goes now hoping things go to zero okay

263
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,545
所以我有什么让我考虑因素
so what do I have there let me factor

264
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:59,485
超过XK1，所以我有什么
out the 1 over X K so what do I have

265
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,505
然后在XK上留下一个，所以有一个9
then left one over X K so there's a 9

266
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,905
XK上有一半，所以我
halves from there one over X K so I

267
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,955
真的有XK平方的1/2是因为
really have 1/2 of X K squared because

268
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,555
我除以nXK，这减去3我
I've divided by n X K and this minus 3 I

269
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,565
因为我是最好的减去3XK
better put minus 3 X K cause I'm

270
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,465
除以XKI声称这没关系
dividing by X K I claim that that's okay

271
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,445
现在我知道了
now I've got it

272
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,305
让我们看看让我拿出2来
and let's see let me take out the 2 to

273
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:41,635
忘了这两个人，让我成为一个6
forget these twos and make that a 6 so I

274
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,385
超过2XK倍9加XK
have 1 over 2 X K times 9 plus X K

275
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,145
平方减6对此有什么好处
squared minus 6 anything good about that

276
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:58,255
我们希望这一周我们希望那样
we hope so week we hope that that is

277
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,255
有吸引力的东西，所以这又是
something attractive so this is again

278
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,905
这是步骤K加1和1的错误
this is the error at step K plus 1 and

279
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:11,215
这个东西超过2倍XK的1倍
it's 1 over 2 X K times this thing in

280
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,755
括号9加XK平方减去6xk
brackets 9 plus X K squared minus 6x k

281
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:22,405
我们认识到，随着XK零下3
and we recognize that as X K minus 3

282
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,295
平方
squared

283
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,175
XK平方减去其中六个加上9个
XK squared minus six of them plus 9

284
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:36,915
这是XK减3平方好吧
that's XK minus 3 squared okay that was

285
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,055
目标当然是目标
the goal of course that's the goal that

286
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,695
显示为什么牛顿的方法太棒了
shows why Newton's method is fantastic

287
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,935
如果你能执行它，如果你可以开始
if you can execute it if you can start

288
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,055
接近通知那就是那个
near enough notice that so that's that's

289
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,505
所以我怎么形容这个伟大的
so how do I describe this this great

290
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,055
等式，它说错误是
equation it says that the error is

291
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,735
每一步都是平方的
squared at every step

292
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,275
如果我是的话，每一步都是平方的
squared at every step so if I'm

293
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,525
收敛到它会满足的极限
converging to a limit it will satisfy

294
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:12,855
这将是3或我猜减3
that it'll be 3 or I guess minus 3 is

295
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,165
那可能
that possible

296
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,075
是的减3是这里的另一个解决方案
yeah minus 3 is another solution here so

297
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,385
我们所以我们有两个解决方案
we're so we've got two solutions the

298
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,175
牛顿法可以收敛到凌晨3点我
Newton's method could converge to 3 am i

299
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,325
它可以收敛到负3所以我
right it could converge to minus 3 so I

300
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,265
我可以有一个类似的等式排序
could I'd have a similar equation sort

301
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,795
以-3为中心或者它是什么
of centered at minus 3 or what does it

302
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,585
总是做其中一个可能爆炸的事情
always do one of those it could blow up

303
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,095
它可以让所以这些都是有
it could so that so those are there are

304
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,735
那种有吸引力的地区
sort of regions of Attraction there are

305
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,015
所有接近3的起点
all the starting points that approach 3

306
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,825
而这个等式的重点是
and the whole point of that equation is

307
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,705
二次收敛的误差
with quadratic convergence the error

308
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,645
在它看来的每一步都被平方
being squared at every step it seems in

309
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,165
三，然后就是这一切
on three then there's a whole all these

310
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,265
可以去的起点
starting points that would would go to

311
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,995
减3然后他们开始
minus 3 and then their their starting

312
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,265
那些会爆炸的点数和
points that would blow up so and and

313
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,845
那可能是为了这个非常简单
those may be for this very simple

314
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,365
问题是，画面是不是太
problem that the picture is not too

315
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,195
很难理清那三个
difficult to sort out those three

316
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,185
区域，但如果我们有，这是
regions but if we had and this is

317
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,255
允许矢量
allowing for a vector

318
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,705
我们就是两个方程式或n个方程式
two equations or n equations then we're

319
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,195
在n个变量中，你真的得到了
in n variables and is really you get

320
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,005
美丽的图片你得到一些
beautiful pictures you get some some of

321
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,764
给出的图片类型有所增加
the type of pictures that gave gave rise

322
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:42,404
这些关于分形图的书籍
to these books on fractals the picture

323
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,154
关于分形的书-对于这些盆地
books on fractals - for these basins of

324
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,215
吸引力是否起作用
attraction does the does the starting

325
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,215
点引导您进入其中一个解决方案
point lead you to one of the solutions

326
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,154
或者它会引导你到达无限远
or does it lead you to infinity here it

327
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,225
只画画会很有趣
that would be interesting to just draw

328
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,215
这是好的，但必不可少的
it for this okay but the the essential

329
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,315
要点是它们是二次收敛
point is they're quadratic convergence

330
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,615
如果它足够接近你会看到它有
if it's close enough you see that it has

331
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,185
如果XK是X0则关闭
to be close if if X K is if X 0 is

332
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,825
非常接近3然后这是关于
pretty near 3 then this is about

333
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:18,914
六分之一，那将是一件好事
one-sixth of that and there'll be a good

334
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,644
在这种情况下吸引力区域没关系
region of Attraction in this case okay

335
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:27,544
这就是牛顿的方法
so that's that's Newton's method for

336
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:31,095
方程式，现在我想做牛顿的
equations and now I want to do Newton's

337
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,725
方法
method

338
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,644
我只想转换所有这些词
I just want to convert all those words

339
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:37,605
以牛顿的优化方法
over to Newton's method for optimization

340
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,884
所以记住这些板子
so remember the these boards were

341
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,014
求解F等于0
solving F equals 0

342
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:48,345
这个董事会正在尽量减少资本F和
this board is minimizing capital F and

343
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,774
他们之间有什么联系
what's the connection between them well

344
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,274
当然，当我们对应的时候
of course when we this corresponds to

345
00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:05,804
如果我是的话，至少解决梯度问题
solving the gradient at a minimum if I'm

346
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,715
最小化我找到一个点所有
minimizing I'm finding a point where all

347
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,894
第一个导数是零，所以
the first derivatives are zero so so

348
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:14,505
这将是这些之间的匹配
that'll be the match between these that

349
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:19,575
在这张照片中这个正确的F是
that this right F in this picture is the

350
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,884
那幅画中的小F.
small F in that picture

351
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:29,105
好吧，我猜我在这里，这是
ok now I guess here I have and this is

352
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,034
我们的应用程序的核心
sort of the heart of our applications to

353
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,615
深度学习我们非常复杂
deep learning we have very complicated

354
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,495
损失函数以最小化函数
loss functions to minimize functions of

355
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,804
数千或数百
thousands or hundred

356
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,514
成千上万的变量还可以
thousands of variable okay so that means

357
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,195
我们想用牛顿的
that we would like to use Newton's

358
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,284
方法，但往往我们不能让我这样
method but often we can't let me so let

359
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:53,014
我所以我需要在这里放两个
me so I need to to put down here two

360
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,735
方法一不涉及那些
methods one that doesn't involve those

361
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,554
高二阶导数和一个a
high second derivatives and one a

362
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,874
牛顿这样做首先如此
Newton's that does so so so first so

363
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:07,254
首先，我会写下一个方法
first I'll write down a method that does

364
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:14,254
不涉及如此方法一和这个
not involve so so method one and this

365
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:25,534
将是最陡峭的下降，是什么
will be steepest descent and what is

366
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:30,274
那说XK加一个新的
that that says that XK plus one the new

367
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:36,394
X是旧的X减去我最陡的下降
X is the old X minus my steepest descent

368
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:38,945
意味着我进入最陡峭的状态
means that I move in the steepest

369
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,674
方向是哪个方向
direction which is the direction of the

370
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,014
FI的梯度移动了一段距离而我
gradient of F I move some distance and I

371
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,134
更好地有自由来决定那是什么
better have freedom to decide what that

372
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:53,554
距离应该是这一步
distance should be so this is a step

373
00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:01,054
大小是或用深语
size yes or in the language of deep

374
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:03,154
学习它通常被称为学习
learning it's often called the learning

375
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:18,904
速率学习率还可以
rate learning rate okay so is that that

376
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:23,855
所以我们选择SK是很自然的
so and it's natural to choose SK we're

377
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,284
你一路走来看看这是什么
going along do you see where what this

378
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:28,264
右手边看起来像我在
right hand side looks like I'm at a

379
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,494
在n维中指出它们都是它
point in n dimensions they were all it

380
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:34,835
在这里我们有n个维度
were in n dimensions here we have

381
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,225
n个变量的函数有一个
functions of n variables there's a

382
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,284
向量有一个向下移动的方向
vector there's a direction to move down

383
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:45,364
图的最陡斜率
the steepest slope of the of the graph

384
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:49,264
这是移动的距离，我们
and here's a distance to move and we

385
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,725
将停止我们必须得到这个
will stop we'll have to get off this

386
00:25:53,730 --> 00:26:00,754
如果我们坚持下去，通常会迈出一步
step normally if we if we stay on it a

387
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,514
小摇摆它会回来它会采取
little sway it'll swing back it'll take

388
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,134
我们走向无限
us off to infinity

389
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:08,495
等你想要选择SK
wait the the you would like to choose SK

390
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,404
这样你就可以减少资金F.
so that you minimize capital F you take

391
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:17,524
这一点上的这一点，这就是我
the point on this line so this is I'm

392
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:23,065
这是我们朝着一个方向发展的一条线
this is a line in our in a direction in

393
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:31,114
RN以及该线路上的所有点
RN and for all the points on that line

394
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,225
在那个方向F有一些价值和
in that direction F has some value and

395
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,554
你期望的是最初的
what you expect is that initially

396
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,475
因为你明智地选择了它的价值
because you chose it sensibly the value

397
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,325
F会下降但是会有所下降
of F will drop but then at a certain

398
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,595
指出它会转向你
point it'll it'll turn turn back on you

399
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,935
并增加，这将是
and increase so that would be the

400
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,424
自然停留点，那就是我
natural stopping point and that would I

401
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,575
会说这就是一个确切的线搜索等等
would call that an exact line search so

402
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,544
精确的线搜索将是确切的线
exact line search would be exact line

403
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:12,424
搜索是当然最好的感觉
search is the best sense of course that

404
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:17,044
需要时间来计算和你
would take time to to compute and you

405
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,104
可能在深度学习的时候
probably in deep learning that's time

406
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:24,424
你负担不起，所以你修复了学习
you can't afford so you fix the learning

407
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:28,024
你也可以选择点o1
rate s maybe you choose point o1 to be

408
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:31,294
非常安全，所以这是方法之一
pretty safe okay so that's method one

409
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,874
最陡的血统现在是一种方法二
steepest descent now a method two will

410
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:44,494
是牛顿的方法所以现在我们有了XK
be Newton's method so now we have XK

411
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:53,044
加一个我的两个XK减去一些时间
plus one my two XK minus something times

412
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:58,164
达美F
Delta F

413
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:01,174
现在我要做正确的事
and now I'm going to do the right thing

414
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,345
我要住在这里和右边
I'm gonna live right here and the right

415
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,414
事情是Hessian的第二个
thing is the Hessian the second

416
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,905
导致这就是这个
derivative that's what this is this was

417
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,845
便宜我们只是采取了方向和
cheap we just took the direction and and

418
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,725
现在我们真的开始了
went along it now we're getting really

419
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,174
使用第二个方向正确的方向
the right direction by using the second

420
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:24,455
导数使得H逆向可以和
derivative so that's H inverse okay and

421
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:32,255
我所做的就是将其设定为
what I've done is to is to set that to

422
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:38,465
零，所以你会看到那些
zero so that would be do you see thats

423
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,635
牛顿的方法
Newton's method

424
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,075
它与这个家伙完全平行
it's totally parallel to this guy

425
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,865
实际上，我很高兴有这些
actually I'm really happy to have these

426
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,835
两块板在板上相互平行
two on the board parallel to each other

427
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,995
因为你必须保持
because you have to kind of keep

428
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,125
直接你在解决方程式
straight are you solving equations or

429
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,125
你最小化功能，你是谁
are you minimizing functions and you're

430
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,705
在两者中使用不同的字母
using different letters in the two

431
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,044
问题，但现在你看他们如何匹配
problems but now you see how they match

432
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:08,285
比赛的雅各比亚再次如此
the Jacobian of so so again the matches

433
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,085
因为F为F的梯度是
think of F as the gradient of F that's

434
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,655
这就是你应该这么想的方式
that's the way you should think of it so

435
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:22,895
渐变的雅可比行列式是
the Jacobian for of the gradient is the

436
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,375
粗麻布雅可比的梯度
Hessian the Jacobian of the gradient is

437
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,745
Hessian，这是有道理的，因为
the Hessian and that makes sense because

438
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,025
我们采取的一阶导数
we take the first derivative of the

439
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,554
一阶导数是第二个
first derivative is the second

440
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,345
只有我们正在做矩阵的导数
derivative only we're doing matrix y so

441
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,755
这就是渐变的雅可比行列式
that's so the Jacobian of the gradient

442
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,465
我们正在做一个矢量矩阵句
we're doing a vector matrix sentence

443
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,955
而非标句
instead of a scalar sentence the

444
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,245
渐变的雅可比行列式是一个Hessian
Jacobian of the gradient is a Hessian

445
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,965
是的，没错，这就是我想要的
yep right okay so that's what I wanted

446
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,965
首先要获得那些基本的
to start with just to get those basic

447
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,385
事实下来，所以基本事实是
facts down and so the basic facts were

448
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,135
这是泰勒系列的三个术语
the were the three term Taylor series

449
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,995
然后是基本算法
and then the basic algorithms followed

450
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,015
自然而然地通过设置
naturally from it by setting the

451
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,685
如果那样，FF在新的点为零
FF at the new point to zero if that's

452
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,175
你在解决什么或者假设他
what you were solving or by assume he

453
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,635
现在有好一个好好好
had right good good good good okay now

454
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,185
现在我们要考虑解决什么问题
what now we have to think about solving

455
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,045
这些问题
these problems

456
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,855
他们研究的是他们收集的费率
studying do they converge what rate do

457
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,375
他们很好地收敛了
they converge well that's the rate of

458
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,885
收敛就像我采取的原因
convergence is like what I why I took

459
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,605
这分开了这个例子所以
this separated off this example so the

460
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,555
牛顿法的收敛速度
convergence rate for Newton's method

461
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,165
将是二次的，误差得到平方
will be quadratic the error gets squared

462
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,905
当然这意味着超级快
and of course that means super fast

463
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,225
如果你足够接近就会收敛
convergence if you start close enough

464
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,145
最陡峭的收敛率
the rate of convergence for a steepest

465
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,875
血统当然不是你不是
descent is of course not you're not

466
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,645
在这里摆弄错误，因为你
squaring errors here because you're

467
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,925
你只需要取一些数字
you're just taking some number instead

468
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,615
因此，正确矩阵的逆
of the inverse of the correct matrix so

469
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:12,815
你不能指望SuperSpeed这么一个
you you can't expect SuperSpeed so a

470
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,335
线性收敛速度
linear rate of convergence would be

471
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,545
对，你期望错误给你
right you expect that the error to you

472
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,755
我想知道错误是
would like to know that the error is

473
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,065
乘以一些人说的每一步
multiplied by said every step by some

474
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,695
恒定低于一个
constant below one that would be a

475
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,995
线性速率与be相比
linear rate where compared to be

476
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,875
乘以每个平方
multiplied by being squared at every

477
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,785
步骤，这将是我们的基本
step and so this will be our our basic

478
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:46,675
这是for的基本公式
this is the basic formula for for

479
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,505
大规模的真正大规模
large-scale for really large-scale

480
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,435
问题，当然有方法
problems and there are methods of course

481
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,955
人们会提出方法
people are going to come up with methods

482
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,895
他们有点像牛顿的便宜
that they're sort of a cheap Newton's

483
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,385
方法LevenbergMarquardt和它在
method Levenberg Marquardt and it's in

484
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,145
笔记在本节末
the notes at the end of this section at

485
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,145
我们将在六点结束
the end of the six point for that we'll

486
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,835
到达
get to

487
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,595
所以LevenbergMarquardt是一种
so Levenberg Marquardt is a sort of

488
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,995
廉价男人的牛顿牛顿的方法呢
cheap man's Newton's Newton's method it

489
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,175
不计算到Hessian但它可以
does not compute to Hessian but it can

490
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,505
但它说我可以欠我的
but it says okay I owe i from the

491
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,605
渐变我可以看到一个
gradient I can see a

492
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,674
你知道在黑森州有一个词
sort of one term in the Hesse you know

493
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,304
所以它抓住了那个词，但并不完全
so it grabs that term but it's not fully

494
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:37,804
完全二阶好，所以现在我们现在
fully second-order okay so now we're now

495
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:41,015
我们必须考虑问题和我
we have to think about problems and I

496
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,745
猜猜这里的信息是完整的
guess the whole the the message here is

497
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,525
我们的出发点必须是
and our starting point has to be

498
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:51,424
凸凸是关键词
convexity convexity is the key word for

499
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:55,235
这对于这些问题的解决方案
this for these for these problems for

500
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,695
我们想要最小化的功能
the function that we want to minimize if

501
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,455
这首先是凸函数
that's a convex function well first of

502
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,075
所有凸函数都可能
all the convex function is likely to

503
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,865
有一个最小和图片
have one minimum and the picture that's

504
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,865
在我们这个最陡的血统中
in our mind of steepest descent this

505
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,435
碗的图片碗是图表
picture of a bowl a bowl is the graph of

506
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,105
一个凸函数，所以我在转
a convex function so that so I'm turning

507
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,865
现在，我将离开那个董事会
to convexity now I'll leave that board

508
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,685
那是因为那非常重要
there because that's pretty crucial and

509
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,435
谈论凸凸的概念
speak about the idea of convexity convex

510
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:40,054
功能凸集让我们致电
function convex set so let's call the

511
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:45,455
X的函数f和典型的凸集
function f of X and typical convex set

512
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:51,035
将我称之为k好，所以我们只是
will be i'll call it k okay so we just

513
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,674
想要记住这个词能做什么
want to remember what does that word can

514
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,105
凸均值，你怎么知道你
convex mean and how do you know if you

515
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,835
具有凸函数或凸集
have a convex function or a convex set

516
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,044
好吧，让我先从凸集开始吧
okay let me start with convex set so

517
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:05,255
这是因为这是我的一般问题
it's a because here's my general problem

518
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:16,384
我希望你的凸最小化
my convex minimization which you hope to

519
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,874
你有很多应用程序
have an in many applications you do have

520
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:26,345
所以你最小化凸函数
so you minimize a convex function for

521
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:32,134
在凸集中指向如此
points in a convex set so that's like

522
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,225
理想的情况是理想的
the ideal situation that's the ideal

523
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,404
情况好吧得到的东西
situation okay get something

524
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,765
内部强大的凸起
inside something powerful convexity the

525
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,854
功能是凸的，所以让我画
function is convex and so let me draw

526
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:47,074
我们的凸函数与图形
our convex function with the graph

527
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:52,374
好的，所以我将绘制我们的凸函数说
ok so I'll draw our convex function say

528
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:56,824
碗，这是一个X和F的图形
Bowl so that's a graph of f of X and

529
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:04,445
那么这里是带X1和X的X.
then so here are the X's with X 1 and X

530
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:09,784
基数为2，X为f的图形
2 in the base and the graph of f of X 1

531
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:17,705
X2在这里好吧其实我在那边
X 2 up here okay actually I'm over there

532
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,975
我应该把这个功能叫做我
I should be calling this function f I

533
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:30,185
认为是的，是的，小F会
think is that right yeah little F would

534
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,364
是的，我是这个家伙
be there graining of this guy yeah I

535
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:43,594
这么好，所以现在我是
think so okay so so what now I'm

536
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,344
在某些X上超过X最小化
minimizing over X in over certain X's

537
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:50,614
并非所有的X都可以最小化
not all X's I might be minimizing for

538
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:59,854
例子K可能是ax所在的集合
example K might be the set where ax

539
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:05,854
在这种情况下，等于BK可能是a
equals B K might be in that case a

540
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,515
当I时，衬底或移位的子空间
substrate or a shifted subspace when I

541
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,534
说子空间然后1806提醒
said subspace but then 1806 is reminding

542
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,005
在我的脑海里，我只有一个
me in my mind that I only have a

543
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,415
当V为0但是我有你的子空间
subspace when V is 0 but I have a you

544
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,695
知道排序的子空间的单词
know the word for a subspace that sort

545
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,774
移动了罚款，所以我只是把
of moved over a fine so I'll just put

546
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:31,205
那个词倒了一堆词来学习
that word down a bunch of words to learn

547
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:39,125
对于这个主题，但没关系，所以这是它的
for this topic but okay so it's a it's

548
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,344
像飞机但不一定通过
like a plane but not necessarily through

549
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:44,284
如果B为0则原点不会出现
the origin if B is 0 it doesn't go

550
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:48,604
如果B不管怎么说还是我有
through if B is not ok anyway or I have

551
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,794
其他一些凸集让我放
some other convex set let me just put

552
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:51,545
这个
this

553
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:58,475
就像在基地说K，我做了
like said K in the base and did I make

554
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,625
它凸起我觉得我很幸运
it convex I think pretty good luckily I

555
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:10,265
所以现在有什么好凸设置做
did so now what well the convex sets the

556
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,575
约束因此这是约束
the constraint so this is the constraint

557
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:20,215
set约束是X必须是X所在
set constraint is that X must be X is in

558
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:26,165
集合K好吧，我把它画成凸面
the set K okay and I drew it as a convex

559
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:30,145
blob这里是一个例子，它是一个
blob here was an example where it's a

560
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,245
扁平不是斑点而是平坦的平面
flat not a blob but a flat flat plane

561
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,735
但是让我回到什么地步呢？
but what does let me come back to what

562
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,795
凸起意味着什么是凸起的
does convex mean what what's a convex

563
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,365
组
set

564
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:46,325
是的，我们必须这样做
yeah let's we have to do that should

565
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:54,295
之前已经这样做了
have done that before

566
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,165
在笔记中我有乐趣
in the in the notes I had the fun of

567
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,655
弄清楚如果我拿了两个，我是否选了两个
figuring out if I took two if I took a

568
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,285
三角形是一个凸集让我们正好
triangle is that a convex set let's just

569
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:11,915
确定这是一个凸集是什么
be sure so what's a convex set that is a

570
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,825
凸集因为如果我采取任何两个
convex set because if I take any two

571
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,255
集合中的点并绘制线条
points in the set and draw the line

572
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,785
它们之间保持在这个集合中
between them it stays in this set so

573
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:30,305
这是来自x1的任何边缘线的凸性
that's convexity any edge line from x1

574
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:40,055
到x2保持在设置好的所以
to x2 stays in in the set okay good so

575
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,385
这里是我的小锻炼自己有什么
here's my little exercise to myself what

576
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,715
如果我把两个三角形的联合全部
if I took the union of two triangles all

577
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,265
我想让你做的是这种
I want to get you to do is this sort of

578
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,195
事物可视化凸而不凸
thing visualize convex and not convex

579
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,685
可能性假设我有两个
possibilities suppose I have two one

580
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:02,255
三角形，即使它是钝的
triangle even if it was obtuse that's

581
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,305
还是向右凸
still convex right

582
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,695
没问题，但现在如果我把它们
no problem but now what if I put those

583
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,995
两个三角形一起取得联合
two triangles together take their union

584
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,695
好吧，如果我带他们坐在一个大
well if I take them sitting with a big

585
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,685
像我失去的差距我的意思是我
gap between like I've lost I mean I've

586
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,285
从来没有这样的机会，因为如果我
never had a chance that way because if I

587
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,505
拿了我的一个，如果它是联盟的
took one of my if it was the union of

588
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,095
这两个那么你知道我该怎么
these two well you know what I'm gonna

589
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,375
如果我在那一点上采取了这一点
say if I took that point in that point

590
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,465
当然，这一切都是愚蠢的
of course it goes outside stupid all

591
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,275
正确的东西有关，但什么，如果
right what about a but what if the

592
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,265
三角形如果那个三角形怎么样
triangles what if what if that triangle

593
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,865
下三角形重叠的那种
that lower triangle kind of overlaps the

594
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,965
上三角是一个凸集
upper triangle is that a convex set

595
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:49,245
你是对的，说不出原因
you're everybody's right saying no why

596
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,525
我如何看待那两者的结合
how do I see that the union of those two

597
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,805
三角形不是凸集你
triangles is not a convex set guys you

598
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,655
告诉我在哪里选择两点
tell me where to pick two points where

599
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,445
这条线很好，我从一条线上拿走了
the line goes out well I take one from

600
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,115
那个角落和那个角落里的一个角落
that corner and one from that corner and

601
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,355
他们之间的界限走了出去
the line between them went outside

602
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:22,095
所以你的联盟通常不会很好
so you Union is usually not convex well

603
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,405
如果我想到两套联合我的
if I think of the union of two sets my

604
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,015
心灵实际上自动去了
mind actually automatically goes to the

605
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,285
另一个相应的可能性
the other corresponding possibility

606
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:35,355
这是两者的交点
which is the intersection of the two

607
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,265
如果我采取交集，那么设置
sets so if I take the intersection of

608
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:44,745
两套现在有什么处理
the two sets now what's the deal with

609
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,275
那
that

610
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,345
什么时候我有两个三角形
what was the when I had two triangles

611
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,275
两个分开的三角形我们能做什么
two separated triangles what what can we

612
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,435
说说这两者的交集
say about the intersection of those two

613
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,505
三角形它是空的所以我们应该考虑
triangles it's empty so shall we regard

614
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,125
空集作为凸集是不是
the empty set as a convex set yes isn't

615
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,955
它是空的，所以它没有任何东西
it it's vacuous so it hasn't got any

616
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,735
问题吧
problems right

617
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,405
还好，但现在是交点
okay but now is the intersection is

618
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,854
如果我假设两个，那么总是凸出来的
always convex if I'm assuming the two

619
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:22,945
我们开始的集合现在就是这样
sets that we start with are now that's

620
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,094
交叉口的一个重要事实
an important fact that the intersection

621
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,045
凸集让我们只画一幅画
of convex sets let's just draw a picture

622
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:34,825
这显示了一个例子，那是什么
that shows an example so what's the

623
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,125
只是这个部分和它的交叉点
intersection just this part and it's

624
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,945
凸好你能不能给我一点
convex okay can you give me a little

625
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:48,655
证明了交叉点是凸的，以便
proof that the intersection is convex so

626
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,364
我在十字路口拿两分
I take two points in the intersection

627
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:55,075
让我开始测试是否
let me start the proof to test if

628
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,084
什么是凸的你怎么测试它
something's convex how do you test it

629
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:00,235
你在集合中取两个点
you take two points in the set in the

630
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,215
交叉，你想表明
intersection and you want to show that

631
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,725
他们之间的界限在
the line between them is in the

632
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,785
交叉路口好吗为什么这么好
intersection okay why is that so take

633
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:13,675
两个点在交叉点取x1
two points take x1 in the intersection

634
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,364
我们这里有两套，那是
of we've got two sets here and that's

635
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,795
交叉的象征，我们
the symbol for intersection and we've

636
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,995
在十字路口得到另一个点
got another point in the intersection

637
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,425
现在我们想看一下这条线
and now we want to look at the line

638
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:32,295
它们之间是从x1到x2的线
between them the line from x1 to x2

639
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,155
与那个人有什么关系呢
what's the deal with that one is that

640
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,985
完全在x1中的k1
fully in x1 in k1

641
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,225
为什么它完全在k1这我们拿了两个
why is it fully in k1 this we took two

642
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,555
在我看的十字路口的点
points in the intersection I'm looking

643
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,735
在他们和我之间的界限
at the line between them and I'm asking

644
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,225
它是在第一组k1和答案
is it in the first set k1 and the answer

645
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,725
是是的
is yes

646
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:59,725
因为那些点在k1和k1
because those points were in k1 and k1

647
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,655
是凸的，是它们之间的那条线
is convex and is that line between them

648
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:09,175
在k2是的，同样的原因X两个
in k2 yes same reason the X the two

649
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,295
端点在k2所以之间的界限
endpoints were in k2 so the line between

650
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,145
它们在k管所以交叉
them is in k tube so the intersection of

651
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,545
凸集总是凸出来的
convex sets is always convex the

652
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:22,715
凸起的交叉点
intersection of convex

653
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,025
这很好，所以你会在笔记中看到
it's good so you'll see in the notes

654
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,545
两个三角形的这些可能性
these possibilities with two triangles

655
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,725
有有时你可以你可以采取
there's sometimes you can you can take

656
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,555
联盟，但不是经常
the Union but not very often

657
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,465
好吧，现在我接下来的是什么
okay now what's what's the next thing I

658
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:44,225
必须做我们得到的凸函数
have to do convex functions we got

659
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,505
凸集什么是凸函数
convex sets what are convex functions

660
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,935
那么我们是对的，因为这是
then we're good right because this is

661
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,104
我们这是我们问题的原型
our this is our prototype of a problem

662
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:55,025
我现在想知道它意味着什么
and I now want to know what it means to

663
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,145
为了那个F我是一个自信的人
be for that F to be a confident I'm

664
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,245
抱歉，我现在知道它对于这意味着什么
sorry I now know what it means for the

665
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,594
说K是凸集但现在我有
said K to be convex set but now I have

666
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,965
往往更多地看待对方
to look at the other often more

667
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,584
这个问题的重要部分是什么
important part of the problem what's the

668
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:11,765
功能我正在最小化，我在寻找
function I'm minimizing and I'm looking

669
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,074
对于这种类型的函数
for functions with this kind of a

670
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,895
图片没关系
picture okay

671
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,915
最酷的方式是连接
the coolest way is to connect the

672
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,235
凸函数的定义
definition of a convex function to the

673
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,064
这是凸集的定义
definition of a convex set this is

674
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,165
这是最好的方式
really the nicest way it's a little

675
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,614
快速它只是由你切换，但告诉
quick it just switches by you but tell

676
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,655
我，你看到一个凸集
me do you see a convex set in that

677
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:42,545
图片中你看到了一个凸集
picture you see a convex set in that

678
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,035
图片这是一个图的图片
picture that's the picture of a graph of

679
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,045
凸函数它是a的图片
a convex function it's a picture of a

680
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,165
碗是那个表面上的点
bowl is are the points on that surface

681
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,745
是一个凸集肯定不是
is that a convex set no certainly not

682
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:59,885
没有，但在哪里可以找到凸集
no but where is a convex set to be found

683
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:08,465
在那张照片中是的是积分
here in that picture yes yes the points

684
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:12,185
在碗里面和上面的里面
on and above the bowl the in inside the

685
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:17,395
碗，我们可以说这些点是如此凸起
bowl we could say these points so convex

686
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,045
功能我是一个功能时，凸
function me yes a functions convex when

687
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:33,275
图表上方和上方的点
the points on and above the graph

688
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:48,705
我们的凸集是的，这就是你
our our convex set yeah this is you

689
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,045
我的数学家可以说好吗
could say okay math my mathematicians

690
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,175
只是懒得有一个
are just being lazy having got one

691
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,125
定义直凸说
definition straight for a convex said

692
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,645
现在他们只是用它来给出一个
now they're just using that to give an

693
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,075
容易定义凸函数
easy definition of a convex function

694
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,095
实际上它是功能非常有用
actually it's quite useful for functions

695
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,585
这可能等于无穷大
that could maybe equal infinity sort of

696
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,435
一般的广义函数，但它
general generalized functions but it's

697
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,365
不要告诉我们，如果最快的方法
not the quickest way to tell if the

698
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,125
功能是凸的，这不是我们平常的
function is convex it's not our usual

699
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,755
测试凸函数所以现在我想要
test for convex function so now I want

700
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,235
现在我给这样的测试好了
to give such a test okay so now I

701
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:35,435
凸函数的定义平滑
definition of convex function smooth

702
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,835
是的，这个事实不要急于求成
yeah yeah the the this fact don't rush

703
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:49,275
在俄罗斯关闭远离它从从
in Russia off away from it from the from

704
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,645
凸函数的定义为
the definition of a convex function as

705
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,495
在其图形上方具有凸集
having a convex set above its graph

706
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,135
这里有一个非常官方的法国名字
there's a really official French name

707
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,745
对于上面说的那个图是
for that said above the graph is the

708
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:06,585
题词还好，因为我为什么回来
epigraph okay because why do I come back

709
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,955
那一分钟，因为我愿意
to that for a minute because I would

710
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,015
想想F1的两个功能
like to think about two functions F 1

711
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,985
我可以用两个函数中的F2
and F 2 out of two functions I can

712
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:22,235
始终创建最小值或最大值
always create the minimum or the maximum

713
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,745
所以我想我有两个凸函数
so I suppose I have two convex functions

714
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:33,805
凸函数F1和F2
convex functions F 1 and F 2

715
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:38,095
好吧那我可以选择最小的我
okay then I could choose the minimum I

716
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,675
可以选择我的新功能应我
could choose my new function shall i

717
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,975
称它为m，最小M为X.
call it little m for minimum M of X is

718
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:51,815
最小的f1和f2，我可以
the minimum of f1 and f2 and I could

719
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,905
选择这将是一个最大的功能
choose a maximum function which would be

720
00:47:54,910 --> 00:48:00,605
X的f1和X的f2的最大值
the maximum of f1 of X and f2 of X at

721
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,355
同一点X，如果我只是一个
the same point X if I it's just a

722
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,295
自然的东西好吧我有两个功能
natural thing okay I have two functions

723
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,885
我有一个碗，我还有另一个
I've got a bowl and I've got another

724
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:18,125
碗，并假设它们都是凸起的
bowl and suppose they're both convex so

725
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,625
我只是在这里伸展你的东西
I'm just stretching you the thing here

726
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,715
如果我有，我有两张图
if I've got I've got the graphs of two

727
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,195
凸函数，我想
convex functions and I would like to

728
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,595
考虑这两者中的最小值
consider the minimum of those two

729
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,145
功能以及最大功能
functions and also the maximum of those

730
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,665
我相信你知道生活的两个功能
two functions I believe you know life is

731
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,755
好的其中一个将是凸的和
good one of these will be convex and the

732
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,565
其他不会，你能辨别哪个
other won't and can you identify which

733
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,115
一个是凸的，哪一个不是
one is convex and which one is not

734
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:49,445
凸起最小的是a
convex what about the minimum is that a

735
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,575
凸函数所以只看一下
convex function so just look at the

736
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,645
图表最小化的样子
graph what does the minimum look like

737
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,275
最小的是这个家伙，直到他们见面
the minimum is this guy until they meet

738
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,185
某种程度上在某种程度上然后这个
somehow on some surface and then this

739
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,095
家伙是我们喜欢的凸起
guy is that convex we have like one

740
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,635
分钟回答这个问题
minute to answer that question

741
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,305
绝对不会有这个糟糕的纠结
absolutely no it's got this bad kink in

742
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,995
关于它的最大的两个是什么
it what about the maximum of the two

743
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,755
函数，所以最大的是那个
functions so the maximum is the one that

744
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,725
它首先是所有要点
it's above all the all the points that

745
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,785
是或在上面或上面的东西
are or things that are above or on on

746
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:26,285
那里有那里的
the there there's the there's the

747
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,715
最小功能是最小的
maximum function that was the minimum

748
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,075
功能它最大扭结
function it had a kink the maximum

749
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,065
功能就是这样，它是凸的
function is like that and it is convex

750
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:40,155
所以最大的是
so maximum yes

751
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:47,035
至少知道，如果我们，我们可以最大化
minimum know and we could max if we

752
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,005
最多可以有1500个功能
could have a maximum of 1500 functions

753
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:53,785
如果1500个函数都是凸的
if the 1500 functions are all convex the

754
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,975
最大的将是因为它是部分
maximum will be because it's the part

755
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,305
每个人的图表以上的方式
way above everybody everybody's graph

756
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:02,815
这将是图表
and that would be the graph of the

757
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,825
最好还好
maximum okay good

758
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:10,645
现在终于让我只说怎么办
and now finally let me just say how do

759
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,595
你知道函数是否是凸的
you know whether a function is convex

760
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:19,635
如何测试切斯特
how to test out of Chester

761
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,555
好的，所以让我只是一个功能
okay so let me take just a function of

762
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,855
一个变量是什么测试你
one variable what's what's the test you

763
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,614
学习微积分新生微积分
learn in calculus freshman calculus

764
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:35,125
实际上只是表明这是一个凸起的
actually just show that this is a convex

765
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,585
功能什么是什么是测试为
function what's what's the test for that

766
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,405
二阶导数应为正数或
second derivative should be positive or

767
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:48,825
可能为零所以二阶导数
possibly zero so second derivative

768
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,364
更大等于零无处不在
greater equals zero everywhere

769
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:58,995
这是凸出的最后问题
that's this convex okay final question

770
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,535
假设F是一个向量，所以这是一个
suppose F is a vector so this is a

771
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,364
向量，所以我有n个n函数
vector and so I have n functions of n

772
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:10,765
变量不，我没有
variable no I don't have one

773
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:14,725
抱歉，我有一个功能，但我在n
sorry I've got one function but I'm in n

774
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:21,565
变量，以便使这只是一个
variables so so this was just one that

775
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:27,655
什么是凸性的测试是的呢
what's the test for convexity yes so it

776
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,045
将通过例如x1传递
would be passed for example by x1

777
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,695
平方加上x2平方就可以了
squared plus x2 squared would it be

778
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,695
通过所以这里将是问题
passed by so here would be the question

779
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,925
是否会通过X转置一些
would it be passed by X transpose some

780
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,995
对称矩阵F将是一个
symmetric matrix F that would be a

781
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,505
这是纯二次的二次方
quadratic the pure quadratic would it be

782
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,885
凸
convex

783
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:57,605
这将是测试它有我
what would be the test it's got I'm

784
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,215
寻找一个n维等价物
looking for an n-dimensional equivalent

785
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,505
正二阶导数的
of positive second derivative the

786
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,425
n维等价的正面
n-dimensional equivalent of positive

787
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,855
二阶导数是凸性和我们
second derivative is convexity and we

788
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,435
想要它我们必须认识到它是什么
want it we have to recognize what's the

789
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,805
测试所以我可以应用它
test so I could apply it to this

790
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,475
功能或我可以将它应用于任何
function or I could apply it to any

791
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:28,445
n个变量的功能好吧什么的
function of n variables okay what's the

792
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,845
在这里测试我有一个矩阵代替
test here here I have a matrix instead

793
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:36,035
一个数字，那么什么是好的
of a number so what's what's a good

794
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,165
要求是x出是的
requirement going to be x out yeah

795
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,385
正定或半定或
positive definite or semi definite or

796
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,205
就像这里一样半确定是的
semi definite just as here yeah so the

797
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:52,885
测试是正半确定是的
test is positive semi definite yes yes

798
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,555
这里黑森州实际上是
and here the Hessian is actually that is

799
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,165
因为二阶导数会
because the second derivatives will

800
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,855
第二个产生输出1/2
produce output 1/2 in there the second

801
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,615
衍生物将产生相等的
derivatives will produce s equal the

802
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,515
HessianH所以这里的S如此积极
Hessian H so this here the S so positive

803
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,375
半定的Hessian一般第二
semi definite Hessian in general second

804
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,215
二次方的导数矩阵
derivative matrix for for a quadratic

805
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,415
好吧那么那些凸出的问题
okay so so those it's convex problems

806
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,375
那我们要走得更远的地方
that where we're going to get farther

807
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:31,385
我们跑进去没有马鞍点
with we run into no saddle points we run

808
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:34,955
一旦我们找到了，就没有当地最低限度
into no local minimum once we found the

809
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,085
至少这是全球最低限度
minimum it's the global minimum these

810
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,265
好的问题好吧再好开心
are the good problems okay again happy

811
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,030
to see you today and I look forward to

812
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:44,670
看你今天和我期待着

813
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,670
星期三
