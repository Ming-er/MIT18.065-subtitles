00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:29,175
好吧，让我先左起点吧
okay let me make a start on the left you

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,705
看今天的话题，我们正在做
see the topic for today so we're doing

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,915
很好，这完成了我的那种
pretty well this completes my sort of

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,015
回顾线性的亮点
review of the highlights of linear

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,425
代数所以这是五个讲座和它
algebra so that's five lectures and it

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,175
我将跟进这五点
I'll follow up on those five points

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,805
因为整洁的部分真的很紧密
because the neat part is it really ties

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,305
我可以把整个主题放在一起
together the whole subject I can values

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:01,085
能量a转置决定因素的枢纽
energy a transpose a determinants pivots

18
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,815
他们都聚在一起每个人都给了一个
they all come together each one gives a

19
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,605
试验正定矩阵，从而
test for positive definite matrices so

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,555
所有这些我要清楚的是
all that's where I'm going clear is

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,974
希望进入一点点
hoping to come in for a little bit of

22
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,085
要问是否有人已经开始的课程
the class to ask if anybody has started

23
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,825
在功课上，得到了朱莉娅
on the on the homework and got Julia

24
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,205
滚动并从汽车获得了肯定
rolling and got a yes from the auto

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:36,335
平地机任何人都没有
grader did anybody is anybody like no

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,325
你正抓住朱莉娅的机会
you're taking a chance right Julia in

27
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,985
原则有效但在实践中却是有效的
principle works but in practice it's

28
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,345
我们第一次总是冒险
always an adventure the first time so we

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,665
选择这个实验室进行卷积，因为它
chose this lab on convolution because it

30
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,425
是去年最后一次实验室
was the first lab last time last year

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,415
并且它不为太多质量要求不惜一切
and it doesn't ask for much mass at all

32
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,995
真的只是创建一个矩阵和
really just creating a matrix and

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,575
让自动分级员说是的
getting the auto grader to say yes

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:11,234
那是正确的矩阵所以我们会看到
that's the right matrix so and we'll see

35
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,134
那个矩阵
that matrix

36
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,475
我们会看到这种卷积的想法
we'll see this idea of convolution

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,425
在正确的时间适当的时间
in the right time at the right time

38
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,965
这是不是远其信号
which is not that far off its signal

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,435
处理，它在第三部分的早期
processing and it's early in part three

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,605
这本书好吧，如果克莱尔来了
of the book okay so that if Claire comes

41
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,275
她会回答我的问题
in she'll answer questions otherwise I

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,155
猜它会通过电子邮件发送问题
guess it would be emailing questions to

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,475
我意识到截止日期还没有开始
I realize that the deadline is not on

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,685
你最重要的是你有一个完整的
top of you so and you've got a whole

45
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,865
周末让朱莉娅飞得好
weekend to make Julia fly alright so

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,615
我会从数学开始，然后我们开始
I'll start on the math then we had

47
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,564
对称矩阵我可以的值
symmetric matrix I can values of

48
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,665
矩阵，特别对称
matrices and specially symmetric

49
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,574
矩阵和那些具有真实特征值的矩阵
matrices and those have real eigenvalues

50
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,655
我会很快说明原因和正交
and I'll quickly show why and orthogonal

51
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,115
特征向量，我会很快说明原因
eigenvectors and I'll quickly show why

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,445
但我想转向新的想法
but I want to move to the new idea

53
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,965
正定矩阵所以这些是
positive definite matrices so these are

54
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,234
那里最好的对称矩阵
the best of the symmetric matrices there

55
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,215
是具有对称矩阵
are symmetric matrices that have

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,215
正特征值这是简单的方法
positive eigenvalues that's the easy way

57
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,915
记住正定矩阵
to remember positive definite matrices

58
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,005
他们有正特征值，但它是
they have positive eigenvalues but it's

59
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,405
当然不是我测试的简单方法
certainly not the easy way to test if I

60
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,044
给你一个像那样好的矩阵
give you a matrix like that well that's

61
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,204
我们实际上只能找到两两个
only two by two we could actually find

62
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,965
特征值，但我们想
the eigenvalues but we would like to

63
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,445
有其他测试更容易测试哪些
have other tests easier tests which

64
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,145
将是相当于a
would be which would be equivalent to a

65
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,294
正特征值等等这些其他
positive eigenvalues so these other

66
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,544
这五个测试中的每一个测试中的任何一个
every one of those five tests any one of

67
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,445
这五项测试就是你所需要的
those five tests is is all you need so

68
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,195
让我从这个例子开始，然后问
let me start with that example and ask

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,324
你看，然后我会讨论
you to look and then I'm gonna discuss

70
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,435
那五个不同点，但你能
those five separate points but can you

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,775
好吧，我的问题是矩阵s
see well my question is is that matrix s

72
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,354
它显然是对称的，它是积极的
it's obviously symmetric is it positive

73
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,044
确定或不好，所以你可以
definite or not okay so you could

74
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,055
计算它的特征值，因为它是两个
compute its eigenvalues since it's two

75
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,544
两点它的能量我会回到那个
by two its energy I'll come back to that

76
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,134
因为那是最重要的一个
because that's the most important one

77
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,585
第二是真正的基本数字
number two is really fundamental number

78
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,045
三个人会要求你把它考虑好
three would ask you to factor that well

79
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,915
那就是你没有
that's you don't

80
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,555
花时间与你做什么你
to take time with that well what do you

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,285
认为是正定或不是我
think is it positive definite or not I

82
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,425
看到前排专家说没有
see a expert in the front row saying no

83
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,805
为什么没有答案就是没有
and why is it no the answer is no that's

84
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,055
不是一个肯定的矩阵在哪里
not a positive definite matrix where

85
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,575
是不是让我们失望了
does it let us down it's got all

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,285
积极的数字，但那不是什么
positive numbers but that's not what

87
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,625
我们要问的是我们要求积极的
we're asking we're asking positive

88
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,755
特征值正决定因子
eigenvalues positive determinants

89
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,375
积极的枢纽所以它如何让我们
positive pivots so how does it let us

90
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,435
很好，这是容易测试
down well which which is the easy test

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,515
看到它失败决定了
to see that it fails determinant the

92
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,355
决定因素是15-16，所以负面和
determinant is 15-16 so negative and

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,395
这就是确定的方式
that's what so how's the determinate

94
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,895
连接到每个人的特征值
connected to the eigenvalues everybody

95
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,255
是的，这是两个产品
yep it's the product so the two

96
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,655
它们的特征值当然是真实的
eigenvalues of s they're real of course

97
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,235
他们乘给予
and they multiply to give the

98
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,295
决定因素是负一个这样的一个
determinant which is minus one so one of

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,705
他们是消极的，其中一个是
them is negative and one of them is

100
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,735
积极的这个矩阵是不确定的
positive this matrix is an indefinite

101
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,005
矩阵不确定所以我怎么能做到
matrix indefinite so how could I make it

102
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,585
肯定的好，我们可以
positive definite okay just we can just

103
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,975
玩一个例子，然后我们看到
play with an example and then we see

104
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,835
发生这些事情让我们看得很清楚
these things happening let's see okay

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,845
还有什么我应该把在地方的
well what shall I put in in place of the

106
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,985
例如，我可以降低四个
five for example I could lower the four

107
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,345
或者我可以提升五个或三个我
or I can up the five or up the three I

108
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,865
如果我添加，可以做对角线条目
can make the diagonal entries if I add

109
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,835
东西到主要的对角线我正在制作它
stuff to the main diagonal I'm making it

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,295
更积极的是这样的
more positive so that's sort of

111
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,905
简单的方法以何种号码
straightforward way so what number in

112
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,405
那将是安全的六个好的六个会
there would be safe six okay six would

113
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,855
是安全的，如果我去了5〜6我有
be safe if I go up from five to six I've

114
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,465
当我在这里说时，所以必须这样做
got to do yeah so when I say here

115
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,465
主导决定因素是什么意思
leading determinants what does that mean

116
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,585
这所以这是一个这个词主要手段
that so that's a that word leading means

117
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,525
这意味着我拿一个
something it means that I take the one

118
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,625
一个决定因素它必须通过
by one determinant it would have to pass

119
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,595
那只是决定因素本身
that just the determinant itself would

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,155
不要这样让我举个例子
not do it let me give you an example

121
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,475
4号让我减3和减6
no.4 let me take minus 3 and minus 6

122
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,955
那将具有相同的决定因素但是
that would have the same determinant but

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,115
它写的决定因素仍然存在
it's write the determinant would still

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,665
是18减16-但它没有通过测试
be 18 minus 16 - but it fails the tests

125
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,445
在一个接一个，这通过
on the on the one by one and this passes

126
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,115
这通过逐个测试和
this passes the one by one test and the

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,975
两个两个测试，这就是这个
two by two tests so that's what this

128
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,995
意味着这里的主要决定因素来自
means here leading determinants are from

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,515
左上角你必须检查结束
the upper left you have to check end

130
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,375
事情，因为你有n个特征值
things because you've got n eigenvalues

131
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,395
那些是最终的测试权利和
and those are the end tests right and

132
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,495
你注意到了连接吗？
have you noticed the connection to

133
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,025
枢纽所以让我们记住这一点
pivots so let's just remember that small

134
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,245
项目是什么将成为枢纽，因为我们
item what would be the pivots because we

135
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,675
没有花很长时间消除
didn't take a long time on elimination

136
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,655
所以这将是针对该枢轴
so what would be the pivots for for that

137
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,905
矩阵344秒井是什么的
matrix 3 4 4 second well what's the

138
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,775
第一枢轴3坐在那里11
first pivot 3 sitting there the 1 1

139
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,505
入口将是第一个枢轴所以
entry would be the first pivot so the

140
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:56,085
枢轴将是3，第二个是什么
pivots will be 3 and what's the second

141
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,995
转好，或许可以清楚地看到你
pivot well maybe to see it clearly you

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,785
希望我采取消除步骤
want me to take that elimination step

143
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,455
为什么我不这样做，所以你会看到它
why don't I do it just so you'll see it

144
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,445
这样消除会减去一些
here so elimination would subtract some

145
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,115
从连续两个II行一个的多个
multiple of Row one from Row two I I

146
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,995
我会留下第一排
would leave Row one alone I would

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,005
减去一些倍数得到零
subtract some multiple to get a zero

148
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,195
那里有什么是多重的
there and what what's the multiple

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,535
什么是4/3的乘数
what's the multiplier in that was 4/3

150
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,215
4/3次离第二排一排
4/3 times Row one away from Row two

151
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,695
将产生0但是4的4/3倍
would produce that 0 but 4/3 times the 4

152
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,445
这将是16分之三，我们是
that would be 16 thirds and we're

153
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,594
从我认为减去18分之三
subtracting it from 18 thirds I think

154
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,945
我们有三分之二左右的枢轴
we've got two thirds left so the pivots

155
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,635
这是消除或3
which is this in elimination or the 3

156
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,345
和三分之二，当然他们是
and the 2 thirds and of course they're

157
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,835
积极的，实际上你看到了
positive and actually you see the

158
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,065
立即联系
immediate connection

159
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,944
这个枢轴是2乘2的决定因素
this pivot is the 2 by 2 determinant

160
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:04,905
除以1乘以1的行列式2
divided by the 1 by 1 determinant the 2

161
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,504
通过2个决定因素，我们计算出18-49轴
by 2 determinant we figured out 18-49 ax

162
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:12,675
16是1乘1的决定因素是3
16 was to the 1 by 1 determinant is 3

163
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,064
确定第二个枢轴是2/3
and sure enough that second pivot is 2/3

164
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:27,694
这不是我的例子
this is not so by example I'm

165
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:33,074
说明这些不同的测试
illustrating what these different tests

166
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,064
如果你需要的话，每个测试都是你需要的
and again each test is all you need if

167
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,314
它通过一个测试，它通过它们
it passes one test it passes them all

168
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:41,894
而且我们还没有找到特征值
and and we haven't found the eigenvalues

169
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,834
让我做能量，我可以做能量
let me do the energy can I do energy

170
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,655
这里好吧，我在说什么呢
here okay so what's this I I'm saying

171
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,014
这真是一个伟大的考验
that this is the really the great test

172
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,584
这对我来说就是a的定义
that for me that's the definition of a

173
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,035
正定矩阵和单词
positive definite matrix and the word

174
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,274
能量进来是因为它是二次方的
energy comes in because it's quadratics

175
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,185
远离动能或势能
away kinetic energy or potential energy

176
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,774
这就是向量X中的能量
so that's the energy in the vector X for

177
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,324
这个矩阵让我计算它X.
this matrix so let me compute it X

178
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:18,524
转置X所以让我把它放在这里
transpose X so let me put in s here the

179
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:25,125
原来的，让我投入任何
original s and let me put in an any

180
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,875
向量X所以说XY或X1也许
vector X so say X Y or X 1 maybe

181
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,774
你喜欢XXY更容易吗？
do you like X X Y is easier so that's

182
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,225
这是我们的矢量X转置这是
that's our vector X transpose this is

183
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,595
我们的矩阵s和这里是我们的向量X所以
our matrix s and here's our vector X so

184
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,095
它是x和y的函数，它是纯粹的
it's a function of x and y it's a pure

185
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,704
您知道二次函数吗？
quadratic function can you do you know

186
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,865
当我把它扩散出来时，我得到了什么
what I get when I multiply that out I

187
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,684
得到一个非常简单的重要类型
get I get a very simple important type

188
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:58,024
我们将函数乘以它
of function shall we multiply it out

189
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:00,644
让我们看到，所以我乘以那个
let's see so I multiply that by that

190
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:08,125
首先让我得到3x加4y和4x加6y
first so I get 3x plus 4y and 4x plus 6y

191
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,695
这就是我从这两个中获得的
it's what I'm getting from the these two

192
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,665
而现在我用XY来达到目的
and now I'm hitting that with the X Y

193
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,255
而现在我会看到能量和
and now I'm gonna see the energy and

194
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,265
你会看到永远的模式
you'll see the pattern that's always

195
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,085
什么是数学是什么样的模式
what math is about what's the pattern so

196
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,575
我有x倍3x3x平方+iyx6y
I have x times 3x 3x squared + iy x 6y

197
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,165
这是6平方米，我有x倍4y
that's 6 y square and I have x times 4y

198
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,175
那是4XYz--+iy乘以4x的
that's 4 XY z-- + iy times 4x that's for

199
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,625
更多XY，所以我得到了所有这些条款
more XY so I've got all those terms

200
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,165
每个数字中的每个术语
every every term in every number in the

201
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,885
矩阵给了我一块能量
matrix gives me a piece of the energy

202
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,355
你看到对角线数字3
and you see that the diagonal numbers 3

203
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,615
＆6那些给我对角线3x
& 6 those give me the diagonal pieces 3x

204
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,935
平方+6平方，然后是地壳
squared + 6 y squared and then the crust

205
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,765
但我可能称他们为交叉术语
but I maybe call them the cross terms

206
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,205
那些给我4XY+4XY所以真的是8X.
those give me 4 XY + 4 XY so really 8 X

207
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:19,305
Y所以你可以称这个东西为8XY
Y so so you could call this thing 8 X Y

208
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,855
这就是我的功能
so that's my function that's my

209
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,335
二次方是我的能量而且我相信
quadratic that's my energy and I believe

210
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,675
大于0的那个让我图
that that is greater than 0 let me graph

211
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,894
让我画出能量的东西
the thing let me graph that energy

212
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:41,624
好的，所以这是我的功能f的图表
okay so here's a graph of my function f

213
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:47,894
这里的x和y是X，这里是y和
of x and y here is X and here is y and

214
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,384
当然那是在图上
of course that's on the graph

215
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:54,524
零等于零等于零等于零
zero zero at x equals zero y equals zero

216
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,374
每个人的功能显然都是零
the function is clearly zero everybody's

217
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,084
得到他的眼睛让我写出这个功能
got his eye let me write that function

218
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:08,764
再次在这里3x平方6y平方8XY.
again here 3 x squared 6 y squared 8 X Y

219
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,314
实际上你可以看到这就是我的想法
actually you can see this is how I think

220
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,725
关于那个功能如此3x平方
about that that function so 3x squared

221
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,155
显然是把我抬高了
is obviously carrying me upwards it's

222
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,544
不是它永远不会消极的6y平方
not it never goes negative 6y squared

223
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,444
永远不会消极8XY可以去
will never go negative 8 X Y can go

224
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,684
如果x和y相反则为负
negative right if x and y have opposite

225
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:33,465
迹象表明这将是负面的，但是
signs that that will go negative but the

226
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,514
这些问题是做这些积极的
question is do these do these positive

227
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,355
碎片压倒它并制作图表
pieces overwhelm it and make the graph

228
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:51,014
像碗一样上升，答案是肯定的
go up like a bowl and the answer is yes

229
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,864
对于正定矩阵这样
for a positive definite matrix so this

230
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,934
是正定矩阵的图
is a graph of a positive definite matrix

231
00:13:55,939 --> 00:14:00,134
能量的一部分正能量
of a part of positive energy the energy

232
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,624
一个正定矩阵所以这是
of a positive definite matrix so this is

233
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,794
能量X转置FX我是
the energy X transpose F X that I'm

234
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,564
图表就在那里
graph and there it is

235
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:14,715
这一点非常重要
this is important this is important this

236
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,144
是我们喜欢X的功能
is the kind of function we like X

237
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,304
转置X，其中s是正定的
transpose X where s is positive definite

238
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:26,024
所以功能就像这样
so the function goes up like that this

239
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,664
深学习是这个什么
is what deep learning is about this

240
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,784
可能是你的损失功能
could be a loss function that you that

241
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,524
你最小化它可能取决于一个
you minimize it could depend on a

242
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:37,774
十万个变量或更多
hundred thousand variables or more and

243
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:43,424
它可能来自于错误
it could come from the the error in the

244
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:47,264
训练数据和
difference between training data and

245
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,635
您的
your

246
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,095
而你得到的损失数字将是
and the number you get the loss would be

247
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,704
这样的一些表达好，我会让
some expression like that well I'll make

248
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,324
我能尽快感受到这些话语
sense of those words as soon as I can

249
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:09,454
我想说的是深度学习
what I want to say is deep learning

250
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,524
神经网络机器学习了
neural Nets machine learning that the

251
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,635
大的计算是最小化能量
big computation is to minimize an energy

252
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,725
我当然要尽量减少能量
is to minimize an energy now of course I

253
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,024
因为我，所以最容易找到
made the minimum easy to find because I

254
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,545
有纯正的方块
have pure squares

255
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,524
也不会在实践发生
well that doesn't happen in practice of

256
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,905
在实践中，我们有线性术语
course in practice we have linear terms

257
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,865
X转移B或非线性是的损失
X transpose B or nonlinear yeah the loss

258
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,715
功能不一定是一件事
function doesn't have to be a thing

259
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,445
那里交叉熵各种各样的东西
cross-entropy all kinds of things there

260
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,115
有一整本可能的字典
there's a whole dictionary of possible

261
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,704
损失功能，但这是模型
loss functions but but this is the model

262
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,285
这是模型，我会成功的
this is the model and I'll make it the

263
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,485
只关注那个完美的模型
perfect model by just focusing on that

264
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:05,144
在那一部分是好的，顺便说一下
on that part well yeah by the way what

265
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,935
什么会创造会发生什么
what what would create what would happen

266
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,615
如果那是在那里我不应该
if that was in there I shouldn't have

267
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,735
因为我离开这么快就离开了
exited out so so well so quickly since I

268
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,715
把它放在那里让我把它放回去
just put it up there let me put it back

269
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,315
向上
up

270
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,485
我看得更清楚了
I saw it better rather okay

271
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,584
这是最小方块
this is the kind of least squares

272
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:28,084
一些数据的问题是最小化
problem with some data be minimize that

273
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,975
那么这个家伙的图表是什么？
so what would be the graph of this guy

274
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,595
我可以画出同样的画面
can I just draw the same sort of picture

275
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,795
对于那个功能，它是一个碗是的
for that function will it be a bowl yes

276
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,024
如果我有这个学期所有所做的是
if I have this term all that does is

277
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:51,105
在x等于0时将其移离中心
move it off center here at x equals 0

278
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,595
好吧，我仍然得到0抱歉我还是去
well I still get 0 sorry I still go

279
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,694
通过这一点，如果这是零
through that point if this is the zero

280
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,215
矢量我仍然会得到0，但这会
vector I'm still getting 0 but this will

281
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,045
把它带到那个会那样的
bring it below that would that would

282
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,715
生产一个像它实际上的碗
produce a bowl like that actually it

283
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,315
就是这样
would just be

284
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,395
碗也是一样的碗
same Bowl the bowl is would just be

285
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,694
转移我可以写那个来表明如何
shifted I could write that to show how

286
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:13,545
发生这种情况现在就是这样
that happens so this is this is now

287
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,395
零度以下就是这个
below zero this is the that's the

288
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,505
我们追求的解决方案
solution we're after

289
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,525
这告诉我们神经元的权重
that tells us the weights in the neural

290
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,465
网络我只是用这些词而已
network I'm just using these words but

291
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,545
我很快就会对他们有意义
will soon have a meaning to them I want

292
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,675
用其他的话来找到最小值
to find that minimum in other words and

293
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,565
我想找到更多
I want to find it for much more

294
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,545
复杂的功能比
complicated functions than that of

295
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,945
当然，如果我最小化二次方
course if I minimize a quadratic that

296
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,945
意味着将衍生物设置为零
means setting derivatives to zero I just

297
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,005
我可以使用线性方程式
have linear equations probably I can I

298
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,465
可以为此写下所有内容
could write everything down for that for

299
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,475
那件事让我们加入一些
that thing so let's put in some

300
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,775
摇摆不定的非线性东西
nonlinear stuff which which wiggles the

301
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,015
碗让它变得不那么容易
bowl makes it not so easy

302
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,655
我能提前一个月看你怎么找到的
can I look a month ahead how do you find

303
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,165
所以这是数学的重要组成部分
so this is a big part of mathematics

304
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:10,005
应用数学优化最小化
applied math optimization minimization

305
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,975
一百个复杂功能
of a complicated function of a hundred

306
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,085
千变量是最大的
thousand variables that's the biggest

307
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,765
计算是机器的原因
computation that's the reason machine

308
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,225
学习大问题需要一周的时间
learning on big problems takes a week on

309
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,605
一个GPU或多个GPU，因为你有
a GPU or multiple GPUs because you have

310
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,925
如此多的未知数将超过100000
so many unknowns more than 100000 would

311
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,585
一般来说很正常
be quite normal in general let's just

312
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,165
有展望未来的快乐
have the pleasure of looking ahead for

313
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,495
一分钟后我会回来的
one minute and then I'll come back to

314
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,285
这里的实际生活线性代数是的
real life here linear algebra yeah just

315
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:49,185
我无法抗拒你如何大声思考
I can't resist thinking aloud how do you

316
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,845
通过这些方式找到最小值
find the minimum by the way these

317
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,275
这两个函数都是凸的
functions both of them are convex so

318
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,054
那是凸的
that is convex

319
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,744
所以我想连接凸函数F.
so I want to connect convex functions F

320
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:12,484
什么是凸意味着它意味着什么
and what does convex mean it means well

321
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:18,835
我的意思是图表是这样的
that the graph is like that yeah I mean

322
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,335
不完美它可以，但如果是的话
not perfect it could it could but if if

323
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,214
它是一个二次的凸面式
it's a quadratic then convex means

324
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:32,904
肯定的，也可能是
positive definite or maybe in the

325
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:36,214
极端正半明确我会
extreme positive semi-definite I'll have

326
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:40,984
提到是的但是凸出来
to mention that yeah but but convex

327
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:42,994
意味着它上升但它可能有
means it goes up but it could have

328
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,114
摆动它不一定是公正的
Wiggles it doesn't have to be just

329
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,274
完美的正方形和线性项但是
perfect squares and linear terms but

330
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,874
一般事物和深度学习
general things and for for deep learning

331
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:56,254
它将包括没有它将远远超出
it will include none it'll go far beyond

332
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:00,394
正方形，但它可能不是凸的
quadratics but well it may not be convex

333
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:05,195
我想这也是真的，是的，所以如此深刻
I guess that's also true yeah so so deep

334
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,565
学习有严重的问题
learning has got serious problems

335
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,744
因为他们可能看起来那些功能
because those functions they may look

336
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,054
像这样，但随后在这里，他们可以
like this but then over here they could

337
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,315
你知道他们可以蘸不凸
go you know non convex they could dip

338
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,174
多一点，你正在寻找
down a little more and you're looking

339
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:24,994
对于这一点或仍然这一点
for this point or for this point still

340
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,825
我决心告诉你如何找到
I'm determined to tell you how to find

341
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,894
它是如此，或者从如何找到它开始
it so or a start on how you find it so

342
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,644
你在某些时候有合适的遗憾
you're at some point there right sorry

343
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:41,584
从这个表面的某个地方开始
start there somewhere on this surface

344
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,424
一些X某些矢量X是你的开始
some X some some vector X is your start

345
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:52,234
x0开始，我们将采取
x0 starting and we're going to just take

346
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:58,144
希望能顺利地沿着碗向下迈出一步
a step hopefully down down the bowl well

347
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,004
当然，这将是非常美妙采取
of course it would be fantastic to take

348
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,705
一步到那，但事实并非如此
to get there in one step but that's not

349
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,935
会发生什么，这将是
going to happen that that would be

350
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,404
解决一个大的线性系统
solving a big linear system very

351
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:11,344
昂贵且非常大的非线性系统
expensive and a big nonlinear system so

352
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:13,144
真的，这就是我们想要解决的问题
really that's what we're trying to solve

353
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:16,084
我应该是一个很大的非线性系统
a big nonlinear system and I should be

354
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,585
喜欢这张照片
like on this picture

355
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,015
因为在这里我们可以看到
because here we can see where the

356
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,404
最小但是他们只是改变了
minimum is but they just shift so what

357
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,865
如果你有一个起点，你会这样做吗？
would you do if you had a starting point

358
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,585
你想去寻找
and you wanted to go look for the

359
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,135
最小但是什么是自然的想法
minimum but what's the natural idea

360
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,085
计算衍生物
compute derivatives

361
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,215
你已经计算了微积分
you've got calculus on your side compute

362
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,965
第一个衍生品是第一个
the first derivatives so the first

363
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,774
关于X的衍生物，所以我
derivatives with respect to X so so I

364
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,595
会计算F的导数
would compute the derivative of F with

365
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,265
关于X和F的导数
respect to X and the derivative of F

366
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,385
关于Y和十万
with respect to Y and hundred thousand

367
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,135
更多，这需要一点时间
more and that takes a little while and

368
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,075
现在我有衍生物，我该怎么做
now I've got the derivatives what do I

369
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,304
我去的那个告诉我最陡的
do I go that tells me the steepest

370
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:09,125
在那一点告诉我的方向
direction that tells me at that point

371
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,355
哪条路最快，所以我愿意
which way is fastest way down so I would

372
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,904
按照我会做一个梯度下降我
follow I would do a gradient descent I

373
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,034
将遵循梯度，这是
would follow that gradient this is

374
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:21,125
所谓梯度所有第一
called the gradient all the first

375
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,065
衍生物称为F的梯度
derivatives is called the gradient of F

376
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:31,085
梯度梯度向量是a
the gradient gradient vector it's a

377
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,034
矢量当然因为F是一个函数
vector of course because F is a function

378
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,274
我会从很多变量开始
of lots of variables I would start down

379
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:42,024
在这个方向和能走多远
in that direction and how far to go

380
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,914
这就像百万美元的问题
that's like the million dollar question

381
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,365
在深度学习中，就像在它的时候一样
in in deep learning as when it is it is

382
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:54,845
它会打到零不，这不是不是
it gonna hit zero nope it's not it's not

383
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:01,475
所以你基本上你去，直到
and so you basically you go down until

384
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,554
直到他们进去，所以你在旅行
it until they go in so you're traveling

385
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:08,945
这里是沿着渐变的X和
here in the X along the gradient and

386
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,855
你是不是你不会
you're you're not even you're not gonna

387
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,924
零点你是对的你一切都好
hit zero you're right you're all going

388
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:16,475
在某个方向，你想要
here in some direction and you want to

389
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,315
去吧，你继续这件事
go so you keep going down this thing

390
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,115
直到它哦，我在这里不是伦勃朗
until it oh my I'm not Rembrandt here

391
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,534
我想你的路径就在那里
I'm there your path down think of

392
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:30,945
你自己在山上
yourself on a mountain

393
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,945
你正试图走下山，所以你采取
you're trying to go downhill so you take

394
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,525
尽你所能，所以你拿走了
as fast as you can so you take the

395
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,345
最陡峭的路线直到但是但是
steepest route down until but but but

396
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,255
你有你的有色眼镜只是一旦你
you have blinkers on you just once you

397
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,145
决定你进去的方向
decided on a direction you go in that

398
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,005
当然是方向，所以会是什么
direction of course yeah so so what will

399
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,315
恰巧你可以下去了一会儿，
happen you'll go down for a while and

400
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,424
然后它会再次权当转起来
then it will turn up again right when

401
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:58,255
你得到的排序可能接近
you get sort of maybe close to the

402
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,685
你可能不会去，也可能不是你
bottom or maybe not you you're not going

403
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,895
打到这里，它会错过那个
to hit here and it's gonna miss that and

404
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,025
或许我应该把它画在这里
come up maybe I should draw it over here

405
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:13,135
无论如何，这就是所谓的一条线
whatever so this is it's called a line

406
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,525
激励决定去那里多远
surge to decide how far to go there and

407
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:22,435
然后说好的停止，你可以投资
then say okay stop and you can invest a

408
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,745
很多时间或一点时间来决定
lot of time or a little time to decide

409
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,225
在第一个停止点和现在
on that first stopping point and now

410
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,654
告诉我你下一步做什么
just tell me what do you do next

411
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:36,645
所以现在你现在什么什么在这里
so now you're here what what now

412
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,985
重新计算渐变找到的
recalculate the gradient find the

413
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,065
从那一点开始最陡峭的方式跟随
steepest way down from that point follow

414
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,965
它直到它出现或大约
it until it turns up or approximately

415
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,404
那你就是新的一点，所以这就是
then you're at a new point so this is

416
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:51,205
梯度下降
gradient descent

417
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,325
这是一个梯度下降的大
that's a gradient descent the big

418
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,115
神经网络深度学习算法
algorithm of deep learning of neural

419
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,294
机器学习网很棒
Nets of machine learning great of

420
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,965
优化你可以说注意到
optimization you could say notice that

421
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,145
我们没有计算二阶导数
we didn't compute second derivatives if

422
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,815
如果我们计算二阶导数我们
if we computed second derivatives we

423
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,534
可能有一个更好的公式可以
could have a fancier formula that could

424
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,765
在这里考虑弯曲曲线
account for the bending the curve here

425
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,554
但计算二阶导数时
but to compute second derivatives when

426
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,145
你有成千上万的
you've got hundreds of thousands of

427
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:26,835
变量并不是很有趣
variables is is not a lot of fun so most

428
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,315
有效的机器学习是有限的
effectively machine learning is limited

429
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,525
一阶导数的梯度如此
to first derivatives the gradient so

430
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,765
好的
okay

431
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,245
所以这是一般的想法，但有
so that's the general idea but there are

432
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,784
很多很多的
lots and lots of

433
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:51,394
决定，为什么不那么好
decisions and why doesn't that how well

434
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:52,144
那样有用吗
does that work

435
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,695
也许是好的方式
maybe maybe is a good way to good

436
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,065
要问的问题这个工作很漂亮
question to ask does this work pretty

437
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,945
你知道还是我们必须添加更多
well you know or do we have to add more

438
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,094
这些想法并不总是很有效
ideas well it doesn't always work well

439
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,575
让我告诉你的麻烦是我
let me tell you what the trouble is I

440
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,634
不要这样，我就像这样
don't so I'm Way off of like this is

441
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:20,435
这就像三月或其他东西但是
this is like March or something but

442
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,445
反正我说完这句话有啥
anyway I'll finish the sentence so what

443
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,844
这个渐变有什么问题
what's the problem with this gradient

444
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:31,774
下降的想法，如果你是这样的话
descent idea it it turns out if you're

445
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,024
沿着狭窄的山谷走，我不知道
going down a narrow Valley I don't know

446
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:36,214
如果你可以想象一个狭窄的
if you can sort of imagine a narrow

447
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,754
谷底朝下，所以这里
valley toward the bottom so so here's

448
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,354
这里是这里的底部是你的
here's the here's the bottom here's your

449
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,254
起点，这就是我的意思
starting point and this is so I mean you

450
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,794
不得不认为这是一个碗所以
have to think of this as a bowl so the

451
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,514
是的，碗是两个
yeah the bowl is the were the two

452
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,544
你能说的特征值是一个和一个
eigenvalues you could say are one and a

453
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,904
碗很长很少
very small number the bowl is long and

454
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:02,344
你和我在一起很瘦
thin are you with me

455
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:05,705
想象一个长薄的碗然后是什么
imagine a long thin bowl then what

456
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,244
你采取的情况就是这种情况
happens for that case you you take

457
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:12,124
最陡的血统，但你越过了
steepest descent but you cross the

458
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:14,404
山谷，很快你就会爬山
valley and very soon you're climbing

459
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:17,825
再次让你非常小
again so you take very it's very small

460
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,185
步骤只是来回蹒跚
steps just staggering back and forth

461
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:26,945
穿过这个并且慢慢地但也是如此
across this and getting slowly but too

462
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,274
慢慢向那里的底部那样
slowly toward the bottom there so that's

463
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,804
为什么事情一定是在你改善
why things have got to be improved you

464
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:39,544
如果你有，我可以非常小的价值
can if you have I can value a very small

465
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,945
特征值在一个非常大的特征值
eigenvalue in a very large eigenvalue

466
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,594
那些告诉你碗的形状
those tell you the the shape of the bowl

467
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,565
当然，很多情况都会如此
of course and many cases will will be

468
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,054
我可以这样小而大
like that have a small and a large I can

469
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:56,674
价值，然后你花了你所有的
value and then you're spending all your

470
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:57,335
时间
time

471
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,855
你快速上升到另一边
you're quickly going up the other side

472
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,745
下来向下，你需要一个新的
down up down up down and you need a new

473
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:10,745
想法没关系，所以这就是真的
idea okay so that's really so this is

474
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,415
肯定的一个主要原因
one major reason why positive-definite

475
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,695
是如此重要，因为
is so important because

476
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,105
肯定的给出像
positive-definite gives pictures like

477
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,525
这一点，但接下来我们有这个问题
that but then we have this question of

478
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,595
特征值是否相同
are the eigenvalues sort of the same

479
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,995
当然，如果大小的特征值
size of course if the eigenvalues are

480
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,625
一切都等于我的碗就像我们想的那样
all equal what's my bowl like suppose we

481
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,305
假设我有所有假设
suppose all the suppose I have the

482
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,725
身份使得x平方加y
identity so that's x squared plus y

483
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,605
平方是我的功能然后它是一个
squared is my function then it's a

484
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,635
完美的圆形碗将会发生什么
perfectly circular Bowl what will happen

485
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,615
如果我能想象一个完美的
if I can you imagine a perfectly

486
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,865
圆形像在任何任何碗
circular like any any bowl in the

487
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,545
厨房大概是最有可能的圆形
kitchen is probably most likely circular

488
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,395
并假设我在那里做渐变下降
and suppose I do gradient descent there

489
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,695
我完全从某个方面开始
I start at some point on this perfectly

490
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,595
圆形碗我开始下降，在哪里
circular Bowl I start down and where do

491
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,755
我停在这种情况下，做我触底我做
I stop in that case do I hit bottom I do

492
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,275
通过对称性我会如此，如果我采取x
by symmetry I'm gonna so so if I take x

493
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,115
平方加y平方作为我的函数
squared plus y squared as my function

494
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,035
我从某个地方开始，我弄明白了
and I start somewhere I figure out the

495
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,005
渐变是的答案是我会去的
gradient yeah the answer is I'll go

496
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,675
穿过中心所以真的是这样
right through the center so really it's

497
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,565
正正特征值为正
positive positive eigen values positive

498
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,465
明确的矩阵给我们一个碗，但如果
definite matrices give us a bowl but if

499
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,605
特征值相差很远
the eigenvalues are far apart that's

500
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:45,485
当我们有问题好，我要回去
when we have problems ok I'm going back

501
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:52,085
我的工作是这个名单，因为你
to my job which is this list because you

502
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,775
真的，这太好了
really this is so nice

503
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,775
是的，你可以吗？
yeah right could you

504
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,545
好的功课可能会出去
well the homework that may be going out

505
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,515
这一分钟是下周中旬
this minute for middle of next week

506
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,895
给你一些练习
gives you some exercises

507
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,535
这个让我做了两件事情一
with this let me do a couple of things a

508
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:22,015
例如，这里有几个练习
couple of exercises here for example

509
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,245
假设我有一个积极的不同
suppose I have a positive different

510
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,885
矩阵S和正定矩阵
matrix S and a positive definite matrix

511
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:32,225
如果我添加这些矩阵，则为结果
T if I add those matrices is a result

512
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,285
肯定的，所以有一个完美的
positive definite so there's a perfect

513
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:42,865
数学的问题，我们希望能回答这样
math question and we hope to answer so

514
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:49,625
SMT正定大约为S加什么
SMT positive definite what about s plus

515
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:57,265
T是矩阵正定的好
T is that matrix positive definite okay

516
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,545
我怎么回答这个问题
how do I answer such a question I look

517
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,185
在我的五个测试中，我认为我可以使用
at my five tests and I think can I use

518
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,305
它是什么哪一个会是好的，
it what which one will be good and the

519
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,305
哇和一个不会告诉我太多的是
whoa and one that won't tell me much is

520
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,425
特征值因为特征值
the eigenvalues because the eigen values

521
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,325
s加T不能立即清楚
of s plus T are not immediately clear

522
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,835
来自s和T的特征值
from the eigenvalues of s and T

523
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,565
另外我不想使用那个测试
separately I don't want to use that test

524
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,355
这是我最喜欢的测试，所以我要去
this is my favorite test so I'm going to

525
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,925
用那个能量来解决这个问题
use that what about the energy in so

526
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:34,355
看看能量所以我看看X.
look at the energies so I look at X

527
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,625
转置s加TX和什么是我的
transpose s plus T X and what's my

528
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,745
在我心中的问题是这样的
question in my mind here is that a

529
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,695
每个X和X的正数或不正数
positive number or not for every X and

530
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,585
我怎么回答这个问题
how am I going to answer that question

531
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,355
把这两个分成两部分
just separate those two into two pieces

532
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,355
对，它在我面前就是它
right it's there in front of me it's

533
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,075
这一次这是什么一个和两个
this one what's this one and both of

534
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,205
那些都是积极的，所以答案是肯定的
those are positive so the answer is yes

535
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:14,165
肯定是肯定的
it is positive definite yes

536
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,805
你看到能量如何正确我
you see how the energy just was right I

537
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,625
不想计算枢轴或任何
don't want to compute the pivots or any

538
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,215
决定因素就像一个
determinants that would be like a

539
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,945
噩梦试图找到决定因素
nightmare trying to find determinants

540
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,855
对于s加T但是这个没有
for s plus T but this one just doesn't

541
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,005
什么其他将是一个好的
immediately what else would be a good

542
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,855
例如开始与什么有关他们
example to start with what about their

543
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,415
讽刺诗是肯定肯定的
sin verse is that positive definite yes

544
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,615
肯定的，我想问
positive definite and I want to ask

545
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,165
关于它的逆，所以int逆是a
about its inverse so int inverse is a

546
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:55,125
对称矩阵，它是积极的
symmetric matrix and is it positive

547
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:02,025
肯定和答案是的，我得到了
definite and the answer yes yes I got

548
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,805
五次测试20％的机会挑选
five tests 20% chance of picking the

549
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:11,295
正确的一个决定因素并不好
right one determinants not good the

550
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,645
第一个是伟大的
first one is great

551
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,585
第一个是一个好这个
the first one is the good one for this

552
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,915
问题，因为特征值，因此
question because the eigen values so the

553
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:26,235
回答是是是是这是本征
answer is yes yes yes this is has eigen

554
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,785
因此，s的特征值是多少？
values so what are the eigenvalues of s

555
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:44,585
在lambda逆1，所以是的，没错
inverse 1 over lambda so yes okay right

556
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,775
是的
yep

557
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,745
那是什么，让我再问一个
what about yeah let me ask just one more

558
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,465
同样的问题假设我
question of this same sort suppose I

559
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,715
有一个矩阵s并假设我乘以
have a matrix s and suppose I multiply

560
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,655
它由另一个矩阵哦好吧
it by another matrix oh well okay

561
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:14,235
假设是的，我想是的，我猜想
suppose yeah yep suppose I have suppose

562
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,125
我问过你的另一个矩阵
I asked you about s times another matrix

563
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:24,725
中号
M

564
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,455
那肯定是肯定的
would that be positive definite or not

565
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,605
现在我要告诉你答案了
now I'm gonna tell you the answer the

566
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,435
答案是问题不是
answer is that the question wasn't any

567
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,405
很好，因为那个矩阵可能不是
good because that matrix is probably not

568
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,015
对称的，我只是在处理
symmetric and I'm only dealing with

569
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,835
对称矩阵矩阵必须是
symmetric matrices matrices have to be

570
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,105
在我知道之前，我可以对称
symmetric before I can before I know

571
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,585
他们有真正的特征值，我可以问
they have real eigenvalues and I can ask

572
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,215
这些问题因此不好，但我
these questions so that's not good but I

573
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:58,005
哦，让我看得好，让我听到你
could oh let's see well let me hear ya

574
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,035
让我让我把它放在一个正交的
let me let me put it in an orthogonal

575
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,135
人以及他们仍然认为不是
guy well they're still that's not

576
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,245
对称，但如果我把它的转置
symmetric but if I put C its transpose

577
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,235
然后我就把它对称哦
over there then I made it symmetric oh

578
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,615
亲爱的，我可能会遇到麻烦
dear I may be getting myself in trouble

579
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,035
在这里，我从一个积极的开始
here so I'm starting with a positive

580
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,315
明确的我正在打击
definite s I'm hitting with an

581
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,075
正交矩阵，它的转置和
orthogonal matrix and it's transpose and

582
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,345
我有点直觉地把我带到了这里
I sort of my instinct carried me here

583
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,875
因为我知道那仍然存在
because I know that that's still

584
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,665
对称的权利，如果我，每个人都会看到
symmetric right everybody sees that if I

585
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,515
转置此Q转置将来
transpose this Q transpose will come

586
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,265
在这里是的Q会去那里它会是一些
here yes Q will go there it'll be some

587
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,355
检查对称现在是积极的
checks symmetric now is that positive

588
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:46,695
一定哦，是的，我们不能回答这个问题可以
definite oh yes we can't answer that can

589
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,055
我们
we

590
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,385
这是肯定的，所以记住
is that positive definite so remember

591
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,515
这是一个正交矩阵，所以我
that this is an orthogonal matrix so I'm

592
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,825
如果你想让我写它那么
also if you wanted me to write it that

593
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,365
这样我可以
way I could

594
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:02,115
那些正面的确定性呢？
and what about positive definiteness of

595
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:10,185
那个东西我认为答案是肯定的做
that thing the answer I think is yes do

596
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,205
你同意这是肯定的
you agree it is positive definite give

597
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,355
我有理由为什么这是积极的
me a reason though why is this positive

598
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,715
确定的大，所以这个词很相似
definite big so that word similar so

599
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,735
这是一个与S类似的矩阵
what this is a similar matrix to S do

600
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,385
你还记得类似的意思
you remember what similar means from

601
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,595
上次它意味着一些m及其
last time it means that some m and its

602
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,735
逆或在这里我们
inverse or here we

603
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,235
它们是什么，所以它是什么
they are and so what's the what's the

604
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,425
与我相似的后果
consequence of being similar what do I

605
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,185
知道一个类似于s的矩阵
know about a matrix that's similar to s

606
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,395
它具有相同的特征值和
it has the same eigenvalues and

607
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,225
因此我们很好或者我可以去
therefore we're good right or I could go

608
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,915
通过这种方式，我能为能量做出这样的能量
this way I could energy I like energy so

609
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,465
让我尝试一个X转Q
let me try that one X transpose Q

610
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,235
转换suX即能量
transpose su X that would be the energy

611
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,395
我试图表明我在尝试什么
and what am I trying to show I'm trying

612
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,015
表明它是积极的，所以我当然是
to show it's positive so of course my as

613
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,175
我看到就像等待一样
soon as I see that like just waiting for

614
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,845
我对QX来说可能就是Y
me to the QX be something called Y maybe

615
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,325
那么这将是我的Y.
and then what will this be my Y

616
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:31,614
转移所以这个能量就是这样
transpose so this this energy would be

617
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:37,285
与Y转置相同的Y和什么做
the same as Y transpose s Y and what do

618
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,095
我知道这是积极的，因为
I know about that it's positive because

619
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,915
这是在Y对Y的能量
that's an energy in the Y for the Y

620
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,745
矢量所以这样或那样我们得到了
vector so one way or another we get the

621
00:37:48,750 --> 00:38:02,895
对那个问题回答是，好吧好吧，让我
answer yes to that question ok ok let me

622
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,165
介绍半定的概念
introduce the idea of semi-definite

623
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,955
半定的是边界所以
semi-definite is the borderline so so

624
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,655
我们有什么，我们有三四四
what did we have we had three four four

625
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,025
然后当它五岁时你告诉我
and then when it was five you told me

626
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,064
无限和负特征值时
indefinite and negative eigenvalue when

627
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:23,155
这是六点，你告诉我两个积极的
it was six you told me two positive

628
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,885
特征值确定了什么
eigenvalues definite what's the

629
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,705
边缘
borderline

630
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,094
什么是它的边界不是
what's the borderline there it's not

631
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,584
它不会是一个整数，但它是
it's not going to be an integer but it's

632
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:36,834
那我的意思是什么呢？
well what do I mean what am I looking

633
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:43,495
对于它，边界线是的，所以告诉
for it the borderline well yeah so tell

634
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,824
我再听到十六个以上的声音
me again sixteen over three that sounds

635
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:52,525
对，为什么这是边界因为
right why is that the borderline because

636
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,395
现在决定因素是零，它是单数
now the determinant is zero its singular

637
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,084
它的零特征值为零
it has a zero eigenvalue there's a zero

638
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,364
特征值，这是半定的
eigenvalue so that's what semi definite

639
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:05,545
意味着lambda大于等于零
means lambdas are greater equal to zero

640
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,485
等一下零特征值
wait a minute that has a zero eigenvalue

641
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,794
因为它的决定因素是零如何做
because it's determinant is zero how do

642
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:13,375
我知道另一个特征值是
i know that the other eigenvalue is

643
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,314
这可能是积极的
positive could could the could it be

644
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:20,535
那是另一个所以这是半
that the other right so this is the semi

645
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,235
确定的情况我们希望，但我们更好
definite case we hope but we better

646
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,765
完成那个推理我怎么知道
finish that reasoning how do I know that

647
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,304
另一个特征值是正的
the other eigenvalue is positive the

648
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:36,804
跟踪因为加3加16超过
trace because the adding 3 plus 16 over

649
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,965
3无论可能给它什么
3 whatever the heck that might give it

650
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,915
当然给出一个正数和
certainly gives a positive number and

651
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,094
这将是lambda1加lambda2
that will be lambda 1 plus lambda 2

652
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,294
这是跟踪，但lambda2是0我们
that's the trace but lambda 2 is 0 we

653
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:50,665
从中知道它是单数，所以我们知道
know from this it's singular so we know

654
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,635
其中lambda2为0，因此lambda1必须为0
where lambda 2 is 0 so lambda 1 must be

655
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,015
3加上55在服务拉姆达的
3 plus 5 5 in a service lambda the

656
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,785
lambdas必须是8Messrs3加5和
lambdas must be 8 Messrs 3 plus 5 and

657
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:08,834
1/3，这是一个积极的
1/3 and so that's a positive

658
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,205
半定哦，如果你想到的话
semi-definite oh if you think of the

659
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,445
正定矩阵作为一些丛
positive definite matrices as some clump

660
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:20,114
在矩阵空间然后是积极的
in matrix space then the positive

661
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,315
半定的是边缘
semi-definite ones are sort of the edge

662
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,295
他们是那个丛生的边界
of that clump they're the boundary of

663
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,255
那些不完整的丛生
the clump the ones that are not quite

664
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,344
里面而不是外面有两种
inside but not outside either there

665
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:34,035
他们正躺在边缘
they're lying right on the edge of

666
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,305
正定矩阵让我公正
positive definite matrices let me just

667
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:44,665
采取有啥约约矩阵什么
take a so what about what about a matrix

668
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:51,385
所有的故事是什么？
of all ones what's the what's the story

669
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,145
在那一个肯定的所有
on that one positive definite all the

670
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,505
数字是正半或正半
numbers are positive or positive semi

671
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,594
明确或不确定你的想法是什么？
definite or indefinite what do you think

672
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,985
这里还有一个半定的
here one more all one's semi definite

673
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,955
听起来很不错
sounds like a good guess

674
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,545
你知道这个特征值是什么
you know what the eigenvalues of this

675
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:18,594
矩阵将是30＆0为什么你说
matrix would be 3 0 & 0 why did you say

676
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:24,225
因为我们只有等级
that because we only have the rank is

677
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,265
是的，介绍那个级别的关键
yeah introduce that key where the rank

678
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,255
是1所以只有一个非零的本征
is 1 so there's only one nonzero eigen

679
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,795
价值然后跟踪告诉我它
value and then the trace tells me it's

680
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,215
这个数字是3所以这是一个
that that number is 3 so this is a

681
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,825
正半正定矩阵
positive positive semi definite matrix

682
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:48,864
所以所有这些测试都改变了
so so all these all these tests change a

683
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:52,495
一点半正定特征值
little for semi definite the eigenvalue

684
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,245
能量大于或等于更大
is greater or equal the energies greater

685
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,235
或等于0a转置a但现在
or equal to 0 the a transpose a but now

686
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,545
我不需要哦，我没有讨论这个
I don't require oh I didn't discuss this

687
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,575
但是半确定会允许
but but semi definite would allow

688
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,365
顺便说一下依赖列
dependent columns by the way

689
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,795
你要做的这对我来说是正确的
you got to do this for me right that

690
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,125
矩阵作为转置乘以一个公正的
matrix as a transpose times a just to

691
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:22,855
看到它是半定的，因为如此
see that it's semi definite because so

692
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:29,305
把它写成转置是的，如果是的话
write that as a transpose a yeah if it's

693
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,765
排名第一的矩阵你知道怎么做
a rank one matrix you know how to what

694
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:38,245
它必须看起来像转移是如何
it must look like a transfer was a how

695
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,705
我将参与其中的许多术语
many terms am I going to have in in this

696
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,165
现在我回想起来了
and now I'm thinking back to the very

697
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,545
如果我离开，这个课程的开始
beginning of this course if I pulled off

698
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:52,635
一般来说这是lambdaone
the pieces in general this is lambda one

699
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,155
乘以第一个特征向量乘以
times the first eigenvector times the

700
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,835
第一个特征向量转置是的
first eigenvector transpose yeah would

701
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,015
只是三个人的向量是的
just be a vector of three ones yeah so

702
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:10,225
所以这就是通常的情况
so this would be the usual picture that

703
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,945
这与QlambdaQ相同
this is the same as the Q lambda Q

704
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,395
转置这是大的
transpose this is this is the big big

705
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,485
任何对称矩阵的事实和这个
fact for any symmetric matrix and this

706
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:27,505
是对称的，但它的等级只有一个
is symmetric but its rank is only one so

707
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,185
这使拉姆达二是对于零
that so that lambda two is zero for that

708
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,395
矩阵lambda3对于该矩阵为零
matrix lambda 3 is zero for that matrix

709
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,605
和一个特征向量是
and and the one eigen vector is the

710
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,455
矢量111和本征所以这样
vector 1 1 1 and the eigen so this would

711
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:49,375
是3次111哦我必须这样做
be 3 times 1 1 1 oh I have to do yeah so

712
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,995
我打算做3次111次1次
I was going to do 3 times 1 1 1 times 1

713
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,315
11但是这给了我333但不是
1 1 but that gives me 3 3 3 that's not

714
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,275
对，我必须将它们标准化
right I have to normalize them that's

715
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,995
对
right

716
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,305
是的，所以这是一个长度的矢量
yeah so that's a vector of whose length

717
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,345
是3的平方根，所以我必须划分
is square root of 3 so I have to divide

718
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:14,575
通过它除以它然后3
by that divide by it and then the 3

719
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,615
取消三和的平方根
cancels the square root of threes and

720
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:22,515
我刚刚离开了111111
I'm just left with the 1 1 1 1 1 1

721
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,925
所以我们的建筑有一个矩阵
so there is a matrix one of our building

722
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,415
块类型矩阵，因为它只有
block type matrices because it only has

723
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,885
一个非零的特征值，它的等级是1
one nonzero eigen value it's rank is 1

724
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,675
所以它不能是肯定的
so it could not be positive definite

725
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,875
它是单数但它是积极的
it's it's singular but it is positive

726
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,965
半定因为那个本征值
semi definite because that eigen value

727
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,435
是好的
is positive okay

728
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,114
所以你有了肯定的想法
so you got the idea of positive definite

729
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,505
矩阵再次是所有这五个中的任何一个
matrices again all five of those any one

730
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,845
这五项测试足以表明
of those five tests is enough to show

731
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:03,015
这是肯定的，所以
that it's positive definite and so

732
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,375
我下周的目标是单数
what's my goal next week is the singular

733
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,285
价值分解和那一切
value decomposition and all that that

734
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,864
引导我们到那就是我们所处的位置
leads us to that's that's where we're

735
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:18,585
现在准备在SVD好了
there now ready for at the SVD okay have

736
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,315
一个愉快的周末，看到你哦，我看到你了
a good weekend and see ya oh I see you

737
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,010
on Tuesday I guess right not Monday but

738
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:27,910
星期二，我猜对了，不是星期一

739
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,910
下周二
Tuesday next week
