好吧现在聚集图表所以这个
okay now clustering for graphs so this

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,655
这是一个重要的话题之一
is a topic this is one of the important

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,985
你可以尝试用图表做的事情
things you can try to do with a graph so

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:45,215
你有一个大图，让我有种
you have a large graph let me kind of

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:55,385
将它分成两个群可以，所以你
divide it into two clusters okay so you

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,235
得到一个巨大的图形，然后将工作就是
get a giant graph and then the job is to

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,395
从中得出一些意义
make some sense out of it and one

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,365
可能的步骤是能够细分
possible step is to be able to subdivide

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:11,254
如果我看到这里有一个切口
it if as I see here there's a cut

18
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,305
在两个相当相等的部分之间
between two reasonably equal parts of

19
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,735
图表合理地相同
the graph reasonably reasonably same

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,935
大小，因此该图表可以
size and therefore that graph could be

21
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,625
两部分研究所以问题是
studied in two pieces so the question is

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,365
你如何通过a找到这样的切割
how do you find such a cut by a by a

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,075
算法什么是一个算法，将
algorithm what's an algorithm that would

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,495
发现这样切，所以这是一个问题
find that cut so the so that's a problem

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,195
让我们说我们正在寻找两个四个
let's say we're looking for two four

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:46,835
四个两个集群我们可以寻找更多
four two clusters we could look for more

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,845
集群，但让我们说我们想看
clusters but let's say we want to look

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,275
对于两个集群，我们在尝试什么
for two clusters so what are we trying

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,805
我们要尽量减少这个
to do we're trying to minimize so this

30
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:06,175
是问题，所以我们寻找发现
is the problem then so we look for find

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,555
位置x和y让我们说两个
positions x and y let's say two which

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,725
将成为中心，可以这么说
will be the center's so to speak of the

33
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,305
而且真的只是这些点是啊
and really it's just these points yeah

34
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,484
这样就可以得到数据了
that so that the data is the points and

35
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,645
边缘一直是节点和
the edges as always the nodes and the

36
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,285
边虽然所以问题是找到x
edges though so the problem is to find x

37
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,895
和y以便最小化
and y so that to minimize

38
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:44,264
所以这是AI与X点的距离
so it's a distance of points AI from X

39
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,234
也许应该强调我们处于高位
maybe should emphasize we're in high

40
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,605
尺寸加上其他的距离
dimensions plus the distance of other

41
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,165
因此AI将成为这些点
points so the AI will be these points

42
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,035
这些节点和bi将是这些
these nodes and the bi will be these

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,604
节点加上BI减去y的平方和
nodes plus the sum of BI minus y squared

44
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:13,824
你这里了解规则
and you understand the rule here that

45
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:21,014
蜜蜂的A联盟
the together the the A's Union the bees

46
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,574
给我所有节点，我想是
give me all nodes and I guess to be

47
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:34,645
完成a的a与a的交叉
complete the a's the a's intersect the

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,895
蜜蜂是空的只是你期望的
bees is empty just just what you expect

49
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,044
我把A和B分成了
I'm dividing the A's and the B's into

50
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,634
两组，我正在选择x和ay
two groups and I'm picking an x and a y

51
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,695
因此，这些群体的中心
sort of at the center of those groups so

52
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,365
这是最低限度，所以我想
that that is a minimum so I want to

53
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,435
最小化，也许我想
minimize and also I probably want to

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,704
施加一些条件的数量
impose some condition that the number of

55
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,225
A的是相当接近的数
A's is reasonably close to the number of

56
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,574
蜜蜂换句话说，我不想只是
bees in other words I don't want just

57
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,335
那将是一个和所有其余的
that to be the a and all the rest to be

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,675
蜜蜂不会是一个
the bees that would be not a

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,805
令人满意的聚类我正在寻找
satisfactory clustering I'm looking for

60
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,515
群集是大小合适的群集
clusters that are good sized clusters so

61
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,384
最小化，所以有很多
minimize that okay so there are a lot of

62
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,444
有些不同的算法
different algorithms to do it some are

63
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,275
更直接地攻击这个问题
more directly attacking this problem

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,904
其他人使用我们关联的矩阵
others use matrices that we associate

65
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,455
用图，从而让我告诉你
with the graph so let me tell you about

66
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,404
两个或三个
two or three

67
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,355
那些算法和你，如果你已经
those algorithms and and you if you've

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,355
看过本研究有一个图表课程
seen studied had a course in graph

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,424
理论你可能已经看过了
theory this you may already have seen

70
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,704
这个问题首先是问题
this problem first question would be

71
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,254
假设我认为这些是A和
suppose I decide these are the A's and

72
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,084
那些是蜜蜂或其他一些
those are the bees or some other

73
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,334
决定可能是其他一些
decision yeah probably some other

74
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,704
决定我不想解决
decisions I don't want to solve the

75
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,474
我开始之前的问题
problem before I even start

76
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,164
所以一些A和一些B会是什么
so some A's and some B's what would be

77
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,174
你曾经是X的最佳选择
the best choice of the X once you've

78
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:19,694
决定A和什么是
decided on the A's and what would be the

79
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,244
在Y的最佳选择，一旦你决定
best choice of the Y once you've decided

80
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:26,654
在B上，以便我们可以回答这个问题
on the B's so so that we can answer that

81
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,574
问我们是否知道这两个问题
question just if we knew the the two

82
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:36,374
小组我们可以看到他们应该在哪里
groups we could see where they should be

83
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,804
以第一组为中心
centered with the first group centered

84
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,954
在X，第二组以Y和为中心
at X the second group centered at Y and

85
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,764
什么是我的中心让我们说
what is centering me so let's just say

86
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:57,884
所以我想我在这里说的是这样的
so I think what I'm saying here is so

87
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,274
考虑到一个是A的，这是一个一上来
given the a's the a's this is a one up

88
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:11,855
说AK什么是最好的就是最好的
to say a k what is the best is the best

89
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:19,184
x只是为了使那部分正确而且
x to just to make that part right and

90
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,004
答案是你知道吗？
the answer is do do you know

91
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,704
几何上X应该在这里X是
geometrically what X should be here X is

92
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,514
所以，如果我有一堆积分和
the so if I have a bunch of points and

93
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,795
我正在寻找中间的那些
I'm looking for the middle of those

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,564
将X点指向一个好的X点
points the point X a good point X to say

95
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,545
好吧，这是它的中间部分
okay that's the middle it'll make the

96
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,204
我认为平方距离的总和
sum of the distances I think squared I

97
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,154
希望我是对的
hope I'm right about that

98
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:50,584
至少X是什么是什么
a minimum what's the what is X it is the

99
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:54,554
质心质心是X字
the centroid centroid is the word X is

100
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:58,875
质心
the centroids

101
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,495
的的A的，什么是
of the of the A's and what is the

102
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,275
质心让我们看得好，也许我没有
centroid let's see well maybe I don't

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,365
知道x和y我们是不是一个好选择
know if x and y we're a good choice but

104
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:16,185
让我看看我猜它是什么
look let me see what I guess it's the

105
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,375
平均值a它是A的总和
average a it's the sum of the A's of

106
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,945
这些A是那些是矢量的
these A's those are those are vectors of

107
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:32,045
当然，由A的I数除以
course divided by the number of A's I

108
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,805
我想我其实很快
think actually I was just quickly

109
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,735
今天早上回顾所以我不是
reviewing this morning so I'm not

110
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,645
完全在这个质心的顶部，我是什么
totally on top of this centroid what I'm

111
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,925
打算谈谈我的算法
going to talk the algorithm that I'm

112
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,195
要谈的是K井K.
going to talk about is the K well K

113
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,505
意味着它总是在这里被召唤
means it's always called and here it

114
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:59,385
将是K将是我刚才拥有的两个
will be the K will be two I just have

115
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,795
两个分为两组a和B.
two partitioning into two sets a and B

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,975
所以我只是K是仅有2好是什么
so I just K is just 2 okay what's the

117
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:14,225
算法好，如果我选择了一个
algorithm well if if I've chosen a

118
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,575
分区A的和B的有
partition the A's and the B's have

119
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,695
将它们分开然后告诉我什么
separated them then that tells me what

120
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,065
X和y应该是，但现在是什么
the X and the y should be but now what

121
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,045
我会做下一个，所以这将是一个
do I do next so is this going to be a

122
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,885
我现在是一个交替的分区
sort of an alternating partition now I

123
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,375
采取这两个质心，所以第一步
take those two centroids so so step one

124
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:43,214
是原谅YZ和B找到他们的
is forgiven YZ and B's find their

125
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:51,545
质心X和什么和那个基本的
centroids X and what and that elementary

126
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:57,675
然后第二步给出了
then the second step is given the

127
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,695
给出那些位置的质心x和y
centroids x and y given those positions

128
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,965
给定x和y它们不会是质心
given x and y they won't be centroids

129
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,395
一旦你看到x发生了什么
once when you see what happens given x

130
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,975
和y
and y

131
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:22,575
我们形成最好的分区
we do we form form the best partition

132
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:32,475
最好的集群好吧，所以我们有一步
best clusters okay so step one we we had

133
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,785
猜测最好的集群是什么
a guess at what the best clusters were

134
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,985
我们现在找到了他们的质心
and we found their centroids now we

135
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,805
从质心开始，我们形成新的
start with the centroids and we form new

136
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,535
再次集群，如果这些集群是
clusters again and if these clusters are

137
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,085
和我们开始时一样
the same as the ones we started with

138
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,465
与他们然后算法有
with them then the algorithm has

139
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,185
融合但可能不会是这些
converged but probably won't be these

140
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,825
集群所以你必须告诉我什么
clusters so you'll have to tell me what

141
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,555
如果我是最好的集群，我的意思是什么
what I mean by the best clusters if I'm

142
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,435
如果我有两点x和y我
if I've got the two points x and y I

143
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,405
想要我要分开的所有点
want the points I want to separate all

144
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,565
围绕X聚集到该点
the points that cluster around X to the

145
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,945
那些聚集在Y周围的人然后他们
ones that cluster around Y and then they

146
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,925
可能与我原来的不同
probably different from my original

147
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,675
从现在开始我现在有了新的东西，我再说一遍
start so now I've got new now I repeat

148
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,725
第一步，但让我们想想怎么做
step one so but let's just think how do

149
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,375
我形成最佳群以及我坐
i form the best clusters well I take a

150
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,735
点，我必须决定它是否去
point and I have to decide does it go

151
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,225
与X或它在X去
with X or does it go with in the X

152
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,085
群集或它是否进入群集
cluster or does it go in the cluster

153
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,095
在Y附近，我该怎么做才决定
around Y so how do I decide that just

154
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,255
无论哪一个都接近每一个
whichever one is closer to so each each

155
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:49,575
要与每个节点一起使用II
point goes with each node you should I I

156
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:56,075
可以说每个节点都跟着
could say each node goes with the the

157
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:04,495
更接近x和y
closer of x and y

158
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,455
应该是那样的点
so points that should have been that are

159
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,225
现在我们要接近X了
closer to X now we're going to put them

160
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,795
在X周围的集群中，并做到这一点
in the cluster around X and does that

161
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,165
解决问题
solve the problem

162
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,685
不，因为它可能，但它可能
no because well it might but it might

163
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:27,055
不是我们要回来一个步骤
not the we have to come back to step one

164
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,915
我们现在已经改变了他们的集群
we've now changed their clusters they'll

165
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,274
有不同的质心，所以我们重复
have different centroids so we repeat

166
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,735
第一步找到他们的质心
step one find their centroids for the

167
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,165
然后我们来两个新的集群
two new clusters then we come to step

168
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,015
两个找到应该配合的
two find the ones that should go with

169
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,765
两个质心来回我
the two centroids and back and forth I

170
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,524
不知道我不认为有一个很好的
don't know I don't think there's a nice

171
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,195
收敛理论或收益率
theory of convergence or rate of

172
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,955
收敛所有这个问题
convergence all the questions that this

173
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,265
当然总是问，但这是非常的
course is always asking but it's a very

174
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,735
流行算法K-机构K将
popular algorithm k-means K would be to

175
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,495
有K群可以，所以我不是
have K clusters okay so that's a I'm not

176
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,715
去讨论我宁愿讨论
going to discuss the I'd rather discuss

177
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,535
其他一些方法来解决这个问题
some other ways to do this to solve this

178
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,945
问题，但这是一种黑客
problem but that's one sort of hack that

179
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,195
工作得很好，所以第二种方法
works quite well okay so second approach

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,005
是下一秒才会到来的
is is what it's coming next second

181
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:40,165
解决方法，它被称为
solution method and it's called the

182
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:48,894
谱聚类
spectral clustering

183
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,704
这是方法的名称和之前的名称
that's the name of the method and before

184
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,764
我记下你做什么做什么的
I write down what you do what does the

185
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:59,644
字光谱意味着你看到光谱
word spectral mean you see spectral

186
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,125
图论谱谱聚类与in
graph theory spectral clustering and in

187
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,884
你看到的其他数学部分
other parts of mathematics you see that

188
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,185
你在哪里看到我给出的谱定理
where you see spectral theorem I gave

189
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,704
你最多，我把它描述为
you the most and I described it as the

190
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,235
最重要的也许是线性定理
most important perhaps theorem in linear

191
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,084
代数中至少有一个是前三名
algebra at least one of the top three is

192
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,555
所以我会把它写在这里，因为它是
so I'll write it over here because it's

193
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,084
不是这不是它是一样的
not it doesn't this is a it's the same

194
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:35,644
字谱很好让我问一下
word spectral well let me ask the

195
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,954
再问一下这个词是什么
question again what's that word spectral

196
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,894
什么意思是手段
about what does that mean that means

197
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,134
如果我有一个矩阵，我想
that if I have a matrix and I want to

198
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,704
说说它的频谱是什么
talk about its spectrum what is the

199
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:52,355
矩阵的光谱就是它
spectrum of the matrix it is the the

200
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,255
特征值因此谱理论谱
eigenvalues so spectral theory spectral

201
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,735
聚类使用的是特征值
clustering is using the eigenvalues of

202
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,905
一些矩阵就是那个光谱
some matrix that's what that spectral is

203
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,394
告诉我是的光谱定理
telling me yeah so the spectral theorem

204
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,855
当然是对称矩阵
of course is that for a symmetric matrix

205
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:17,485
特征值是真实的和
s the eigenvalues are real and the

206
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,675
特征向量是正交的而不是
eigenvectors are orthogonal and don't

207
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,105
忘记真实的完整陈述是什么
forget what the real full statement is

208
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,915
在这里，因为可能会重复
here because there could be repeated

209
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,465
真正的特征值和什么是
real eigenvalues and what does the

210
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,954
谱定理告诉我对称性
spectral theorem tell me for symmetric

211
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,355
如果lambda等于5则为矩阵
matrices if that if lambda equal five is

212
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,985
如果它是四次，则重复四次
repeated four times if it's a four times

213
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,405
给出的等式的解
solution of the equation that gives

214
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,375
特征值那么结论是什么
eigenvalues then what's the conclusion

215
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,725
然后有四个独立的
then there are four independent

216
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,084
我正交
orthogonal I

217
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,954
矢量与它一起去我们不能这么说
vectors to go with it we can't say that

218
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,944
关于矩阵
about matrices

219
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,915
关于所有矩阵，但我们可以说
about all matrices but we can say it

220
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,965
关于所有对称矩阵，事实上
about all symmetric matrices and in fact

221
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,454
这些本征矢量是正交的，以便
those eigenvectors are orthogonal so

222
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:18,215
我们甚至会说更多我们能找到的东西
we're even saying more we can find for

223
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,004
与a一起使用的正交特征向量
orthogonal eigenvectors that go with a

224
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:25,684
与特征值的多重好吗
with a multiplicity for eigenvalues okay

225
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:28,235
这是光谱定理谱
that's spectral theorem spectral

226
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:37,615
聚类开始于
clustering starts with the with the

227
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:47,254
图拉普拉斯矩阵我记得
graph laplacian matrix may I remember

228
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,514
那个矩阵是什么因为那是
what that matrix is because that's the

229
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,804
这是线性的关键连接
that's the key connection of linear

230
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,564
代数到图论是
algebra to graph theory is the

231
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,545
此图拉普利安的属性
properties of this graph laplacian

232
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,655
矩阵好吧让我说L为
matrix okay so let me say L for

233
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,694
laplacian使矩阵单向
laplacian so that matrix one way to

234
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:14,554
将它描述为转置a
describe it is as a transpose a where a

235
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:24,924
是曲线图的关联矩阵或
is the incidence matrix of the graph or

236
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:29,704
我们将看到的另一种方式是D
another way we'll see is two is the D

237
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:41,915
对角线的度矩阵
the degree matrix that's diagonal

238
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,655
我会举一个例子来提醒一下
and I'll do an example just to remind

239
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,494
你-我不知道我叫什么
you - the I don't know what I've called

240
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:54,314
这个我应该叫它为B.
this one shall I call it B for the

241
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,285
那个时刻和B是什么矩阵
moment and what matrix is B that's the

242
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:08,924
邻接矩阵真的你应该知道
adjacency matrix really you should know

243
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:15,044
这四个矩阵他们是关键的四个
these four matrices they're the key four

244
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,255
与任何图形相关联的矩阵
matrices associated with any graph the

245
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:25,274
入射矩阵是M个n行边缘
incidence matrix that's M by n row edges

246
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:31,515
和节点边缘和节点，所以它
and nodes edges and nodes so it's

247
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,355
矩形，但我正在形成一个转置
rectangular but I'm forming a transpose

248
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,205
我在这里，所以我形成一个对称的
ru here so I'm forming a symmetric

249
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,875
正半定矩阵
positive semi definite matrix

250
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,885
所以这个小花朵是对称的
so this this little blossom is symmetric

251
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,404
积极的半明确是的，让我让
positive semi definite yeah let me let

252
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:53,475
我只记得所有这些矩阵
me just recall what all these matrices

253
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:01,445
是为了一个简单的图表
are for for a simple graph

254
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:08,764
好的，所以我只是画一个图表好吧
okay so I'll just draw a graph alright

255
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:15,494
好吧所以发生率矩阵有1个
okay so the incidence matrix there are 1

256
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:23,235
2345个边缘所以5行有4个
2 3 4 5 edges so 5 rows there are 4

257
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,105
节点123和4所以4列和a
nodes 1 2 3 and 4 so 4 columns and a

258
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,185
典型的行将是边缘1
typical row would be edge 1 going from

259
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,065
节点1到节点2所以它会有一个
node 1 to node 2 so it would have a

260
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,044
减1和1在那里，让我采取
minus 1 and a 1 there and let me take

261
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:46,754
它的两个从1到3节点，所以我们
its two going from 1 to node 3 so we'd

262
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,705
那里有一个减1和1
have a minus 1 and a 1 there so so

263
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,554
这就是发生率矩阵，确定是什么
that's the incidence matrix a ok what's

264
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,804
程度矩阵很简单
the degree matrix that's simple

265
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:06,244
度数矩阵a转置a
the degree matrix well a transpose a

266
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:11,764
这是Mbyn这是n由M所以它是
this is M by n this is n by M so it's

267
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:22,424
在这种情况下，它通过n确定4乘4
it's n by n ok in this case 4 by 4 so

268
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,215
度矩阵将是4乘4和
the degree matrix will be 4 by 4 and by

269
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,614
他和它会告诉我们的程度
him and it will tell us the degree of

270
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,374
这意味着我们只计算它
that which means which we just count the

271
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,034
边缘所以它的3个边缘没有23
edges so it's 3 edges going in no 2 3

272
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:39,315
进入节点3的边只有2条边
edges going in node 3 has just 2 edges

273
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,364
并且节点4只有2条边缘
and node 4 has just 2 edges it so that's

274
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:46,784
程度矩阵然后是邻接
the degree matrix and then the adjacency

275
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,945
我称之为B的矩阵也是4乘4
matrix that I've called B is also 4 by 4

276
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,404
它是什么告诉我们哪个节点是
and what is it it tells us which node is

277
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:00,705
连接到哪个节点所以我不这样做
connected to which node so and I don't

278
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:06,105
允许节点边缘
allow nodes edges

279
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,284
将O连接到自身以使其为零
that connect an O to itself so zeros on

280
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:10,005
对角线
the diagonal

281
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,725
连接到哪个节点的数量
how many so which nodes are connected to

282
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,725
节点一井两个和四个
node one well all of two and four and

283
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,154
三个连接到一个所以我有
three are connected to one so I have

284
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:25,185
那三个节点都没有
ones there no to all three nodes are

285
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,635
连接-不-所以我会有第二个
connected - no - so I'll have the second

286
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,274
列和行将包含所有三个
column and row will have all three ones

287
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,195
怎么没有三个没关系只边缘
how about no three okay only only edges

288
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,034
只有两条边连接到
only two edges are connected only to

289
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,355
只有两个节点连接到三个节点
only two nodes are connected to three

290
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,534
一，二，但不是四，一，二
one and two but not four so one and two

291
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:52,544
我有，但不是四个好，所以这是
I have but not four okay so that's the

292
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:57,455
邻接矩阵就是这么认为的
adjacency matrix is that right think so

293
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,865
这是度矩阵是这样的
this is the degree matrix this is the

294
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,764
关联矩阵和该公式给出
incidence matrix and that formula gives

295
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,034
我laplacian好吧，让我们写一下
me the laplacian okay let's just write

296
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:16,514
如果我使用了laplacian那么
down the laplacian so if I use the

297
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,355
度减去B中，很容易的
degree minus B that that's easy the

298
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,404
度数是332和2现在我有这些
degrees were 3 3 2 & 2 now I have these

299
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:36,385
弊端和那些0好的
minuses and those those were 0 ok

300
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,335
这是一个积极的半明确
so that's a positive semi-definite

301
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,165
矩阵是一个正定矩阵
matrix is it a positive definite matrix

302
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,705
所以我们会让我问你是不是很奇怪
so we'll let me ask you is it singular

303
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,935
或者它不是单数
or is it not singular

304
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,755
是否在其零空间或中有一个向量
is there a vector in its null space or

305
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,055
它的零空间中没有向量
is there not a vector in its null space

306
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:02,855
你可以解决dx等于全零和
can you solve d x equals all zeroes and

307
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,815
当然，你们每个人都可以看到这一点
of course you can everybody sees that

308
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,875
所有人的矢量将是一个
the vector of all ones will be a

309
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,065
解决D到2l我很抱歉我应该
solution to D to 2l I'm sorry I should

310
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:25,535
在这里说LLx等于0Lx等于
be saying L here L x equals 0 L x equals

311
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:35,255
0表示一维的整行
0 for a whole line of a one-dimensional

312
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:42,805
并且L的零空间具有维度
and the null space of L is has dimension

313
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:48,535
1它有一个基础向量1111和
1 it's got one basis vector 1 1 1 1 and

314
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,795
这将永远发生在a
that will always happen with a with a

315
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,435
使用我创建的图表设置
with the graph set up that I've created

316
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,335
好的，这是第一个事实
ok so that's the first fact that this

317
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,355
正半正定矩阵Las
positive semi definite matrix L as

318
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,895
lambda1等于0，特征向量为
lambda 1 equals 0 and the eigenvector is

319
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,665
常数cccc是一维特征
constant cccc the one-dimensional eigen

320
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,025
空间或1111是典型的
space or 1 1 1 1 is a typical

321
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:29,855
特征向量现在回到图表
eigenvector ok now back to graph

322
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,015
将图的概念聚类为图
clustering the idea of graph a graph

323
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,005
集群是看费德勒
clustering is to look at the Fiedler

324
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:45,115
本征矢量这就是所谓的X2是
eigen vector this is called X 2 is the

325
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,435
下一个特征向量是
next eigenvector is the

326
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,335
最小的特征向量
the eigenvector for the smallest

327
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,975
λmin的正特征值
positive eigenvalue for lambda min

328
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,705
排除0所以最小的特征值
excluding 0 so the smallest eigenvalue

329
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:14,175
l最小特征值及其特征值
of l the smallest eigenvalue and its

330
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,785
特征向量这被称为Fiedler
eigenvector this is called the Fiedler

331
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,835
以捷克命名的矢量
vector named after the Czech

332
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,595
数学家伟大伟大的人
mathematician a great great a great man

333
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,805
在线性代数中，他研究了这一点
in linear algebra and he studied this

334
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,255
矢量这种情况所以每个人
vector this situation so everybody who

335
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,775
知道laplacian知道的图形
knows about the graph laplacian is aware

336
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,465
它的第一个特征值为零，
that its first eigenvalue is zero and

337
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,035
下一个特征值是重要的
that the next eigenvalue is is important

338
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,975
是啊
yeah

339
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:59,274
拉普拉斯方程式是的，所以是的
to Laplace's equation yes so yeah that's

340
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,784
一个好问题，为什么这个名字的名字
a good question so why the word the name

341
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:12,235
拉普拉斯马马虎虎
laplacian so-so

342
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,874
是啊，这是一个很好的问题，因此
yeah that's a good question so the

343
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:20,304
熟悉的东西，所以它连接到
familiar thing so it connects to

344
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,185
拉普拉斯的有限差分方程
Laplace's finite difference equation

345
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,624
因为我们在谈论矩阵
because we're talking about matrices

346
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:28,154
这里而不是衍生品而不是功能
here and not derivatives not functions

347
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,855
那么为什么laplacian这个词如果我如此
so why the word laplacian well so if I

348
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,004
如果我的图表是合成的，那就有规律
have a regular if my graph is composed

349
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:41,664
这样就有一个包含25个节点的图形
of so there's a graph with with 25 nodes

350
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:48,325
这是4倍520约40
and 4 times 5 20 about 40 this is

351
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:57,014
可能有大约40个边和25个节点
probably has about 40 edges and 25 nodes

352
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:02,095
当然我可以构建它的图形
and of course I can construct its graph

353
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,754
所有这四个矩阵都是它的
all those four matrices for it it's it's

354
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,185
关联矩阵的度矩阵
incidence matrix its degree matrix of

355
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,815
学位将适用于所有这些
the degree will be for at all these

356
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,004
内部点数度为3点
inside points the degree will be 3 at

357
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,825
这些边界点的程度将是
these boundary points the degree will be

358
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,455
2在这些角落但是什么
2 at these corner points but the what

359
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,235
将矩阵L看起来像那么还等什么
will the matrix L look like so so what

360
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,404
是L，这将告诉你它为什么
is L and that will tell you why it has

361
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:41,965
这个名字laplacian所以矩阵L会
this name laplacian so the matrix L will

362
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,874
有4个权利的学位将在
have the degree 4 right will be on the

363
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:49,185
对角线来自D另一个
diagonal that's coming from D the other

364
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,924
减去的是来自的
the minus ones that come from be the

365
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,845
邻接矩阵将与。相关联
adjacency matrix will be associated with

366
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,644
这些节点否则全部为零，从而
those nodes and otherwise all zeros so

367
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:04,835
这是L的典型行
this is a typical row of L

368
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,624
Elle的典型角色以此为中心
typical role of Elle centered at that

369
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:11,465
节点也许那个节点号为510
node so maybe that's node number five 10

370
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,085
这将是25个中的13个
13 that's 13 out of 25 that would would

371
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,455
告诉你这个，对不起那些
show you this and that sorry those are

372
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,975
减去那些减去那么一个4a4
minus ones minus ones so a 4 a 4 in the

373
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,485
在对角线和4减去那些
on the diagonal and 4 minus ones that's

374
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,754
图表的模型问题
the model problem for when the graph is

375
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,744
一个网格方格，你是否关联
a grid square grid and do you associate

376
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:37,054
拉普拉斯方程所以这是
that with Laplace's equation so this is

377
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:41,284
这就是拉普拉斯的原因
the this is the reason that the Laplace

378
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:45,605
为什么加号会因为而加入呢？
why why the plus gets in it because

379
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,065
拉普拉斯方程的微分
Laplace's equation the differential

380
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,705
方程式是二阶导数
equation is second derivative with

381
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,134
尊重x平方和第二个
respect to x squared and the second

382
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,924
导数特殊y平方为0
derivative the special y squared is 0

383
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:01,894
我们这里有什么为Lu等于0
and what we have here is L u equals 0

384
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:06,244
它是矢量的离散拉普拉斯
it's discrete laplacian the vector

385
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:09,634
laplacian图拉普拉斯所在的地方
laplacian the graph laplacian where the

386
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:12,965
第二个X衍生物被减去
second X derivative is replaced by minus

387
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,355
1至-1和第二Y衍生物
1 to minus 1 and the second Y derivative

388
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,644
由-1减1秒代替
is replaced by minus 1 to minus 1 second

389
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:22,955
X和y的差异
differences in the X and the y

390
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,695
方向，所以是的，所以这是
directions so that's yeah so that's the

391
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,695
这就是laplace的解释
that's the explanation for laplace it's

392
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,774
离散的laplace离散或
a discrete laplace discrete or the

393
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:40,835
有限差分拉普拉斯现在好了
finite difference Laplace okay now to

394
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,044
我必须告诉你什么是什么
finish I have to tell you what the what

395
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:50,044
群集如何决定群集
clusters how do you decide the clusters

396
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:54,965
从L如何提出两个集群
from L how does L propose two clusters

397
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:00,935
A和B的，而且这里是
the A's and the B's and and here's the

398
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,424
回答他们来自这个特征向量
answer they come from this eigenvector

399
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:09,634
你看到的fiedler特征向量
the fiedler eigenvectors you look at

400
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:12,245
那个特征向量
that eigenvector

401
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,115
它有一些积极的和一些消极的
it's got some positive and some negative

402
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,235
组件具有正面的组件
components the components with positive

403
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,325
这个特征向量的数量所以
numbers of this eigenvector so the

404
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:37,245
积极的X的积极成分
positive the positive components of X so

405
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,945
这个特征向量的这种耶和
of this yeah of this eigenvector and

406
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,585
这有负面的组成部分
there are negative components of this

407
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,635
特征向量和那两个
eigenvector and those are the two

408
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,735
群集，所以这就是群集
clusters so there so it's the cluster is

409
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,034
这两个集群是由
the two clusters are decided by the

410
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,495
特征向量由符号加或减
eigenvector by the signs plus or minus

411
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,274
组件的标志加号
signs of the components the plus signs

412
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,435
去1，减号进入
going 1 and the minus signs go into

413
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,105
另一个，你必须尝试
another and you have to experiment to

414
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,975
看到那会成功我不知道
see that that would succeed I don't know

415
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,095
它实际上会做些什么
what it would do on this actually

416
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,794
因为几乎没有分裂成两个
because that's hardly splits up into two

417
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,304
我想也许是分裂
I suppose maybe the split is along a

418
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:25,005
这样或那样的线来得到我
line like that or something to to get I

419
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,774
不知道那是什么聚类
don't know what clustering that's that

420
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:29,685
这不是一个自然的图表
this is not a graph that is naturally

421
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,695
群集但你仍然可以做两个
clustered but you could still do two

422
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,585
它的k-means你仍然可以做
k-means on it you could still do

423
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,385
光谱聚类，你会发现
spectral clustering and you would find

424
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,245
这个特征向量现在有什么意义
this eigenvector now what's the point

425
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,394
关于这个特征向量，我将完成
about this eigenvector there I'll finish

426
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,515
在一瞬间我们对此了解多少
in one moment what do we know about that

427
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,534
特征向量与那个相比
eigenvector as compared to that one so

428
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:55,965
这是一个特征向量，所有人都让我
here was an eigenvector all ones let me

429
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,835
只是使它在所有的一个一个一个一个一个
just make it all one one one one one in

430
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,024
该照片在这里是25周的人是一对
that picture it's 25 ones here's a the

431
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,385
下一个特征向量和什么是
next eigenvector up and what's the

432
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,455
这两个特征向量之间的关系
relation between those two eigenvectors

433
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,615
升它们是正交
of L they are orthogonal

434
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,804
这些是对称的特征向量
these are eigenvectors of a symmetric

435
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,435
矩阵因此它们是正交的
matrix so they're orthogonal so that

436
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,725
意味着与这个家伙正交
means to be orthogonal to this guy

437
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,284
意味着您的组件添加到零
means that your components added to zero

438
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:30,585
右边的矢量与所有的矢量正交
right a vector is orthogonal to all ones

439
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,615
这个点积只是加起来的
that dot product is just add up the

440
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,595
组件所以我们有一堆
components so we have a bunch of

441
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,244
积极的组成部分和一堆
positive components and a bunch of

442
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:39,284
负面成分他们有相同
negative components they have the same

443
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:43,095
总和，因为因为点积与
sum because because the dot product with

444
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,065
那是零和那两个组成部分
that is zero and those two components

445
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,774
这两组组件是你的
those two sets of components are your to

446
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,205
告诉你光谱中的两个星团
tell you the two clusters in spectral

447
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,945
集群所以它非常漂亮
clustering so it's a pretty nifty

448
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,605
它确实要求你计算一个算法
algorithm it does ask you to compute an

449
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,414
特征向量，当然需要
eigen vector and that of course takes

450
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:07,874
时间，然后有三分之一以上
time and then there's a third more

451
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:12,465
直接算法来做到这一点
direct algorithm to to do this

452
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,894
实际上有优化问题
optimization problem well actually there

453
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,504
这是一个很重要的问题
are many this is an important problem so

454
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:19,695
有很多提出的算法很好
there are many proposed algorithms good

455
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,575
好吧，我正在关闭那里有一场决赛
okay I'm closing up there was a final

456
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,605
对于k-means肯定是肯定的
question yeah well certainly for k-means

457
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,554
现在，如果我不得不做三个集群
now if i had to do three clusters with

458
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,274
fiedler我会看前三个
fiedler i would look at the first three

459
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,284
特征向量和第一个
eigenvectors and well the first one

460
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:38,355
就什么都不是，我会看看
would be nothing and i would look at the

461
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,235
接下来的两个，这将很漂亮
next two and that would be pretty

462
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,504
如果我想要六个集群，那就成功了
successful if I wanted six clusters it

463
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,144
可能会在脱落
probably would fall off in in the

464
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:50,355
在聚类的质量是的，但
quality of the the clustering yeah but

465
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,185
当然我会看看
that certainly I would look at the

466
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,174
最低六个特征向量并得到
lowest six eigenvectors and get

467
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:00,735
在某个地方是的，所以没关系，所以这是一个
somewhere yeah right so okay so that's a

468
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,394
话题重要话题我有点标准
topic important topic I sort of standard

469
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,534
应用图论中的主题没关系
topic in applied graph theory okay so

470
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:14,674
说你星期三我希望我希望
say your Wednesday I'm hoping I'm hoping

471
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,274
星期三所以阿德尔曼教授有
on Wednesday so professor Adelman has

472
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,325
告诉我一个新的，最佳的方式来看待
told me a new and optimal way to look at

473
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,764
反向传播你的问题
the problem of back propagation you

474
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:32,924
如果你记得回传
remember back propagation if you

475
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,904
记住你没有的讲座
remember the lecture on it you don't

476
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,154
难道你不想记住
don't you don't want to remember the

477
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:38,505
讲授它，它
lecture on it it

478
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,555
这是一个棘手的杂乱的事情
it's it's a tricky messy thing to

479
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,175
解释，但他说，如果我解释它
explain but he says if I explain it

480
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,655
在线性代数中使用Julia就是这样
using Julia in linear algebra it's it's

481
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,745
如此清晰，我们会给他一个机会
clear so we'll give him a chance on

482
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,035
周三表明那一点
Wednesday to show that that

483
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,155
革命性的方法
revolutionary approach to to the

484
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,215
反向传播的解释和I.
explanation of back propagation and I

485
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,965
希望我告诉他他可以有一半
hope for I told him he could have half

486
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,085
一个小时，项目需要一些
an hour and projects would take some

487
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,045
我希望现在我们不得不狂野
time I hope now we've had to with wild

488
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:19,355
掌声所以我希望我们能得到更多
applause so I hope we get a couple more

489
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,055
在我们上一节课上好的，请看星期三
in our last class okay see you Wednesday

490
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,175
如果你有好的话，如果你带好
and if you bring well if you have

491
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,925
项目准备好在线发送给我
projects ready send them to me online

492
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:33,795
也许打印输出也是如此
and maybe a printout as well that would

493
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,585
如果你没有准备就好，那就太棒了
be terrific if you don't have them ready

494
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:41,655
他们可以按小时去信封
by the hour they can go the envelope

495
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,605
在我办公室外面会收到它们
outside my office would receive them

496
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,970
good so I'll see you Wednesday for the

497
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,790
好的，所以周三我会见到你的

498
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,790
最后一堂课
final class
