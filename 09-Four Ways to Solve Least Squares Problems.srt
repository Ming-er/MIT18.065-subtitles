好吧首先要做的事情
well ok so first important things about

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,225
课程计划然后
the course plans for the course and then

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,545
我今天要搬到新的地方了
I'm today I'm going to move to the new

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,825
下一节的注释部分2或
next section of the notes section 2 or

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,705
第2部分我应该说，实际上我会
part 2 I should say and actually I'll

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,425
暂时跳过第2节1并继续
skip for the moment section 2 1 and go

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:56,385
第2节2和所有SEC的全部
to section 2 2 and all the SEC's all of

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,505
第2章可能会来找你
chapter 2 will come to you probably

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,544
今天或最近明天这样就到了哪里
today or latest tomorrow so that's where

18
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,215
接下来我们要继续关注
we're going next we're following the

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,675
除了我要去之外，我都非常小心地注意到
notes pretty carefully except I'm going

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,985
跳过有关张量的部分，直到我
to skip the section on tensors until I

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,995
学到更多
learn more

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,445
基本上是啊是的我可以说一点点
basically yeah yeah I could say a little

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,695
关于张量，但这会流动这种流动
about tensors but this flows this flows

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,474
自然地使用SVD所以它只是
naturally using the SVD so it's just

25
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,205
非常重要的问题最小二乘
terribly important problem least squares

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,385
当然，我知道你见过
and of course I know that you've seen

27
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,544
一种或两种方法做最小的方格和
one or two ways to do least squares and

28
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,125
这真的是整个主题来了
it's really the whole subject comes

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,614
我在这里想说些什么
together here I want to say something

30
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,985
在我发出寻找计划之前
before I send out a plan for looking

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,845
整个课程都是如此
ahead for the course as a whole so

32
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,065
没有期末考试，我也没有
there's no final exam and I don't really

33
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,724
看看如何检验你如何进行测试
see how to examine you how to give tests

34
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,684
我当然可以创建我们的测试用途
I could of course create our tests use

35
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,415
关于线性代数部分，但是
it on about the linear algebra part but

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,945
我不认为这不是那种
I don't think it's it's not sort of the

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,814
本课程的风格
style of this course to

38
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,995
期待您快速创建证明
to expect you quickly to create a proof

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,904
或者在我们班上的东西，但我想
or something in in our class but I think

40
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,604
所以我想，特别是看
so I think and especially looking at

41
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:27,594
我们走向了什么，走得很远
what we're headed for and moving quite

42
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,415
所有这些都是朝这个方向稳步前进的
steadily in that direction is all these

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,934
这些线性的所有问题
all the problems that these this linear

44
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,354
代数是针对一个
algebra is is aimed at right up to an

45
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,865
包括共轭梯度下降和
including conjugate gradient descent and

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,064
并深入学习大
and deep learning the the big the

47
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:53,995
非常重要和活泼
overwhelmingly important and lively

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,884
活跃的研究领域，我不能
active research area that's I couldn't

49
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,344
做得比保持上课更好
do better than to get keep the course

50
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:04,255
走向那个方向所以我想是什么
going in that direction so I think what

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,255
我想请你做的是后期和下旬
I would ask you to do is late late and

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,314
排序四月/五月的常规家庭作业
sort of april/may the regular homeworks

53
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,374
我会在某个时刻停止并且
I'll discontinue at a certain point and

54
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:23,755
相反，我会问
then instead I'll be asking and

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,715
鼓励一个我不知道的项目
encouraging a project I don't know if

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,775
这是正确的字被使用
that's the right word to be using in

57
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,145
你使用我们所做的和
which you use what we've done for and

58
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,755
我会发出一个关于恒星的消息
I'll send out a message on stellar

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,685
列表只有五六个区域
listing like five or six areas and only

60
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,384
我的意思是其中一个是机器
I mean one of them is the machine

61
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,245
学习深度学习的部分，但他们是
learning deep learning part but they're

62
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,495
这一切的所有其他部分
all the other parts that that that

63
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,255
事情我们已经学会了正在学习如何
things we've learned to are learning how

64
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,224
如何找到稀疏的解决方案
to do how to find sparse solutions for

65
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:58,224
关于。的例子或者什么
example or or something about the

66
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,805
伪逆各种事情，所以
pseudo-inverse all kinds of things so

67
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,175
我的目标是给你
that's my goal is to would give you

68
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,164
使用这种材料的事情
something to do which uses the material

69
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,254
你已经学会了，我不是
you've learned and look I I'm not

70
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,324
期待论文，但这是一个
expecting a thesis but it's a it's a

71
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,245
好机会所以它不仅仅是
good chance so it will be more than just

72
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,714
喜欢拖一些代码进行深度学习
like drag in some code for deep learning

73
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:28,765
和一些数据矩阵并做到这一点
and and some data matrix and do it

74
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,495
但我们会粉笔amaura这是一个时间
but we'll chalk amaura that's a time

75
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,455
来
comes

76
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,705
就像我以前想的那样
so like I just thought I'd say before

77
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,655
发出我要说的公告
sending out the announcement I would say

78
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:44,965
它正在成为一个更大的东西
it's coming about what as a as a larger

79
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,875
规模超过单一一周的作业
scale than single one week homeworks

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,625
会在这里，他看到了
would be here before and he saw it's

81
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,085
关于我没有给它我没有
about that I haven't given it I haven't

82
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,265
给你的详细信息，以便让我做到这一点与
given you details so let me do that with

83
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,125
一条消息，然后再问，但我
a message and then ask again but I'm

84
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,675
我希望你能理解我的想法
open to I hope you've understood I think

85
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,194
你有，如果你做
you have that that if you make

86
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,805
直接建议我的电子邮件
suggestions either directly to my email

87
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,335
或在广场或任何他们得到报酬
or on Piazza or whatever they get paid

88
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,085
注意好的米歇尔，你就去
attention to okay Michelle you just go

89
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,715
与最小二乘转发有啥
forward with least squares so what's the

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,965
最小二乘问题，这些是什么
least squares problem and what are these

91
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,884
每个人带来的四种方式让我这样
four ways each each bringing so let me

92
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,835
首先谈谈伪逆
speak about the pseudo-inverse first

93
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,474
好的矩阵的伪逆
okay the pseudo inverse of a matrix

94
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:42,685
好吧，所以我们有一个Mby矩阵
alright good so we have a matrix a M by

95
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,404
N和伪逆我要去
N and the pseudo-inverse I'm going to

96
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,634
叫一个加号，它自然就会发生
call a plus and it naturally it's gonna

97
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,694
我将会乘以那些
be n by M I'm going to multiply those

98
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,965
在一起，我会得到尽可能接近
together and I'm gonna get as near to

99
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,414
尽我所能，这是我的想法
the identity as I can that's the idea of

100
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,245
当然是伪逆的这个词
course of the pseudo-inverse the word

101
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,485
伪就在那里，所以没有人
pseudo is in there so so no one's

102
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,215
欺骗了它不是一个真正的逆哦
deceived it's not an actual inverse oh

103
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,605
如果矩阵是正方形并且有一个
if the matrix is square and has an

104
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,615
当然反过来，如果反过来
inverse of course then if if a inverse

105
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,495
存在哪个需要每个人
exists which which requires a everybody

106
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,715
记得它需要矩阵
remembers it requires the matrix to be

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,625
square是因为我的意思是两者相反
square because I mean inverse on both

108
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,685
双方和它需要完整的排名
sides and and it requires rank in full

109
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,985
等级然后你可以存在逆
rank then the inverse will exist you can

110
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,414
检查它MATLAB会检查它
check it MATLAB would check it by

111
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,124
计算消除的枢纽
computing the pivots in elimination

112
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,295
找到并转动所以如果反过来
finding and pivots so if a inverse

113
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,864
存在意味着a和a次a
exists which means a and a times a

114
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:54,274
逆和反两次给出
inverse and a inverse times a both give

115
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:04,384
然后我加一个当然是逆
I then a plus is a inverse of course the

116
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,694
伪逆是那里的逆
pseudo inverse is the inverse when there

117
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,304
是一个，但我正在考虑案件
is one but I'm thinking about cases

118
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:12,714
其中或者所述矩阵是矩形的
where either the matrix is rectangular

119
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:19,834
或者它具有零特征值就是它
or or it has zero eigenvalues it it's it

120
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,494
可以是正方形但具有零空间
could be square but has a null space

121
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,954
除了其他的零矢量
other than just the zero vector in other

122
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,164
这些列依赖于什么可以
words the columns are dependent what can

123
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,825
然后我们做反转它我们做不到
we do then about inverting it we can't

124
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,944
如果a有空，则逐字地反转它
literally invert it if if a has a null

125
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:40,264
然后当我乘以向量X时的空间
space then when I multiply by a vector X

126
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:44,524
在那个零空间ax将是零和
in that null space ax will be zero and

127
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,124
当我乘以倒数仍然为零时
when I multiply by a inverse still zero

128
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:51,334
这不能改变零，所以如果有
that can't change the zero so if there

129
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,884
是null空间中的X然后是这个
is an X in the null space then this

130
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,605
不可能发生，但我们只是做到最好
can't happen but so we just do the best

131
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,944
我们可以，这就是伪
we can and that's what the pseudo

132
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:03,424
逆是，所以让我画一幅画
inverse is and so let me draw a picture

133
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:06,304
你知道的那张照片
of the the picture you know of the row

134
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:12,124
空间和零空间没关系，这是
space and the null space okay and it's

135
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,374
在那里你看到有一个零空间和
there you see there is a null space and

136
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,574
在这里我有列空间和
over here I have the column space and

137
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,934
转置的零空间还可以
the null space of a transpose okay so

138
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,904
这是行空间当然是一个
this is the row space of course that's a

139
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,264
一个和一个转置的列空间
column space of a and of a transpose and

140
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:32,134
有一个好这样的列空间
there's the column space of a okay so

141
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,084
该图片的哪一部分是可逆的
which part of that picture is invertible

142
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,615
以及图片的哪一部分
and which part of the picture is

143
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,814
绝望的顶部是可逆的
hopeless the top part is invertible this

144
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,175
是我们的维度行
is the are sort of our dimensional row

145
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,084
空间我们的维柱空间a
space our dimensional column space a

146
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,564
在这里采取矢量zaps它进入
takes a vector in here zaps it into

147
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,875
每一个哦，你总是在列中
every oh you always end up in the column

148
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,894
这里的空间在这里我带一个矢量
space here here here I take a vector in

149
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:56,045
该
the

150
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,725
行空间说X，它被映射到ax
row space say X and it gets mapped to ax

151
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:06,425
在这两个空间之间是一个
and between those two spaces a is

152
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,715
完全可逆，你知道你得到了
entirely invertible you know you you get

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,695
这里单独的向量分开
separate vectors here go to separate

154
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,625
列空间中的向量和
vectors in the column space and the

155
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,225
反向只是把它带回来所以我们知道
inverse just brings it back so we know

156
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,524
什么伪逆应该做的
what the pseudo-inverse should do

157
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,785
我们会采取这样的方式
it'll take a we'll take go that way and

158
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:32,725
加上伪逆将是正义的
a plus the pseudo-inverse will be just

159
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,355
它会给我们的上半
it will give us on the top half of the

160
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,204
图片它会给我们一个加号，我们会采取
picture it'll give us a plus we'll take

161
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:46,894
现在斧头回到上半部分的x4
ax back to x4 in the in the top half now

162
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,625
这就是我们所拥有的
what about here that's where we have

163
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,144
麻烦我们没有那些破坏
trouble we don't have that's what spoils

164
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,334
如果有一个零空格，我们的逆
our inverse if there's a null space

165
00:09:54,339 --> 00:10:00,185
矢量然后它去你的地方
vector then it goes where when you

166
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,915
乘以null空间中的这个人
multiply by a this guy in the null space

167
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,255
通常沿着直线变为零
goes to zero usually along a straighter

168
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,045
行比我画，但去那里得到
line than I've drawn but go there gets

169
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,465
为零，所以你不能从提高它
to zero so you you can't raise it from

170
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,715
死者可以说你无法恢复
the dead so to speak you can't recover

171
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,995
你们其中一个人没有办法反过来
it one of you there's no way inverse so

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,935
我们必须考虑反向做什么
we have to think what shall a inverse do

173
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,865
在这里没有人的空间
to this space here where nobody's

174
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,625
击中它所以这就是这样
hitting it so it's this was this would

175
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:35,245
是转置的零空间，因为
be the null space of a transpose because

176
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,135
8/8对不起，应该是什么
8/8 sorry yeah what should the

177
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,925
伪逆我说的应该是什么
pseudo-inverse do I said what should the

178
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,505
反向做反过来是无奈的但是
inverse do the inverse is helpless but

179
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,015
我们必须要定义一个加号我说过
we have to to define a plus I've said

180
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,115
该怎么办呢
what it should do on that guy on the

181
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,635
列空间它应该采取一切
column space it should take everything

182
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,014
在它后面的列空间中
in the column space back where it came

183
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,935
从但它应在此做
from but what should it do on this

184
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,875
正交空间，耶，我告诉我
orthogonal space where yeah just tell me

185
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,265
如果我有什么，你会怎么想？
what what what do you think if I have

186
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,265
这里有一些矢量就是所谓的
some vector here that's it's called that

187
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,905
VR加一个会
V R plus one that would

188
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,385
就像这里在这里我有一个基础
be like so here here I have a basis of a

189
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:22,555
很好的列空间的良好基础
nice a nice basis for the column space

190
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,145
这个V我会用V代替
this V's I would use V's for the for the

191
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,545
那些出现在SVD中的人
ones that come up in the SVD they're

192
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,975
正交，它们来自正交
orthogonal and they come from orthogonal

193
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,485
使用，以便上半部分是伟大的
use so that top half is great what shall

194
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,805
我会用这些东西来做，我会发送的
I do with this stuff I'm gonna send that

195
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,765
加一个加号，我去哪里
back by a plus and where am I going what

196
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,455
我会把它发送给它知道
am I gonna do with it send it to know

197
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,495
在哪里它可以变为零是正确的
where else could it go zero is the right

198
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,195
回答所有这些东西都回归零
answer all this stuff goes back to zero

199
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,115
我正在寻找线性Mayton线性
I'm looking for a linear Mayton linear

200
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,115
算子矩阵，我不得不考虑
operator a matrix and I have to think of

201
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,275
一旦我决定如何处理所有人
once I've decided what to do with all

202
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,885
这些以及如何处理所有这些
those and what to do with all these then

203
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,565
我知道如何处理任何组合
I know what to do with any combination

204
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,865
所以我知道了我有这么所以
so I've got it I've got it so so the

205
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,925
这个想法对于X来说是真实的
idea will be this is true for X in the

206
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:24,695
如果是X，则行空间中X的行空间
row space for X in the row space if X is

207
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,915
在行空间中，ax位于列中
in the row space ax is in the column

208
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,075
空间和逆转只是把它带回来
space and a inverse just brings it back

209
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,855
因为它应该和在一个案例中
as it should and and in a in the case of

210
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,735
发生了可逆的矩阵
an invertible matrix a what happens to

211
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,805
我的照片是什么照片
my picture what does this picture

212
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,345
看起来如果a实际上是6乘
looking like if a is actually a six by

213
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,585
在这种情况下六个可逆矩阵
six invertible matrix in that case

214
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,615
什么是我的图片和什么是什么
what's what's in my picture and what is

215
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,845
所有这些零空间都不在我的照片中
not in my picture all this null space

216
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,265
东西不存在零空间
stuff isn't there a null space is just

217
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,655
零向量，但不论我做不
the zero vector but all that I don't

218
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,665
不得不担心，但总的来说我做
have to worry about but in general I do

219
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,785
不得不说，这样的一点是，
have to say so that the point is that a

220
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,355
加上我称之为什么
plus on the what what am i calling this

221
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,065
哦它是转置的空间或
ooh it's a null space of a transpose or

222
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:20,345
或者VR上的任何内容加上N到1
or whatever on on V R plus 1 to the N

223
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,255
那些虽然那些
those those though

224
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,625
那些人都是那些人
those all those vectors the the guys

225
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,995
那些不是正交的
that are not in the orthogonal to the

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,625
列空间然后你我们必须
column space then your your we have to

227
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,635
说什么加分对他们和他们做了什么
say what does a plus do to them and the

228
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,105
答案是它将所有这些都归零
answer is it takes them all to zero so

229
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,545
有一张照片使用我所说的
there's a picture using the what I call

230
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,465
线性代数的大图
the big picture of linear algebra the

231
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,825
你看到四个空格应该加分
four spaces you see what a plus should

232
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,995
现在我需要一个小公式
do now I need a little formula for it

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,385
我有一个我已经有了它的计划
I've got a I've got the plan for what it

234
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,915
应该是，而且它们有点像
should be and it's they're sort of a

235
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,575
自然的事情所以A加上你可以
natural thing so A plus a is you could

236
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,815
说它不是投影矩阵
say up it's a projection matrix it's not

237
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,315
单位矩阵因为因为如果是X.
the identity matrix because because if X

238
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,105
在零空间中加上ayayay
is in the null space a plus ay ay ay

239
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,885
加上a将把它归零，但是如此
plus a will take it to zero but so so

240
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,165
这是一个项目加一个是身份
it's a project a plus a is the identity

241
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,105
在上半部分，在底部为零
on the top half and zero on the bottom

242
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,775
那一半真的是那个
half that's that's really what the

243
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:32,285
矩阵是，现在我想要一个简单的
matrix is and now I want a simple

244
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,375
公式，而我想我的消息
formula for it and I guess my message

245
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,315
这里要说的是，如果我们正在寻找一个不错的
here is that if we're looking for a nice

246
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,155
表达式从SVD开始，因为
expression start with the SVD because

247
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,295
SVD适用于任何矩阵和它
the SVD works for any matrix and it

248
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,355
将其写为正交矩阵时间
writes it as an orthogonal matrix times

249
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,725
对角矩阵乘以正交
the diagonal matrix times an orthogonal

250
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,675
矩阵，现在我想反转它
matrix and now I want to invert it well

251
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,785
假设a的反转是什么
suppose a had an inverse what would that

252
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:10,325
如果这是F可逆的话
be if this is F invertible what would be

253
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,615
反向的SVD是什么的
the SVD of a inverse what would be the

254
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,405
奇异值分解，如果这样
singular value decomposition if if this

255
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,345
很好，所以这什么时候会好的
is good so when is this going to be good

256
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,875
什么会使我做什么
that what would that make what would I

257
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,915
必须知道那个矩阵西格玛
have to know about that matrix Sigma

258
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,435
中间的对角矩阵if
that diagonal matrix in the middle if

259
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,165
这确实是一个可逆矩阵以及
this is truly an invertible matrix well

260
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,085
知道那些不是它的名字
know what's its name those are not

261
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,025
特征值很好，我可以的价值
eigenvalues well there I can values of

262
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,235
a转置a但它们的奇异值
a transpose a but their singular value

263
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,305
奇异的紫罗兰很好，所以这就是
singular violets fine so that's the

264
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,005
奇异值矩阵和将会是什么
singular value matrix and what would be

265
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,305
如果a有反转的情况
the situation if if a had an inverse

266
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,345
所有人都没有零
there would be no zeros all their

267
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,995
奇异的价值观将坐在那里
singular values would be sitting there

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,755
Sigma12SigmaN会是什么样的
Sigma 1 2 Sigma N what would be the

269
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,115
这个Sigma矩阵的形状，如果我是
shape of this Sigma matrix if if if I

270
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,185
有一个逆，然后我必须它
have an inverse then I've it's got to be

271
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,845
广场和N所以它的形状是什么
square and by N so what's the shape of

272
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,305
西格玛的家伙也是正方形而且是如此
the Sigma guy also square and by n so so

273
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,235
可逆的情况将是，我
the invertible case would be and I'm

274
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,185
要消除这种在一分钟内
gonna erase this in a minute the

275
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,785
可转换的情况将是Sigma的时候
invertible case would be when Sigma is

276
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,755
只是那将是可逆的
just that that would be the invertible

277
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,765
如此让我们看看你能完成这个吗？
case so let's see can you finish this

278
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,965
公式什么是SVD
formula what would be the SVD of a

279
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,265
所以我给了我一个SVD
inverse so I've given the SVD of a I'm

280
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,115
鉴于U和这个西格玛很酷
given the U and this Sigma is cool and

281
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,895
V转置了与之相反的东西
the V transpose what's the inverse of

282
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,345
那
that

283
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,935
好吧，我真的在问你
well yeah I'm just really asking you

284
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,095
什么是该产品的反转
what's the inverse of that product of

285
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,125
这是第一个来自V的三个矩阵
three matrices what comes first here V

286
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,405
V转置的倒数是V的
the inverse of V transpose is V that's

287
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,335
因为V是正交矩阵
because V is a orthogonal matrix the

288
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,915
西格玛的倒数我只是1
inverse of Sigma I just 1 over it is

289
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,465
只是西格玛反转显然是什么
just the Sigma inverse it's obvious what

290
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,345
这意味着U的逆转
that means and the inverse of U would go

291
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,175
这里并为U转伟大确定，所以
here and that is U transpose great ok so

292
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,955
如果我们可逆，这是可逆的
this is f invertible if invertible we

293
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,665
知道逆转的SVD是什么
know what the SVD of a inverse is it

294
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,605
只需将V带回欧盟
just takes the V's back to the eu's

295
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,925
接受它或他们使用回到V的
takes it or they use back to the V's

296
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,505
无论哪个好，现在我们必须这样做
whichever ok ok now we've got to do it

297
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,375
如果我们要允许的话
if we're going to allow if we're gonna

298
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,585
超出这个限制的情况
get beyond this limit the situation

299
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,015
允许矩阵Sigma为矩形
allow the matrix Sigma to be rectangular

300
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,685
然后让我告诉你这个想法
then let me just show you how the idea

301
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,495
这里
here

302
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,345
所以现在我要说现在Sigma
so so now I'm gonna say now Sigma in

303
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,855
一般它的矩形它是我们的非
general its rectangular it's got our non

304
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,485
在对角线上零，但然后它退出
zeros on the diagonal but then it quits

305
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,585
所以它有一堆零
so it's it's got a bunch of zeros that

306
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,365
使它不可逆但是让我们做
to make it not invertible but let's do

307
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,495
我们最好和伪逆现在好了
our best and pseudo-inverse okay so now

308
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,345
我会帮助我开始一个公式
I'll help me get started on a formula

309
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,395
使用我想写这个加号
for using I want to write this a plus

310
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,725
就那里所描述而言
which are described up there in terms of

311
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,935
现在我要描述的子空间
the subspaces now I'm going to describe

312
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,285
关于Sigma和V的加分
a plus in terms of you Sigma and V the

313
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,455
在SVD的家伙还好，那应该是什么
in the SVD guys okay so what what shall

314
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,335
我从这里开始，让我给一个
I start with here well let me give a

315
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,455
暗示我只是这是一个很好的开始
hint I'll just that was a great start my

316
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,745
V仍然是正交矩阵V.
V is still an orthogonal matrix V

317
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,455
转置仍然是正交矩阵
transpose is still an orthogonal matrix

318
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,385
我会在最后反转它
I'll invert it at the end

319
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,065
U对所有问题都没有问题
the U was no problem all the problems

320
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,785
在Sigma和Sigma中都记得Sigma
are in Sigma and Sigma remember Sigma so

321
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,125
它是矩形的，也许我会成功
it's it's rectangular maybe I'll make it

322
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,575
喜欢广泛，也许我会
like wide for to wide and maybe I'll

323
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,054
只给它非零，然后全部
only give it to non zeros and then all

324
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,495
其余的，所以我的矩阵a的等级是2
the rest so the rank of my matrix a is 2

325
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,015
但是m和n大于2
but the m and n are bigger than 2 it's

326
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,445
它只有两个独立的列
it's just got two independent columns

327
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,015
然后它只是完全一点
and then then it's just sort of totally

328
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,275
单数好吧所以我的问题是什么
singular okay so my question is what am

329
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,674
我会把它放在那里，我已经描述过了
I going to put there and I've described

330
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:38,625
这是一种方式，但现在我要描述它
it one way but now I'm gonna describe it

331
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,715
另一种方式让我说出我的意思
another way well let me just say what I

332
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,755
我将放在那里的是伪
what I'll put there is the pseudo

333
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,625
西格玛的逆转我不能把西格玛
inverse of Sigma I can't put Sigma

334
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,985
反过来你使用那个符号，因为它
inverse you using that symbol because it

335
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,195
没有这样的事我不能
there is no such thing with this I can't

336
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,475
颠倒它，这是我能做到的最好的
invert it so that's the best I can do so

337
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,804
我差不多完成但是要完成我必须这样做
I'm almost done but to finish I have to

338
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,325
告诉你那是什么
tell you what does that

339
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,255
什么是这个东西，所以西格玛加
what what is this thing so Sigma plus

340
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,414
我现在要告诉你Sigmaplus和
I'm now going to tell you Sigma plus and

341
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,685
那就是应该坐在那里的东西
then that's what should sit there in the

342
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,414
如果西格玛是这个对角线那么中间
middle so if Sigma is this diagonal

343
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,654
在两个Sigma之后退出的矩阵
matrix which quits after two Sigma's

344
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,265
什么西格玛加上第一个好
what should Sigma plus be well first of

345
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,015
它应该是另一个矩形
all it should be rectangular the other

346
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,154
如果这是Mbyn列和
way if this was M by n column and

347
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,745
列和M行现在我想要n
columns and M rows now I want to have n

348
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:41,775
行和M列，是的，这是
rows and M columns and yeah here's the

349
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,085
质疑什么是最好的逆转你
question what's the best inverse you

350
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,475
能想出对于适马我的意思
could come up with for that Sigma I mean

351
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,315
如果有人独立于1806五，如果
if somebody independent of 1806 five if

352
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,105
有人要求你尽力反转
somebody asks you do your best to invert

353
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,525
那个矩阵我想我们都同意它
that matrix I think we'd all agree it is

354
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,475
是的，一个人会超过西格玛
yeah one over the Sigma one would come

355
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,674
那里有一个超过西格玛2然后非
there and one over Sigma two then non

356
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,284
零，然后零我认为你只是
zeros and then zeros I think you just

357
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,445
在那里，我们没有，我们没有
the way up there we didn't we didn't

358
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,164
知道该怎么做
know what to do

359
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:18,105
什么时候没有什么好做的零
when there was nothing good to do zero

360
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,534
是这样的答案是对的吗？
was there was the right answer so so

361
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,865
当然这都是零
this is all zeroes of course it's

362
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,085
另一种方式是矩形，但你看到了吗？
rectangular the other way but do you see

363
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,835
如果我乘以Sigma加倍
that if I multiply Sigma plus times

364
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,414
Sigma，如果我乘以伪逆
Sigma if I multiply the pseudo inverse

365
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,015
倍矩阵我会得到什么，如果我
times the matrix what do I get if I

366
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,945
乘以那就是那个
multiply that by that what does that

367
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,075
您可以描述乘法产品
multiplication produce can you describe

368
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,375
当你告诉我什么时，我还可以
the well or I can when you tell me what

369
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,475
看起来我会把它写下来所以
it looks like I'll write it down so what

370
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,525
如果Sigma是a，则是Sigma加上时间Sigma
is Sigma plus time Sigma if Sigma is a

371
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,375
对角线Sigmaplus是对角线和
diagonal Sigma plus is a diagonal and

372
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,804
两个人之后他们都退出了
they both quit after two guys what do I

373
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:04,935
有一个因为Sigma1倍1
have one because Sigma 1 times 1 over

374
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,075
Sigma1是1，另一个是下一个
Sigma 1 is a 1 and the other next guy is

375
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,525
a1，其余都是0，这是对的
a 1 and the rest are all 0 that's right

376
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,625
这是我能做到的最好的排名
it's the best I could do the rank was

377
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,985
只有两个，所以我无法到达任何地方
only two so I couldn't get anywhere so

378
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,415
这告诉你什么Sigmaplus是好的
that tells you what Sigma plus is okay

379
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,325
所以我描述了伪逆
so I described the pseudo-inverse then

380
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,174
用空间图片然后用
with a picture of spaces and then with a

381
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,105
矩阵的公式，现在我想
formula of matrices and now I want to

382
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,674
在最小的方格中使用它，所以现在我要去了
use it in least squares so now I'm going

383
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,255
说什么是最小二乘问题
to say what is the least squares problem

384
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,155
而解决它的第一种方法是
and the first way to solve it will be to

385
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,475
让我们做一个加号会给
let do to involve a plus will give the

386
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,924
解决方案好吧那是什么呢
solution okay so what is the what is the

387
00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:00,075
最小二乘问题让我把它放在这里
least squares problem let me put it here

388
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,304
[掌声]
[Applause]

389
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:07,405
好吧，最小二乘问题很简单
okay the least squares problem is simply

390
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:14,635
你有一个方程ax等于B但a是
you have an equation ax equal B but a is

391
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,775
不可逆的，所以你解决不了的
not invertible so you can't solve it of

392
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,765
当然对于这啊，你可以找到你
course for which yeah you could find you

393
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,255
可以解决这个问题对于某些B的，如果B是
could solve it for certain B's if B is

394
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,674
在a的列空间中只是通过
in the column space of a then just by

395
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,955
列空间的含义有一个
the meaning of column space this has a

396
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,475
解决列空间中的向量
solution the vectors in the column space

397
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,804
是你可以得到的那些人
are the guys that you can get but the

398
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:39,025
你在正交空间中的向量
vectors in the orthogonal space you

399
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,095
不能得到所有其他的向量
cannot get all the rest of the vectors

400
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,485
你不能这么想，就像这样
you cannot get so suppose this is like

401
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:53,685
所以但总是a是M乘n等级R和
so but always a is M by n rank R and

402
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:00,975
然后我们在M时得到一个逆
that that then we get a inverse when M

403
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,765
等于N等于R是可逆的
equals N equals R that's the invertible

404
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:11,005
caseok我们用什么做系统
case ok what do we do with a system of

405
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,385
我们无法解决它的方程式
equations when we can't solve it that's

406
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,605
这可能是主要的应用
this is probably the main application in

407
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:24,674
1806所以你以前见过这个问题
1806 so you've seen this problem before

408
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,895
如果ax等于B没有，我们该怎么办？
what do we do if ax equal B has no

409
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,955
解
solution

410
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,775
所以通常B将是一个向量
so typically B would be a vector of

411
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,145
我们正在追踪的测量结果
measurements like we're tracking a

412
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,365
卫星，我们得到一些测量
satellite and we get some measurements

413
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,965
但我们常常得到太多
but and often we get too many

414
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,035
测量，当然有一个
measurements and of course there's a

415
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,525
它们的噪音很小，噪音很小
little noise in them and a little noise

416
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,775
意味着我们无法解决方程式
means that we can't solve the equations

417
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,125
也许我们就是每个人的情况
that maybe we're the case everybody

418
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,995
知道这就是这个地方
knows is where a where this this

419
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,745
方程就像表达一个直
equation is like expressing a straight

420
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,205
线经过数据点所以
line going through the data point so the

421
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,135
这些广场的着名例子是
the famous example of these squares is

422
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:16,895
直线适合直线
fit a straight line a straight line to

423
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,635
B的2B1B2我们有他们
the B's 2 B 1 B 2 we've got em

424
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,595
测量我们有测量
measurements we've got em measurements

425
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,655
物理或的机制
the physics or the mechanics of the

426
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,295
问题是非常线性但是
problem is pretty well linear but of

427
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,325
当然有噪音和直
course there's noise and the straight

428
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,195
线只有两个自由度
line only has two degrees of freedom

429
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,605
但是我们只有两个
however so we're going to have only two

430
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,375
在我们的矩阵列将只有两个
columns in our matrix a will be only two

431
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,585
高很多行的列
columns with many rows highly

432
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,585
矩形所以适合直线让
rectangular so fit a straight line let

433
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,965
我打电话给CXPlusD说这是
me call that line CX Plus D say this is

434
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,435
X方向这是蜜蜂
the X direction this is the the bees

435
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,205
方向，我们有一大堆
direction and we've got a whole bunch of

436
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,625
数据点，他们不在一条线或
data points and they're not on a line or

437
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,585
他们是在一条线上什么我怎么会怎样
they are in a line what how would I how

438
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,935
假设那些人确实躺在线上
what suppose those did lie on the line

439
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,065
什么会告诉我关于斧头等于B
what would that tell me about ax equal B

440
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,685
我没有说过我需要的一切但是
I haven't said everything I need to but

441
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,025
也许洞察力就是我在这里所追求的
maybe the insight is what I'm after here

442
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:33,035
如果我，如果我的分数是正确的那么
if I if my points are right on a line so

443
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,355
有一条直线贯穿其中
there is a straight line through them

444
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,555
这里的未知数是如此之低B所以斧头
the unknowns here is so low B so ax the

445
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,754
这里有未知数
unknowns here are

446
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,164
C＆D和右手边都是我的
C&D and the right hand side is all my

447
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:56,374
测量好吧假设没有我的
measurements okay suppose without my

448
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:57,484
画一幅画
drawing a picture

449
00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:00,544
假设这些点上线
suppose the these points are on the line

450
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:03,454
这里是不同的X's
here here's the different X's the

451
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:05,734
测量x这里是不同的
measurement x here's the different

452
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:10,294
测量，但如果他们在一条线上
measurements but if they're on a line

453
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:13,474
那告诉我什么是线性的
what does that tell me about my linear

454
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:19,074
系统ax等于B它有一个解决方案
system ax equal B it has a solution

455
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,634
在一条线上意味着一切都是
being on a line means everything's

456
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,814
完美有一个解决方案，但会
perfect there is a solution but will

457
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,664
肯定有一个解决方案
there usually be a solution certainly

458
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:30,844
如果我只有两个参数两个，那就不行了
not if I have only two parameters two

459
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:36,514
未知两列这里的等级是
unknowns two columns here the rank is

460
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:39,274
会是两个，在这里我想
going to be two and here I'm trying to

461
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,764
击中任何嘈杂的测量值
hit any noisy set of measurements so of

462
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,594
一般来说，图片看起来很像
course in general the picture will look

463
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,844
那样的，我会找的
like that and I'm gonna look for the

464
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:58,685
最好的C和D所以我称之为CXCCX
best C and D so I'll call it C X C CX

465
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,144
加上D是的，对不起那就是我的
Plus D yeah right sorry that's that's my

466
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:09,534
那么那些是我的等式哦哦
line so those are my equation so oh

467
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,344
对不起，我经常把它写成C加DX吧
sorry I often write it C plus D X do you

468
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:17,464
如果我把常数术语放在首位，请注意
mind if I put the constant term first in

469
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:21,185
在高度困难的等式中
the in the highly difficult equation

470
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:28,144
这里是一条直线所以让我告诉你
here for a straight line so let me tell

471
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:31,324
你是我，所以这些是重点
you what I'm so these are the the points

472
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:34,084
你有一个测量X1X2的地方
where you have a measurement X 1 X 2 up

473
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,904
到XM，这些都是实际的
to X M and these are the actual

474
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:40,024
测量B1直到BM让我们说和
measurements B 1 up to BM let's say and

475
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:43,564
那我的方程式是啊
then my equations are yeah

476
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:45,784
我只想在这里设置你的矩阵
I'm just want to set up your matrix here

477
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:49,774
我只是想设置矩阵，所以我
I just want to set up the matrix so I

478
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,464
希望C得到每一个乘以
want C to get multiplied by ones every

479
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:56,645
时间，我想要契约
time and I want deed

480
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,215
得到乘以这些X的X1X2X3
get multiplied by these X's X 1 X 2 X 3

481
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,545
XM测量位置有
X M the measurement places and there was

482
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,045
无论如何测量和我的部分
a measurements anyway and the part my

483
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:15,545
问题是这没有解决方案等等
problem is this has no solution and so

484
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:19,855
那么当没有解决方案时我该怎么办？
so what do I do when there's no solution

485
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,085
好吧，我会做他所做的高斯
well well I'll do what gauss did he was

486
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,155
一个优秀的数学家，所以我会跟着他
a good mathematician so i'll follow his

487
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,205
意见，我也不会做这一切学期
advice and I won't do it all semester as

488
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,185
你懂
you know

489
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:40,325
所以，高斯的建议是最小化我
so but Gauss's advice was minimize I'll

490
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,835
责怪高斯的距离
blame it on the Gauss the distance

491
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,685
在ax+B之间平方l2范数
between a x + B squared the l2 norm

492
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:56,735
平方，这只是一个X.
squared which was which is just a X

493
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,405
减去B转置轴减去B它是a
minus B transpose ax minus B it's a

494
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,505
二次方和最小化它给了我一个
quadratic and minimizing it gives me a

495
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,565
线性方程组的系统，以便在端
system of linear equations so in the end

496
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,845
他们将有一个解决方案，所以这是
they will have a solution so that's the

497
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,065
我们有一个这些方块的整点
whole point of these squares we have an

498
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,165
不可解决的问题不是没有解决方案我们
unsolvable problem not no solution we

499
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,155
遵循高斯的建议，以获得最好的
follow a Gauss's advice to get the best

500
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,235
我们可以而且确实会产生答案
we can and that does produce an answer

501
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,525
所以这是这是，如果我乘这是
so this is this is if I multiply this as

502
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,725
出作为X变调转置斧子那
out as X transpose a transpose ax that

503
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,995
来自平方术语然后我
comes from the square term and then I

504
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,205
可能这些实际意志
have probably these actually will

505
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,065
可能我会得到其中的两个然后
probably I'll get two of those and then

506
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:52,385
一个具有导数0的常数项
a constant term that has derivative 0 so

507
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,055
它没有进入所以这就是我的意思
it doesn't enter so this is what I'm

508
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,515
最小化这是损失函数和
minimizing this is the loss function and

509
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,695
它导致让我们跳到这样
it leads to let's just jump to the so

510
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,465
这里的关键是我的方程式
the to the key here what equation do I

511
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,264
得到我的时候
get when I

512
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:15,274
什么方程式由最好的解决
for what equation is solved by the best

513
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,514
X最好的X最好的行为解决了
X the best X the best act solves the

514
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,264
着名所以这是回归和
famous so this is regression and

515
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:31,644
统计线性回归
statistics linear regression

516
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:35,464
其中一个主要的计算和
one of the main computations and

517
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:37,264
统计数据当然不仅仅是为了
statistics not of course just for

518
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:41,524
直线适合任何系统斧头
straight line fits but for any system ax

519
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:45,994
等于B将导致这个最小值
equal B that will lead to this minimum

520
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,634
将导致一个方程组
will lead to a system of equations that

521
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,065
我打算放一个盒子，因为
I'm going to put a box around because

522
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,714
它是如此根本，你愿意吗？
it's so fundamental and are you willing

523
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:59,134
告诉我这个等式是肯定的
to tell me what that equation is yes

524
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:03,544
感谢转置，它会来
thanks a transpose a it's gonna come

525
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:08,574
从那里你看到它倍数最好的x
from there you see it times the best x

526
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:18,664
等于给出的转置B.
equals a transpose B that gives the

527
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:19,704
最低限度
minimum

528
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:24,244
让我放弃检查你看到的
let me forego checking that you you see

529
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:26,704
二次项有矩阵
that the quadratic term has the matrix

530
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:30,004
在它，所以它的衍生物可能是
in it so it's derivative is may be may

531
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:32,195
这可以在导数是将
be the derivative of this is to a

532
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,815
转置斧头然后两个取消
transpose ax and then the two cancels

533
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,454
这两个也可以写
that two and this could also be written

534
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:44,824
因为X转置了转置B所以它是X.
as X transpose a transpose B so it's X

535
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,034
转反对转B中的
transpose against a transpose B that's

536
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,074
线性所以当我拿出衍生物
linear so when I take the derivative

537
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:55,134
这个国家的速度非常快
it's that country that's pretty fast

538
00:32:55,139 --> 00:33:04,234
1806会耐心地得出那个但是
1806 would patiently derive that but

539
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:08,584
在这里，我让我给你一张照片
here I let me give you the picture that

540
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:14,945
我喜欢几何学，所以我们拥有它们
goes with it the geometry so we have we

541
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:20,484
有问题我们没有解决方案
have the problem no solution we have

542
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:22,445
高斯
Gauss's

543
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,885
最佳答案最小化了规范
best answer minimize the to norm of the

544
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,475
错误我们有结论的矩阵
error we have the conclusion the matrix

545
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,485
我们进去了，现在我想画一个
that we get in and now I want to draw a

546
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,905
与之相关的图片好在这里
picture that goes with it okay so here

547
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:45,365
是我想要的照片
is a picture I want to I want to have

548
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,375
那张照片中的那个列空间
column space of a there in that picture

549
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,285
当然，列中的零向量
of course the zero vectors in the column

550
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,535
这是所有这一切的空间
space of a so this is this is all

551
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:05,925
可能的向量是正确的
possible vectors ax right

552
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,725
你永远不会忘记那个专栏
you're never forgetting that the column

553
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,515
太空是我现在所需要的所有X
space is all the a X's now I've got to

554
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,725
将B放在图片中，这样就可以了
put B in the picture so where does this

555
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,015
矢量B所以我试图解决ax等于
vector B so I'm trying to solve ax equal

556
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,424
B但是失败了，如果我画B的话怎么办？
B but failing so what if I draw B in

557
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,965
这张照片我怎么画B我在哪里
this picture how do I draw B where do I

558
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,385
把它
put it

559
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,155
我应该把它放在列空间没有
shall I put it in the column space no

560
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,985
整点是不是在
the whole point is it's not in the

561
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,335
列空间它不是一个斧头它出来了
column space it's not an ax it's out

562
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:46,664
某处有乙好，然后什么
there somewhere B okay and then what's

563
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,605
随之而来的几何形状
the geometry that goes with these

564
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,975
正方形和正规方程组
squares and the normal equations and

565
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,145
高斯建议尽量减少错误
Gauss's suggestion to minimize the error

566
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:01,305
究竟会在那里将斧头是最好的斧头
what will where will ax be the best ax

567
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,325
我能做到的
that I can do

568
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:08,325
那么高斯就是那么高斯
where will so so so Gauss is what Gauss

569
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,405
已经产生了另一个他
has produced is a an a the other he

570
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,585
找不到X他会尽力而为
can't find an X he'll do his best he can

571
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,015
我们称那个人为X帽子
and we're calling that guy X hat and

572
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,285
这是找到X帽子的代数
this is the algebra to find X hat and

573
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:29,145
现在这里的图片在哪里
now where's the picture here where is

574
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,685
这个矢量斧头帽是最好的ik
this vector ax hat which is the best ik

575
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,675
斧头我们可以得到它必须如此
ax we can get so it has to be

576
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,155
在列空间，因为它是一个时代
in the column space because it's a times

577
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,854
东西，哪里是它在列
something and where is it in the column

578
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:43,545
空间
space

579
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,025
它的投影是x的一半和
it's the projection that's a x half and

580
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,235
这是你不能做的错误
here's the error which you couldn't do

581
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,594
任何关于B减去XF的事情都是如此
anything about B minus a X F yeah so

582
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,165
这是所有的投射权
it's the projection right so that all

583
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:09,195
这证明了，所以我们是我们在
this is justifying the so we're we're in

584
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,455
这些方块的第二种方法
the second approach to these squares

585
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,395
求解正规方程求解
solves the normal equations solve the

586
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,515
正常的方程式是的，那将是
normal equations yeah that would be the

587
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,205
第二种方法是最小二乘和
second approach to least squares and

588
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,235
大多数例子，如果他们不是很大或
most examples if they're not very big or

589
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,385
你很难创建一个矩阵
very difficult you just creates a matrix

590
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:37,395
转置a并调用MATLAB和
a transpose a and you call MATLAB and

591
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,765
解决你创建的线性系统
solve that linear system you create the

592
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,655
矩阵你创建右手边
matrix you create the right hand side

593
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,985
你解决它，这是普通的
and you solve it so that's the ordinary

594
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,635
运行中的磨
run-of-the-mill

595
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,255
这些方块问题就是这么做的
these squares problems just do it so

596
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,804
方法2只是这样做
that's method 2 just do it

597
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:03,465
我们的方法3是什么方法
what's method 3 for the same we're

598
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,294
在这里谈论同样的问题但是
talking about the same problem here but

599
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:07,965
现在我想它可能会多一点
now I'm thinking it may be a little more

600
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:13,294
困难这个矩阵a转置a
difficult this matrix a transpose a

601
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:18,255
可能几乎是单数高斯
might be nearly singular Gauss is

602
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,094
假设是啊是啊，当这样做
assuming that yeah yeah when did this

603
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:25,425
什么时候工作，它会工作
work when did this work and it will

604
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:30,195
继续在未来三年这个工作
continue to work in the next three this

605
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:39,515
如果假设有一个，这是好的
works this is good if assuming a has

606
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:51,795
独立专栏
independent columns

607
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,455
你更好地说清楚我声称
ya better just make clear I'm claiming

608
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,305
当a还没有那么是什么的时候
that when a hasn't so what's the what's

609
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,555
如果a具有独立性的推理
the reasoning if a has independent

610
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,975
列但可能没有足够的列
columns but maybe not enough columns

611
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,705
像这里一样，它只有两列
like here it's only got two columns

612
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,355
这显然无法做到
that's obviously not going to be able to

613
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,935
匹配任何右手边，但它有
match any right hand side but it's got

614
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,425
独立柱时，有
independent columns when a has

615
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,795
独立专栏然后我能说什么
independent columns then what can I say

616
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,355
关于这个矩阵，它是可逆的
about this matrix it's invertible

617
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,365
如果一个人有独立的话，高​​斯的计划就有效
Gauss's plan works if a has independent

618
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,685
然后这将是一个线性的列
columns then this would be a linear

619
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,625
代数步骤然后这将是
algebra step then this will be

620
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,115
你可以看到它的重要性
invertible you see the importance of

621
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,425
如果a具有独立列，则该步骤
that step if a has independent columns

622
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,995
这意味着它只有X空值
that means it has no null space only X

623
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,935
等于零处于零空间中的两个
equal zero is in the null space two

624
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,625
独立的列，但只有两个没有
independent columns but only two so not

625
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,655
足以解决系统但独立
enough to solve systems but independent

626
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,415
那么这个矩阵就可以了
then you're okay this matrix is

627
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,845
可逆的你可以做高斯所说的
invertible you can do what Gauss tells

628
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:04,165
你，但我们现在已经准备好了
you but we're prepared now we have to

629
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:11,065
想想，我真正想要的是什么
think okay so that what do I really want

630
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,755
要做我想要连接这个高斯的
to do I want to connect this Gauss's

631
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,645
因为伪逆的解决方案
solution to the pseudo inverse because

632
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,715
我声称他们都给了同样的东西
I'm claiming they both give the same

633
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,905
结果伪逆是的
result the pseudo inverse yeah the

634
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:33,055
伪逆将适用但我们有
pseudo inverse will apply but we have we

635
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,265
有喜欢的事，这是一个不
have like something this a is not

636
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,725
可逆的只是保持记忆
invertible just keep keep remembering

637
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:44,415
这个矩阵不可逆，但它是
this matrix it's not invertible but it's

638
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,625
它有独立的专栏我是什么
it has got independent columns what am i

639
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,995
他说，他们只是刚刚要回
saying they're just just going back to

640
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,075
图片
the picture

641
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,215
如果ahas是一个独立的矩阵
if if a has is a matrix with independent

642
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,825
列这个空间消失了
columns what space disappears in this

643
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:08,855
图片零空间消失了所以
picture the null space goes away so the

644
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,355
图片更简单，但它仍然是
picture is simpler but it's still the

645
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,295
这是一个转置的零空间
null space of a of a transpose this is

646
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,115
仍然很大，因为我只有两个
still pretty big because I only had two

647
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,385
列和一大堆行和
columns and a whole lot of rows and

648
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,335
这将在这里反映出来
that's gonna be reflected here

649
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,565
那么我想说的是什么呢
so what what am I trying to say I'm

650
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,785
想说这个答案是
trying to say that this answer is the

651
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,875
和伪逆回答一样吗？
same as the pseudo-inverse answer do we

652
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,725
甚至可能检查这一点
could possibly even check that point let

653
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,195
我先把它写下来
me write it down first

654
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:52,265
我声称答案加上B是
I claim that the answer a plus B is the

655
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,285
与来自这里的答案相同a
same as the answer coming from here a

656
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:04,345
当我转换一个倒转转换B.
transpose a inverse a transpose B when I

657
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:11,615
猜测等级空零是零
guess the null space is zero the rank is

658
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,485
无论你喜欢什么，我都说
all of em whatever you like to say I

659
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:20,125
相信那个方法就是这个
believe that that that method one this

660
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:24,515
用一个快速的公式来记住它
to it in one quick formula so remember

661
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:32,195
这是VSigmaplusutranspose
that this was V Sigma plus u transpose

662
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,645
这是一个转置是什么
right that's what a a transpose was that

663
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:44,105
这应该与此相信
this should agree with this I I believe

664
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:49,295
当零空间时，它们是相同的
those are the same when the null space

665
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,085
是不是在图片中这样的事实
isn't in the picture so the fact that

666
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,395
零空间仅仅是一个零向量
the null space is just a zero vector

667
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,185
意味着这反过来就是这样
means that this in this inverse does

668
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:02,075
存在所以这种逆存在但是aa
exist so this inverse exists but but a a

669
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,175
转置是不可逆的
transpose is not invertible

670
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:12,645
没有等不倒，因为aa
right no wait no inverse because a a

671
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:17,055
转置即将到来
transpose would be coming with a

672
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,755
转置所有这是一个空的空间
transpose all this is a null space of a

673
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,005
转置所以转置不是
transpose so a transpose is not

674
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:28,965
可逆的，但转换a是
invertible but but a transpose a is

675
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,665
你怎么会检查
invertible could you how would you check

676
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:37,505
你知道我什么时候才这样
that you see when i'm it's taken like

677
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,165
几乎整个小时获得
pretty much the whole hour to get a

678
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:45,645
的几何形状的图片
picture of the geometry of the

679
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,045
伪逆，所以这是伪
pseudo-inverse so this is the pseudo

680
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:55,025
逆，这就是那个矩阵
inverse and this is that matrix there

681
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,065
你知道它真的做到了最好
what you know it's really doing its best

682
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,425
事实上每个人都是反过来的
to be the inverse in fact everybody here

683
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,915
就像做他们最好是
is just like doing their best to be the

684
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,515
现在反过来这有多接近
inverse now how well is this how close

685
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,305
是我可以反过来
is that to being the inverse can I just

686
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,985
问你这个，然后我会做
ask you about that and then I'll make

687
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,325
这种联系然后我们就出局了
this connection and then we're out of

688
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,625
时间的接近程度，要作为
time how close is that to being the

689
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,755
反过来假设我乘以那个
inverse of a suppose I multiply that by

690
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:30,255
我能得到什么，所以只要注意我
a what do I get so so just notice if I

691
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,195
乘以我得到的东西
multiply that by a what do I get

692
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:46,005
我得到是的，我觉得我很棒，但不是
I get yeah I get I terrific but don't be

693
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,555
被骗以为这是
deceived to thinking that this is the

694
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,505
它的倒数只有它起作用了
inverse of a it only it worked on the

695
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,935
左侧，但它不会是好的
left side but it's not going to be good

696
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,485
在右边，所以如果我尝试，如果我
on the right-hand side so if I try if I

697
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:05,735
在这个方向乘以这个家伙
multiply a by this guy in that direction

698
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,895
我会像身份一样接近
I'll get like as close to the identity

699
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,635
因为我可以来，但我不会得到
as I can come but I won't get the

700
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,915
这样的身份所以这就是这个
identity that way so this is this a

701
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,184
小盒子说
little box to say

702
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:19,405
那么制作我是什么意思
so what's the point of making I'm

703
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:22,574
声称这是伪逆
claiming that this is the pseudo-inverse

704
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:27,174
无论这些空间是什么雨
whatever whatever these spaces the rain

705
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:31,645
可能很小只是这个有效
could be tiny just just one this works

706
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,804
当排名在我需要的时候
when the rank is in this I needed

707
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,415
独立的列，所以当排名是
independent columns so when the rank is

708
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,844
所以这是等级和那个
in so this is rank equal and that that

709
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:48,385
高斯工作，然后就可以得到一个接着一个
Gauss worked then I can get a one then

710
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,324
这是一个片面的反转，但它不是一个
it's a one-sided inverse but it's not a

711
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:54,504
双面逆我不能这样做，但我的
two-sided inverse I can't do that but my

712
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:57,114
那里的矩阵我可以找到片面的
matrix there I could find a one-sided

713
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,314
反过来获得2比2的身份，但我
inverse to get the 2 by 2 identity but I

714
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:02,214
永远不会
could never

715
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:05,094
乘以一些矩阵得到
multiply that by some matrix and get the

716
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,064
Nbyn认同那两个可怜的人
N by n identity those two pathetic

717
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:11,145
列没关系
columns okay

718
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,204
也许你觉得只是检查一下
maybe you feel like just checking this

719
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:17,364
只需要耐心，我的意思是什么
just takes patience what do I mean by

720
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:26,064
检查它我的意思是坚持伪
checking it I mean stick in the pseudo

721
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:30,354
SVD刚放入SVD和
the the SVD just put in the SVD and

722
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:33,504
像疯了一样取消，我想那就是
cancel like crazy and I think that'll

723
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:38,635
弹出你喜欢相信我因为它
pop out do you like believe me cuz it's

724
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,994
要认识你，会有点痛苦
gonna be a little painful 3 you know you

725
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:45,054
说我的V转置所有转置和
say my V transpose all transposed and

726
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:46,434
然后有东西，突然有
then something there and suddenly there

727
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:50,875
我有9个矩阵相乘但是
I've got 9 matrices multiplying away but

728
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,125
它会像各种各样的东西
it's gonna like how all sorts of things

729
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,524
将产生身份，最终
will produce the identity and in the end

730
00:45:55,529 --> 00:45:59,604
这就是我所拥有的权利
that's what I'll have right right yep so

731
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:03,385
这就是这就是它
that's this is the this is the it's a

732
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,824
SVD的片面真逆
one-sided true inverse where the SVD

733
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:11,304
这个配方准备都没有
this formula is prepared to have neither

734
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:15,174
我们知道什么是可逆的
side invertible it's still we know what

735
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:19,944
Sigmaplus意味着无论如何都是如此
Sigma plus means anyway so under the

736
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:23,094
假设独立列高斯
assumption of independent columns Gauss

737
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,454
工作并给出与他们相同的答案
works and gives the same answer as their

738
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:29,375
伪逆
pseudo inverse

739
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,605
好吧三分钟
okay three minutes

740
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:38,835
这不是时间，但这是一个
that's hardly time but this being a

741
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,755
我觉得我应该用它哦天啊
mighty I feel I should use it oh my god

742
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,645
排名第三的是三号
number three so what's number three

743
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:56,025
关于第三是是是作为
about number three is is a is a as the

744
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,295
与第二个相同的要求相同
same requirement as number two the same

745
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,485
要求没有零空间，但它说
requirement of no null space but it says

746
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,755
如果我能先获得正交列
if I could get orthogonal columns first

747
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,625
那么这个问题就很容易了
then this problem would be easy so

748
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,995
大家都知道克施密特是一个
everybody knows that gram-schmidt is a

749
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,105
无聊的方式来自于
way boring way to get from from from

750
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,895
这两列得到两个正交
these two columns to get two orthogonal

751
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,555
列实际上是整个想法
columns actually the whole idea of

752
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,205
克施密特已经在那里了
gram-schmidt is already there for

753
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,485
因此我有两分钟
two-by-two so with so I have two minutes

754
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,025
我们可以做到让我们看看让我们做
and we can do it let's see let's do

755
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,235
克-施密特在这两列专栏上
gram-schmidt on these two columns column

756
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,555
列一列列，您会计我
column a column column you accountant I

757
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,505
不想使用U和V列y和z
don't want to use U and V column y&z

758
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,635
好吧，假设我想要正交化
okay suppose I want to orthogonalize

759
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,645
那些家伙是什么是克施密特的想法
those guys what's the gram-schmidt idea

760
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,265
我认为为什么这是非常好的不
i take why it's perfectly good no

761
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,545
y的问题是y向量
problem with y there's the y vector

762
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,905
他们都是那个人然后这个人不是
they're all ones then this guy is not

763
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:08,535
可能是正交的，它会消失
orthogonal probably to that it'll go off

764
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,354
还有一些在这个方向上有一个
and some this in this direction with an

765
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,505
这个角度不是九十度那么
angle that's not ninety degrees so what

766
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,735
我是否想要获得正交向量
do i do i want to get orthogonal vectors

767
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,755
我对第一个人没关系，但是
I'm okay with this first guy but the

768
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,765
第二个人与第一个人不正交
second guy isn't orthogonal to the first

769
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,525
所以我该怎么办
so what do I do

770
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,805
我如何在这张照片中如何来
how do I in this picture how do I come

771
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:35,864
使用与Y项目正交的向量
up with a vector orthogonal to Y project

772
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:38,925
我可以拿这个Z而且我拿它
I could I take this Z and I take its

773
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:43,025
投影所以Z有一点点
projection so Z has a little piece

774
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,365
Z矢量有一点点大块
that Z vector has a little big piece

775
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:49,125
已经朝Y的方向了
already in the direction of what Y which

776
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,825
我不想和一块正交的
I don't want and a piece orthogonal to

777
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,555
它这是我的另一片这是我的其他
it that's my other piece that's my other

778
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,135
因此，这就是为什么，这里是
piece so here's why and here's the the

779
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,735
这是Z减去负数a
this is that is Z minus the minus a

780
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,705
投影让我只是说不管是啊
projection let me just say whatever yeah

781
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,535
我不知道我是否画了这张照片
I don't know if I even drew that picture

782
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,205
右大概我没有什么反正
right probably I didn't anyway whatever

783
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:15,845
克-施密特的想法是公正的
the the gram-schmidt idea is just

784
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,825
以自然的方式正交化哦，我会
orthogonalize in the natural way oh I'll

785
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,445
回到那个开头
come back to that at the beginning of

786
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:24,645
下次再谈一谈
next time and say a word about the

787
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:28,935
第四种方式，但所以这个最小的方块
fourth way but but so this least squares

788
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,165
是不深入学习它是什么人
is is not deep learning it's what people

789
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,665
一个世纪以前，并继续做
did a century ago and continue to do for

790
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:41,235
很好的理由没关系，我会送出去的是
good reason okay and I'll send out that

791
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,305
关于班级和你的公告
announcement about the class and you

792
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,220
know the homework and you know the new

793
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:50,890
知道功课，你知道新的

794
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:50,890
截止日期是周五好，谢谢
due date is Friday good thank you
