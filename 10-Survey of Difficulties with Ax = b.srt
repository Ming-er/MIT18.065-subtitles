00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,815
好的，如果你想知道的话，那就去吧
okay let's go so if you want to know the

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,345
今天的班斧它等于B的主题
subject of today's class its ax equal B

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,485
我开始写不同的了
I got started writing down different

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,635
斧头等于B的可能性我得到了
possibilities for ax equal B and I got

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,465
走开了
carried away

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,315
它只是出现了
there's it just appears all over the

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,885
地方和四种不同的大小
place and the four different sizes

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,345
不同级别的不同情况
different ranks different situations

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,785
几乎奇异而不是单数和
nearly singular not nearly singular and

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,245
问题是你在每个方面做了什么
the question is what do you do in each

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,795
我可以概述一下我的小二
case so can I outline my little two

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,144
这里的笔记页然后选择一个
pages of notes here and then pick on one

21
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:13,394
或者今天要开发的其中两个主题
or two of these topics to develop today

22
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:18,065
多一点上周五约
and a little more on Friday about

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,885
克施密特所以我不会做太多的事情
gram-schmidt so I won't do much of much

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,315
如果有任何克施密特今天，但我会
if any of gram-schmidt today but I will

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,395
做其他人没关系
do the others okay

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,125
所以问题是斧头等于B
so the problem is ax equal B that

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,985
问题来自我们所拥有的某个地方
problem has come from somewhere we have

28
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,645
产生某种答案X好吧
to produce some kind of an answer X okay

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,325
所以我有点从好到坏
so I'm sort of going from good to bad or

30
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,294
这份清单中的好或难
good or easy to difficult in this list

31
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,605
很好，除了数字零，这是
so well except for number zero which is

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,255
在所有情况下使用的答案
an answer in all cases the using the

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,805
我最后介绍的伪逆
pseudo-inverse that I introduced last

34
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,805
时间，以便处理零特征值
time so that deals with zero eigenvalues

35
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,904
和零奇异值说
and zero singular values by saying

36
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,635
他们是逆也是0，这是善良的
they're inverse is also 0 which is kind

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,925
狂野的，所以我们会回来的
of wild so we'll come back to the

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,115
伪逆的意义，但现在
meaning of the pseudo inverse but now

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,845
我想在这里变得真实
I'm I want to get real here about

40
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,605
第一个是不同的情况
different situations so number one is

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,105
一个人有一个好的正常情况
the good normal case when a person has a

42
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,125
合理大小的方阵
square matrix of reasonable size

43
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,595
合理状态的条件
reasonable condition the condition

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,814
数字o我应该的条件数
number o the condition number I should

45
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,325
称之为Sigmaone
call it Sigma one

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,805
在Sigmañ它是最大的比例
over Sigma n it's a ratio of the largest

47
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,865
到最小的奇异值和让我们
to the smallest singular value and let's

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,135
说这个理由不超过一个
say that's within reason not more than a

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,905
一千或一些正常
thousand or something then normal

50
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,605
普通淘汰将会起作用
ordinary elimination is going to work

51
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,995
和MATLAB的命令会
and MATLAB the command that would

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,355
产生答案只是反斜杠但是
produce the answer is just backslash but

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,075
所以现在这是正常情况的情况下
so this is the normal case now in cases

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,505
一些跟随或有问题
that follow or have problems of some

55
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,195
亲切的，我想我希望这是
kind and I guess I'm hoping that this is

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,575
什么是有用的字典
a sort of useful dictionary of what to

57
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,095
为你和我做的都好，所以我们
do for for you and me both okay so we

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,405
我们也有这种情况
have this case here where we have too

59
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,675
许多方程式因此非常正常
many equations so it's a pretty normal

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,835
案例，这是我们主要想到的
case and it's the we'll think mostly of

61
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,075
用最小二乘法解决这个问题
solving by least squares which leads us

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,355
这是正常的等式
to the normal equation so this is

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,665
标准一直在发生
standard happens all the time in

64
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,005
统计和我想的
statistics and I'm thinking in the

65
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,655
合理的情况就是这样
reasonable case so that's that would be

66
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,265
X解决方案一转这个
X hat the solution a transfer this this

67
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,715
矩阵是可逆的
matrix would be invertible and

68
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,734
合理的大小，所以我们可以
reasonable size so we could actually

69
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,265
反斜杠仍然可以解决这个问题
backslash would still solve that problem

70
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,204
反斜杠不需要正方形
backslash doesn't require a square

71
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,625
矩阵给你一个答案，这样就可以了
matrix to give you an answer so that's

72
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,755
你会这样做的好例子
that's the good case where you would

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,605
只是矩阵不是太大，所以它的
just the matrix is not too big so it's

74
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,695
形成转置并不是不合理的
not unreasonable to to form a transpose

75
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,525
好吧现在还有另一个极端
a okay now there is the other extreme

76
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,725
对我们来说令人兴奋的是这样的
and like what's exciting for us is so

77
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,275
这是我不知道的欠定情况
this is the underdetermined case I don't

78
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,215
有足够的方程，所以我必须把
have enough equations so I have to put

79
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,435
更具体的东西
something more in to get a specific

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,615
回答以及让我们感到兴奋的是什么
answer and what makes it exciting for us

81
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,355
这是深度学习的典型
is that that's typical of deep learning

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,245
深沉的重量如此之多
there are so many weights in a deep

83
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,305
神经网络的权重将
neural network that the weights would be

84
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,275
未知数
the unknowns

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,255
它不一定是线性的
it wouldn't be necessarily linear

86
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,495
不是线性的，但仍然是这个想法
wouldn't be linear but still the idea is

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,884
同样我们有很多解决方案
the same that we we have many solutions

88
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,785
我们必须选择一个或我们必须
and we have to pick one or we have to

89
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,585
选择一个算法，然后它会找到
pick an algorithm and then it will find

90
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,775
一个，所以我们可以选择最低限度
one and so we could pick the minimum

91
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,175
规范解决方案最短的解决方案
norm solution the shortest solution that

92
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,505
将是一个l2答案或我们可以去
would be an l2 answer or we could go to

93
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,365
l1和我认为的一个大问题
l1 and a big question that's I think

94
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,855
可能在2018年定居的确很深
might be settled in 2018 is does deep

95
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,235
学习和迭代
learning and the iteration from

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,975
随机梯度下降，我们将
stochastic gradient descent that we'll

97
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,195
很快就会看到它
see soon pretty soon does it go to the

98
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,655
最小L什么它挑选了l1
minimum L what does it pick out an l1

99
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,605
解决方案，这真的像一个
solution that that's really like an

100
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,175
你知道的令人兴奋的数学问题
exciting math question you know for a

101
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,485
很长一段时间，它有点标准
long time it was sort of standard to say

102
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,585
这些深度学习的AI代码是
these deep learning AI codes are

103
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,015
太棒了，但他们在做什么呢
fantastic but what are they doing we

104
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,645
不知道
don't know

105
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,705
你知道内部但我们何时何地
you know the interior but where we when

106
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,825
我说我们并不是说其他人
I say we I don't mean I other people are

107
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,505
到那里，我会告诉你的
getting there and I'm gonna tell you as

108
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,595
当我们到达那里时，就像我能做到的那样
much as I can about it when we get there

109
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,985
好的，这些都很标准
okay so that's those are pretty standard

110
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:24,255
情况M等于N且大于它们M.
cases M equals N and greater than them M

111
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,664
不到n但不疯狂现在让
less than n but not crazy okay now let

112
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,515
我第二板会有更多
me the second board will have like more

113
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,055
困难的问题通常是因为
difficult problems where usually because

114
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,245
它们在某种程度上几乎是单数的
they're nearly singular in some way the

115
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,275
列几乎是依赖的好吧
columns are nearly dependent okay so

116
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,255
寻找那将是的列
look for that would be the columns in

117
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,605
糟糕的情况你刚刚挑选了一个可怕的
bad condition you just picked a terrible

118
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,855
基础或性质做了或不知何故你
basis or nature did or somehow you've

119
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,455
得到一个列为a的矩阵
got a matrix a whose columns are

120
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,545
实际上几乎线性地依赖
virtually dependent almost linearly

121
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,664
依赖逆矩阵是真的
dependent the inverse matrix is really

122
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,805
但它存在的时候就是你
but it exists then that's when you you

123
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,375
进去，你修复了你的列
go in and you fix the columns you

124
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,605
地正交列，而不是
orthogonalize columns instead of

125
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,384
接受a1a2到a的列
accepting the columns a 1 a 2 up to a n

126
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,105
你进去的给定矩阵和你
of the given matrix you go in and you

127
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,884
在其中找到正交列向量
find orthonormal column vectors in that

128
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,224
列空间正交基Q1到
column space an orthonormal basis Q 1 to

129
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,075
将q个n和两个由连接
Q n and the two are connected by

130
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,435
克施密特和着名的矩阵
gram-schmidt and the famous matrix

131
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,045
克施密特的声明就在这里
statement of gram-schmidt is here are

132
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,895
这里的列是列的列
the columns of a here are the columns of

133
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,995
Q并且有一个三角矩阵
Q and there's a triangular matrix that

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,495
连接两者，这是一个中心
connects the two so that is a central

135
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,455
主题克-施密特在那个想法中
topic gram-schmidt in that idea of

136
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,435
正交Ising它刚刚出现
orthogonal Ising it just appears

137
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,405
到处都是六对
everywhere pairs all over course six in

138
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,495
与许多不同的情况很多
many many situations with different

139
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,005
这些名字让我有点拯救了
names so that I'm sort of saving a

140
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,914
一点点，直到下一次，让我
little bit till next time and let me

141
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,865
告诉你为什么因为只是
tell you why because just the

142
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,965
格拉姆-施密特的组织
organization of gram-schmidt is

143
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,534
有趣的是你可以做的克施密特
interesting so gram-schmidt you could do

144
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,615
正常的方式，这就是我教的内容
the normal way so that's what I teach in

145
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,965
1806就这样只需要每一列
1806 just just take every column as it

146
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,175
自带减去关闭突起到
comes subtract off projections onto

147
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,204
他们以前的东西让它正交
their previous stuff get it orthogonal

148
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:38,045
以前的人归它是
to the previous guys normalize it to be

149
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,295
一个单位向量然后你就有了
a unit vector then you've got that

150
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,904
专栏继续说再说再说
column go on sorry say that again and

151
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,084
然后我会再过两天再说一遍
then I'll say it again two days from now

152
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,965
所以克施密特的想法是你拿走了
so gram-schmidt the idea is you take the

153
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,355
你说第二列的列是
columns you you say the second column is

154
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,425
一些常见的第二正交矢量Q2
some common second orthogonal vector Q 2

155
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,915
将是第一列的一些组合
will be some combination of columns one

156
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,555
和两个正交于第一个ya
and two orthogonal to the first ya

157
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,475
什么是欲望，而且有
what's lust to do and and there's

158
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,105
另一个真正的订单
another order which is really

159
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,074
更好的命令做克-施密特和
the better order to do gram-schmidt and

160
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,274
它允许你进行列旋转
it allows you to do column pivoting so

161
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,764
这是我下次要看的主题
this is my topic for next time to see

162
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,745
克-施密特更加认真对待
gram-schmidt more carefully right

163
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,665
好吧是的列旋转意味着你
okay yeah column pivoting means you

164
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,185
让自己带你去
allow yourself to take the you the

165
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,245
列可能不是很好
columns might not come in a good order

166
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:46,915
所以你允许自己重新排序我们
so you allow yourself to reorder them we

167
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,305
知道你有这样做的
know that you have to do that for

168
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,045
消除权利和消除权利
elimination right and in the elimination

169
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,985
这将是行，所以消除我们会
it would be rows so elimination we would

170
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:04,195
有一个矩阵a和它我们采取的
have a the matrix a and its we take the

171
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,505
第一行作为第一个枢轴行和
first row as the first pivot row and

172
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,945
然后是第二行，然后是第三行
then the second row and then the third

173
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,155
行，但如果枢轴是如此，如果
row but if the pivot is so that if the

174
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:24,135
pivot太小并重新排序行
pivot is too small and reorder the rows

175
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,305
所以这是它自带的行排序
so it's it's its row ordering that comes

176
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:39,444
在消除和你很好的MATLAB
up in elimination and you well MATLAB

177
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,985
只是系统地说好的就是
just systematically says okay that's the

178
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,715
枢纽即将成为第三个支点
pivot that's coming up the third pivot

179
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,954
出现了第三排，但MATLAB的
comes up out of the third row but MATLAB

180
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,415
说看看整个第三列
says look down that whole third column

181
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,144
为了更好的枢轴更大的枢轴开关
for a better pivot a bigger pivot switch

182
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,875
我们做一排交换所以有
do we do a row exchange so there are

183
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,035
大量排列的，那么你最终会
lots of permutations then you end up

184
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,725
那里有一些东西可以让人感觉到
with a something there that permutes the

185
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,635
这被计入行，然后
rows and then that gets factored into

186
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,805
列欧，所以我说的是关于
Leu so I'm saying something that about

187
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,644
消除那种只是偏执的一面
elimination that that just sort of side

188
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,584
评论你永远不会做
comment that you you would never do

189
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,465
消除而不考虑
elimination without considering the

190
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,285
行交换的可能性然后
possibility of row exchanges and then

191
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,845
这是
this is

192
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,405
克-施密特正交化所以这个
gram-schmidt orthogonalization so this

193
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,384
这里的Lu世界是QR世界和
is the Lu world here's the QR world and

194
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:35,884
这恰好是那列
here it happens to be columns that

195
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,004
你正在通勤，以便即将到来
you're commuting so that's coming that

196
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:47,465
这是第2.2节，但有更多
this is section 2.2 but there's more a

197
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,884
2.2中有相当多的内容
2.2 has quite a bit in it including

198
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,595
数字0伪逆和
number 0 the pseudo-inverse and

199
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,784
包括一些这些东西实际上
including some of these things actually

200
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:59,254
这也将是2.0，也许这个
this will be also in 2.0 and maybe this

201
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:02,824
就是我今天想说的更多
is what I'm like saying more about today

202
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,764
所以这将成为一个小明星
so this would be a put a little star for

203
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:10,144
今天你在这做什么，这是一个
today here what do you do so this is a

204
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:15,024
矩阵几乎是单数的情况
case where the matrix is nearly singular

205
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,854
你是危险的，它是逆的
you're you're in danger its inverse is

206
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:21,394
会变得无比大而我
gonna be big unreasonably big and I

207
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,684
写了反问题，因为
wrote inverse problems there because

208
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:30,114
反问题就是这种类型
inverse problem is that's a type of

209
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:33,064
你需要申请的问题
problem that you need application that

210
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,694
你经常需要解决，或者你的
you often need to solve or that you the

211
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:39,725
工程和科学有
engineering and and science have to

212
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,204
解决
solve

213
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,034
所以我再说一点
so I'll just say a little more about

214
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:46,114
但这是一个典型的应用程序
that but that's a typical application in

215
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:50,554
你得到你的近乎单一的你的
which you get your near singular your

216
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,824
矩阵不够好，无法很好地反转
matrix isn't good enough to invert well

217
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,655
你当然可以说得好
of course you could over say well I'll

218
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,894
只是用伪逆但是这
just use the pseudo inverse but that's

219
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,604
在数字上，这就像欺骗你一样
numerically that's like cheating you've

220
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,854
得到你必须进入那里做
got a you got to get in there and do

221
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:03,905
关于它的事情
something about it

222
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,475
所以反问题就是例子
so inverse problems would be examples

223
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,334
实际上，正如我写的那样，我认为
actually as I write that I think that

224
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:14,794
将是我应该添加的主题
would be a topic that I should add that

225
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,074
到a的潜在主题列表
to the list of potential topics for a

226
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:20,194
一个为期三周的项目来查找
for a three week project to look up a

227
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,164
关于反问题的书，我该怎么办？
book on inverse problems so what do I

228
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,874
我只是反问题的意思
mean by the inverse problem I'll just

229
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,364
完成这个想法在哪里
finish this thought where of what's an

230
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:35,764
逆问题通常你就是你
inverse problem typically you you you

231
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,254
知道他们的系统说网络
know about their system say a network

232
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,465
喜欢尝试
like trying to

233
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,575
RLC网络，你给它一个电压或
RLC Network and you give it a voltage or

234
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,545
当前你给它一个输入和你
a current you give it an input and you

235
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,095
找到你发现的输出
find the output you find out what

236
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,145
电流流过电压但是
current flows what the voltages are but

237
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,085
你知道反问题
inverse problems are suppose you know

238
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:07,925
对不同电压的响应是什么
the response to different voltages what

239
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,465
是你看到的网络是什么
were the what was the network you see

240
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,555
问题让我再说一遍
that the problem let me say it again

241
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,145
发现网络的来源
discover what the network is from its

242
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,535
输出通常是结果
outputs so that turns out to typically

243
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,655
是一个几乎奇异的问题
be a problem that gives nearly singular

244
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,835
这是一个困难的矩阵
matrices that's that's a difficult

245
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,985
你附近很多附近的问题
problem you sort of near a lot of nearby

246
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,965
网络实际上也是如此
networks would give virtually the same

247
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,885
输出所以你有一个矩阵
output so so you have a matrix that's

248
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,405
它几乎是奇异的，它具有奇异的价值
nearly singular it's got singular values

249
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,445
非常接近零，你做什么呢
very close to zero what do you do then

250
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,655
以及反问题的世界
well the world of inverse problems

251
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,705
一些加入了惩罚项的认为
thinks of adding a penalty term some

252
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,465
当我最小化的时候，这是一种惩罚
kind of a penalty term when I minimize

253
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,735
这件事本身就是平常的
this thing just by itself in the usual

254
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,775
转置a的方式有一个巨大的反转
way a transpose a has a giant inverse

255
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,645
矩阵a严重受制于它
the matrix a is badly conditioned it

256
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,205
将矢量Verge几乎变为零
takes vectors Verge almost to zero so

257
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,255
转置a是一个巨人
that a transpose a is has got a giant

258
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,165
反过来你就是冒险了
inverse and you're you're at risk of

259
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,795
因为你失去了一切
losing everything to roundoff so you

260
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,245
这是你可以称之为的解决方案
this is the solution you could call it a

261
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,015
一种廉价的解决方案，但它
kind of cheap solution but it's

262
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,195
每个人都使用它，所以我不会这样做
everybody uses it so I won't put that

263
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,735
关于录像带的话，但那就是那种
word on videotape but that that sort of

264
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,775
解决问题，但问题
resolves a problem but then the question

265
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,195
无论如何它转移了一个问题-什么
it it shifts a problem anyway - what

266
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,095
数字应该是什么惩罚如何
number what should be the penalty how

267
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,615
你应该多惩罚它，你会看到它
much should you penalize it you see as

268
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,935
你在购买时添加它
you as you buy adding that

269
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,725
你会让它变得可逆，如果
you're gonna make it invertible and if

270
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,125
你做得越来越大了
you make this bigger and bigger and

271
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,335
更大的是越来越好
bigger it's more and more well

272
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,285
条件它解决了这里的麻烦
conditioned it resolves the trouble here

273
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,775
我就是这样，这是像今天我要去
and I'm so this is like today I'm gonna

274
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,585
做更多的事情让我停下来
do more with that so that I'll stop

275
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,105
还有，说以后把它捡起来
there and pick it up after saying

276
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,115
约6和7的东西
something about 6 & 7

277
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,275
我希望这对你有帮助
I hope this is helpful it was helpful to

278
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,965
我当然要看到这些
me certainly to to see all these

279
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,305
可能性并写下一些
possibilities and to write down sort of

280
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,245
你的症状是什么，就像一个
what you what the symptom is it's like a

281
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,055
医生等的线性方程医生
doctor like a linear equation doctor

282
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,335
就像你寻找症状然后
like you look for the symptoms and then

283
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,825
你在CVS提出了一些建议
you propose some some something at CVS

284
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,715
这有效或无效，但你做到了
that works or it doesn't work but you do

285
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,895
一些事情好了，所以当
something about it okay so so when the

286
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,895
问题太大所以到现在为止
problem is too big so up to now the

287
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,385
问题并没有成为巨大的问题
problems have not been giant out of

288
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,775
当然是这样，但现在它太大了
course it's so but now when it's too big

289
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,694
好吧也许它仍然在Corbett
well maybe it's still in Corbett really

290
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:14,684
大，然后这是2.1所以这是
big then this is in 2.1 so that's to

291
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,885
回到我能说的话
come back to the word I could have

292
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,775
写在这里如果我要去
written in here if I was just gonna

293
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,204
写一个字就是互动
write one word would be interation

294
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,835
迭代方法意味着你拿一个
iterative methods meaning you take a

295
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,555
像共轭梯度法一样的步骤
step like well conjugate gradient method

296
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,155
是迭代方法的英雄
is the is the hero of iterative methods

297
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,735
然后那里我参加比赛的名字就是
and then there that name I raced is

298
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,015
克里洛夫还有其他名字
Krylov and there are other names

299
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,195
与迭代方法相关联
associated with iterative methods so

300
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,065
这是我们通过的部分
that's the section that we passed over

301
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,995
只是为了滚动，但我们会来
just just to get rolling but we'll come

302
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,365
回到那么那个你永远不会
back to so then that that one you never

303
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,305
得到确切的答案，但你越来越近了
get the exact answer but you get closer

304
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,255
更接近
and closer

305
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,174
如果迭代方法成功
if the iterative method is successful

306
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:07,395
就像你得到的共轭梯度一样
like conjugate gradients you get

307
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,304
非常接近很快，然后你
pretty close pretty fast and then you

308
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:11,804
说好的我会接受的
say okay I'll take it

309
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:18,675
然后最后太大了就像没有
and then finally way too big like no

310
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,755
我们不是在核心只是你的矩阵你
we're not in core just your matrix you

311
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,245
只是有一个巨巨问题，其中
just have a giant giant problem which of

312
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,905
当然，正在发生的这些天，然后
course is happening these days and then

313
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,835
一种方法是你我的矩阵
one way to do it is your matrix you I

314
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,235
意思是你，你甚至可以不看的
mean you you can't even look at the

315
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,054
矩阵不是一个转置a
matrix a much less a transpose a

316
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,125
转置一个就像是不可想象的
transpose a would be like unthinkable

317
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,285
你不能在a中做到这一点
you couldn't do it in in the in the in a

318
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,445
年随机线性代数有
year so randomized linear algebra has

319
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,895
突然出现了那个想法
popped up and that the idea there which

320
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:00,795
将看到是使用概率进行抽样
will see is to use probability to sample

321
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:09,065
矩阵并与您的样品一起使用
the matrix and work with your samples so

322
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,485
如果矩阵是合理的，它不是
if the matrix is reasonably it is not is

323
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,795
太大了但不太疯狂所以
too way too big but not too crazy so to

324
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,515
那么你可以对列进行采样
speak then you could sample the columns

325
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,804
和行，并得到一个答案
and the rows and get a an answer from

326
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:31,275
样本看我是否对列进行采样
the sample see if I sample the columns

327
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,585
矩阵的我得到这样的东西
of a matrix I'm getting something so

328
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,735
说什么是抽样意味着让我公正
said what is sampling mean let me just

329
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,375
完成这个说再添加一点
complete this say say add add a little

330
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,255
对于这个矩阵样本，我有一个
to this sample of matrix so I have a

331
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,635
当然，巨型矩阵可能很稀疏
giant matrix a might be sparse of course

332
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,945
我没有分辨那里稀疏
I didn't distinguish over there sparse

333
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,915
事情会是另一件事，如果
things that would be another thing so if

334
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:59,115
我只是随机X随机X的更多
I just take a random X random X's more

335
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,455
比一个但不是完整的n维度
than one but not the full n dimensions

336
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,765
那些会给我随机的人
those will give me random guys in the

337
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,715
列空间和矩阵是否合适
column space and if the matrix is kind

338
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,525
合理的那些会给我它
of reasonable those will give me it

339
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,325
一个漂亮的人不会花太多钱
won't take too many to have a pretty

340
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,105
合理的我
reasonable I

341
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,405
列空间是什么样的
of what that column space is like and

342
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,835
以及它的右侧所以这样
and with its right-hand side so so this

343
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,785
随机线性代数的世界有
world of randomized linear algebra has

344
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,305
成长，因为它必须当然
grown because it had to and of course

345
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,325
你任何声明，它永远不会说
you any statement it can never say for

346
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,215
确定你会得到正确的答案
sure you're gonna get the right answer

347
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,705
但是，但是使用不等式
but but but so using the inequalities of

348
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,975
你可以经常这么说的概率
probability you can often say that

349
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,195
你有机会离开了
you're the chance of being way off is

350
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,735
你知道不到二分之一到二十分之一
you know less than one in two to the 20s

351
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,165
或类似的东西，所以答案是
or something so so the answer is in

352
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,075
现实你得到的是你得到的好
reality you you get that you get a good

353
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,885
回答没问题，就像结束了这一点
answer okay that is like the end of this

354
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,125
第二章第四点所以在这里，这是
chapter two point four so here this is

355
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:14,085
所有第二章都是迭代的
all chapter two really the the iterative

356
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,475
方法一所有极本
methods in to one all that most of this

357
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,475
在两点两大是两点
is in two point two big is two point

358
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,955
三，然后真的很大是随机的
three and then really big is randomized

359
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,615
在两点四好，所以现在在哪里
in two point four okay so now where are

360
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,835
我们
we

361
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,335
如果你要告诉我或不知道
you're going to let me know or not if

362
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,655
这对C很有用，但你有点儿
this is useful the C but you're sort of

363
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,315
你有点看到现实生活中的东西
you sort of see what what are real-life

364
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,465
问题，当然我们是高度的
problems and of course we're highly

365
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,555
在获得该特别感兴趣
especially interested in getting to the

366
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,015
深入学习的例子
deep learning examples which are

367
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,345
不确定是的，那么当你的时候
underdetermined yeah then when you're

368
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,505
在确定你已经得到了很多
under determined you've got many

369
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,445
解决方案和问题是哪一个
solutions and the question is which one

370
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,665
是一个很好的，并深入学习我
is a good one and in deep learning I

371
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,155
只是我无法抗拒说一句话
just I can't resist saying another word

372
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,005
你希望有很多解决方案
you hope so there are many solutions

373
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,975
如何做好你的选择一些
what to do well your your pick some

374
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,445
像最速下降的算法
algorithm like steepest descent which is

375
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,535
找到一个解决方案让你如愿
going to find a solution so you're like

376
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,865
你希望它是一个好的，什么是一个
you hope it's a good one and what is a

377
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,025
好的意思是经文不好
good one mean verses are not good one

378
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,535
他们都是解决方案的好方法
they're all solutions a good one means

379
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,845
当你将它应用于测试时
that when you apply it to the test

380
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,965
你还没有看到的数据
data that you haven't yet seen it gives

381
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,185
对您的测试数据有良好的效果
good results on the test data you've

382
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,705
确实解决方案已经学会了
really the solution has learned

383
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,255
来自训练数据的东西和它
something from the training data and it

384
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,525
处理测试数据，这就是
works on the test data so that's the the

385
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,005
在深度学习如何大问题
the big question in deep learning how

386
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,345
你这样做是否真的发生了？
does it happen that you by doing

387
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,455
梯度下降或任何算法
gradient descent or whatever algorithm

388
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,305
该算法如何偏向于
how does that algorithm sort of bias the

389
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,785
解决方案它被称为隐式偏见如何
solution it's called implicit bias how

390
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,155
该算法是否偏向于解决方案
does that algorithm bias a solution

391
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,695
朝着一个解决方案的方向发展
toward one toward a solution that's that

392
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,535
推广适用于测试数据和
generalizes that works on test data and

393
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,275
你可以想到哪些算法会
you can think of algorithms which would

394
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,855
让它接近一个没有的解决方案
give it approach a solution that did not

395
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,455
处理测试数据，这就是你
work on test data so that's what you

396
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,195
想要远离你想要的那些
want to stay away from you want the ones

397
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,445
那工作所以有非常深刻的数学
that work so there's very deep math

398
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,315
问题有其惟一知道
questions there which are kind of knew

399
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,505
他们并没有出现，直到他们没有和
they didn't arise until they did and

400
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,075
会尽量节省一些什么什么
will try to save some of what's what's

401
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,485
被理解为好，我现在可以关注
being understood okay can I focus now on

402
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,915
对于剩下今天在这休息
for the rest the rest of today on this

403
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,165
矩阵几乎是单数的情况
case when the matrix is nearly singular

404
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,225
所以你可以应用消除但它
so you could apply elimination but it

405
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,935
会产生糟糕的结果，但那么
would give a poor result but so the then

406
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,655
一种解决方案是好耶
one solution is well yeah

407
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,405
一个解决方案是我提到的SVD
one solution is the SVD I only mentioned

408
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,625
这里的SVD作为一个算法，但
the SVD here as an algorithm but of

409
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,685
当然这是SVD会给你的
course it is the SVD would give you

410
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,955
给你一个答案的男孩在哪里
gives you gives you an answer boy where

411
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,805
如果这已经过得很好了
should that have gone well space over

412
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:31,995
这里的SVD让你产生
here the SVD so that produces you you

413
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,695
有一个相同的西格玛V转置和
have a equal u Sigma V transpose and

414
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,405
那么逆是VSigma逆u
then a inverse is V Sigma inverse u

415
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:45,785
转置没关系
transpose okay

416
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,645
所以我们在这里谈论我们
so we're in the case here we're talking

417
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,855
关于五号几乎奇异的地方
about number five nearly singular where

418
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,975
西格玛有一些非常小的单数
Sigma has some very small singular

419
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,515
价值然后Sigma反转有一些非常
values then Sigma inverse has some very

420
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,174
大的奇异值，所以这就是你
big singular values so this is you're

421
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,125
真的是野生的狂野领地
really in kind of wild wild territory

422
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,235
这里有非常大的反转所以
here with with very big inverses so that

423
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,155
这会是一种方法，但是
would that would be one way to do it but

424
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,665
这是一种规范化的方法
this is a this is a way to regularize

425
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,505
这个问题让我们注意一下
the problem so let's just pay attention

426
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:31,835
到还好还好所以我想尽量减少
to that okay okay so suppose I minimize

427
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,795
斧头减去B平方和Delta的总和
the sum of ax minus B squared and Delta

428
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,755
平方乘以x平方的大小
squared times the size of x squared and

429
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,605
我将使用L2标准是会
I'm going to use the l2 norm it's gonna

430
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,185
至少是一个花生
be at least squares a peanut least

431
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,245
有惩罚的广场当然是这样的
squares with penalty so of course it's

432
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:55,755
这里的l2规范-是的，好吧，我想
the l2 norm here - yep okay suppose I

433
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,415
为我选择的一些人解决这个问题
solve that for a delta for some I choose

434
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,405
我必须选择一个积极的三角洲
I have to choose a delta a positive

435
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,935
三角洲和我选择积极的三角洲
Delta and when I choose a positive Delta

436
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,315
然后我有一个可解决的问题
then I have a solvable problem

437
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,005
即使这变为零或一个
even if this goes to zero or a does

438
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:21,465
疯狂的事情这会让我感到高兴
crazy things this is going to keep me

439
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,095
实际上远离单数的方程式
away from singular in fact what equation

440
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,515
这会导致这是至少
does that lead to so that's a least

441
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,395
正方形问题，额外罚款
squares problem with an extra penalty

442
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,025
因为它会来，我想是的
term so it would come I suppose let's

443
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:43,205
看看我是否将方程写为deltaIx
see if I write the equations a delta I x

444
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:50,025
等于B0可能是最少的
equals B 0 maybe that is the least

445
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,015
平方方程式通常正常
squares equation the usual normal

446
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,105
对此的等式
equation for this

447
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,655
增强系统，因为有什么
augmented system because what's the

448
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,195
错误在这里这是一个新的大aa明星
error here this is the new big a a star

449
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:13,825
让我们说X等于这是新的B所以
let's say X equals this is the new B so

450
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,475
如果我应用最小二乘法来做什么
if I apply least-squares to that what do

451
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,804
我尽量减少方格和我的总和
I do I minimize the sum of squares and I

452
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,575
所以我最不正常
so I'm in so least squares would

453
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,695
最小化ax减去B平方即可
minimize ax minus B squared that would

454
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,955
是来自第一个组件和
be the from the first components and

455
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,355
Delta从最后一个平方x平方
Delta squared x squared from the last

456
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,174
组件正是我们所说的
component which is exactly what we said

457
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,495
我们这样做的方式是这样的
we were doing so in a way this is the

458
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,195
看到那个惩罚的等式
equation that saw that the penalty

459
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,545
方法正在解决，问题是如此
method is solving and the question is so

460
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,515
一个问题很自然就是看什么
one question natural is watch what's

461
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,935
你的DeltaB那就是那个问题
your Delta B well that's that questions

462
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,075
今天超越我们，这是一个平衡
beyond us today that it's it's a balance

463
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,345
你怎么相信和多少
of how what you can believe and how much

464
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,215
噪音在系统和一切
noise is in the system and everything

465
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,815
我们可以问的是Delta的选择
yeah choice of Delta what we could ask

466
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,645
是数学问题会发生什么
is the math question what happens as

467
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,935
Delta变为0所以假设我解决了这个问题
Delta goes to 0 so suppose I solve this

468
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,855
问题让我看看我能写出来
problem let's see I could write it

469
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,105
不同，我会在那里写什么
differently shall I write there what

470
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,915
这部分就是这里的等式
would be the equation here this part

471
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,245
会给我们a转置a然后
would give us the a transpose a and then

472
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,605
这部分会给我们带来的
this part would give us just the

473
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:44,485
身份x等于转置BI思考
identity x equals a transpose B I think

474
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,295
是的，那不是我真的
yeah wouldn't that be so really I've

475
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,325
这里写的是一个明星
written here what that is is a star

476
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,235
转移这是最不明智的明星
transpose a star that this is least

477
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,715
在这个广场给它给出了
squares on this gives it gives that

478
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,235
因此所有这些都是等价的
equation so all of those are equivalent

479
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,765
所有这些都是等价的
all of those would be equivalent

480
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,615
陈述什么惩罚问题
statements of what the penalized problem

481
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,345
是你在解决，然后是
is that you're solving and then the

482
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,065
问题是Delta达到了什么
question is as Delta goes to 0 what

483
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,985
当然发生在你什么时候
happens of course something you're when

484
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,804
Delta达到0你就是在堕落
Delta goes to 0 you're you're falling

485
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:24,775
在悬崖上有点东西
off the cliff something something quite

486
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,245
不同它突然发生了
different it's suddenly going to happen

487
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,174
也许我们甚至可以理解
there maybe we could even understand

488
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:35,085
这个问题有一个1比1的矩阵
this this question with a 1 by 1 matrix

489
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,695
是的我觉得这部分以a开头
yeah I think this section starts with a

490
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,304
1比1假设a只是一个数字没关系
1 by 1 suppose a is just a number okay

491
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:46,375
也许我会把它放在这个板上
maybe I'll just put that on this board

492
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:52,914
这里假设a只是一个数字那么
here suppose a is just a number so what

493
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,865
我该怎么拨打该号码时只需一
am I gonna call that number just one by

494
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,685
让我称之为Sigma，因为它是
one let me call it Sigma because it's

495
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,975
当然是领先的奇异价值
certainly the leading singular value

496
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:08,035
好吧那么我的等式是什么
okay so so what's my equation that I'm

497
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,725
解决转置问题将是西格玛
solving a transpose a would be Sigma

498
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:17,505
广场加三角洲广场一个接一个X.
square plus Delta square one by one X

499
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,635
我应该给一些标在这里我
should I give some subscript here I

500
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,535
应该真的这样做是对的
should really to do it right this is the

501
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:30,295
给定Delta和我的解决方案
solution for a given Delta and I'm

502
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,905
询问发生了什么，以便解决
asking what happened so that solution

503
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,545
这个矩阵肯定会存在
will exist fine this matrix is certainly

504
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,605
可逆的是半正定的
invertible that's positive semi definite

505
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,905
至少那是积极的半明确的
at least that's positive semi definite

506
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,804
那么delta的平方怎么样呢
and what about delta squared i it is

507
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:49,465
正定当然只是
positive definite of course just the

508
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,215
与一个因素的身份所以这是一个
identity with a factor so this is a

509
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,405
正定矩阵它在那里我
positive definite matrix it's there i

510
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,164
当然有一个解决方案，让我
certainly have a solution and let me

511
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:01,495
继续这个逐个案例
keep going on this one by one case this

512
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,435
将是一个转移a只是一个西格玛我
would be a transfer a is just a sigma i

513
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,265
认为这只是sigmapokay所以这是
think it's just sigma p okay so this is

514
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,335
a是一个接一个，有两个案例
a is one by one and there are two cases

515
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,255
这里西格玛大于零或西格玛
here sigma bigger than zero or sigma

516
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,365
等于零
equals zero

517
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,325
在任何一种情况下，我只是想
and in either case we I just want to

518
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,735
知道什么是限制所以答案X
know what's the limit so so the answer X

519
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,595
是啊，让我再右手
yeah let me just take the right hand

520
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,165
侧
side

521
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:40,155
不，那很好，所以我也好
no that's fine yep okay so am i

522
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,005
竞争好吧使用惩罚
competing okay the using the penalized

523
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,215
关于你一个接一个问题的事情
thing on a one by one problem which you

524
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,885
可以说是那种有点小
could say is kind of a little bit small

525
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:56,985
为了解决这个等式或
for so solving this equation or

526
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,475
等价地减少这个，所以我就是我
equivalently minimizing this so I'm I'm

527
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:08,155
在这里，我发现了最低限度
here I'm finding the minimum of a was

528
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,655
SigmaX减去B平方加Delta
Sigma X minus B squared plus Delta

529
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,345
平方x平方我是因为我希望
squared x squared I'm because I'm hoping

530
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,405
如果我发现你看到它只是
that if I found that you see it's just

531
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,255
一个接一个只是一个数字，我希望
one by one just a number and I'm hoping

532
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,415
如果计算微积分会同意
that if calculate calculus will agree

533
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,935
这里有线性代数，如果我找到的话
with linear algebra here that if I find

534
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,905
这个的最小值让我写下来
the minimum of this so let me write it

535
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,745
Sigma平方x平方和Delta
out Sigma squared x squared and Delta

536
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,845
平方x平方然后减去2西格玛
squared x squared and then minus 2 Sigma

537
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:43,285
XB然后加B平方，现在我
X B and then plus B squared and now I'm

538
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,925
要找到最小的意思
going to find the minimum which means

539
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,165
我将导数设置为0，所以得到2
I'd set the derivative to 0 so I get 2

540
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,625
Sigma得到了平方，我获得了2个Delta平方
Sigma squared and 2 Delta squared I get

541
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,065
a2在这里，这给了我X.
a 2 here and this gives me the X

542
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,555
衍生物是2西格玛B，所以我得到2
derivative is 2 Sigma B so I get a 2

543
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,465
在那里，我很好，我刚刚取消了两个
there and I'm ok I just cancelled both

544
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,625
两个，这就是我的等式
the twos and that's the equation so I

545
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:12,175
可以解决方程X是SigmaB
can solve that equation X is Sigma B

546
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,835
西格玛超过Sigma平方加上Delta
Sigma over Sigma squared plus Delta

547
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,615
平方B所以这真的是我的数量
squared B so it's really that quantity I

548
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:29,815
想让Delta再次走到0那么
want to let Delta go to 0 so again what

549
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,935
我在这里干什么我走我一个1×1
am I doing here I'm taking a 1 by 1

550
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,875
例子只是为了看看会发生什么
example just to see what happens in the

551
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,845
限制
limit

552
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:41,995
作为sigma-delta对不起Delta达到0
as sigma-delta sorry Delta goes to 0

553
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,745
发生了什么，所以我只需要看看
what happens so I just have to look at

554
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,825
这个东西的限制是什么？
that what is the limit of that thing in

555
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:55,295
当Delta达到0时就是一个圆圈
a circle as Delta goes to 0 that's so

556
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,695
我发现了一个接一个的问题
I'm finding out for a one by one problem

557
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,655
什么是惩罚最小二乘问题
what a penalized least squares problem

558
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,925
岭回归可能遍布整个世界
Ridge regression could all over the

559
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,645
把发生的事情确定，所以会发生什么
place what happens ok so what happens to

560
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:15,845
这个数字随着Delta变为01而过
that number as Delta goes to 0 1 over

561
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:21,815
西格玛所以现在三角洲变为0所以
Sigma so now the Delta go to 0 so that

562
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,385
因为，超过Sigma的方法是1
approaches 1 over Sigma right because

563
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:28,055
Delta消失，Sigma超过Sigma
Delta disappears and Sigma over Sigma

564
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,155
平均1超过Sigma，所以它接近
squared 1 over Sigma so it approaches

565
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,805
相反，但另一个是什么
the inverse but but what's the other

566
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,195
可能性在这里另一种可能性
possibility here the other possibility

567
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,635
西格玛是0
is that Sigma is 0

568
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,865
我没有说这个矩阵是否是1
I didn't say whether this matrix is 1 by

569
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,465
如果Sigma，1个矩阵是否可逆
1 matrix was invertible or not if Sigma

570
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:53,495
不是0然后我在Sigma上1到1
is not 0 then I go to 1 over Sigma if

571
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,695
Sigma非常小，需要一段时间
Sigma is really small it'll take a while

572
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,735
达美必须要小一点
Delta will have to get small small small

573
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,435
甚至与Sigma相比直到
even compared to Sigma until till

574
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,745
最后这个词就消失了，我只是
finally that term goes away and I'm just

575
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,575
有一个超过西格玛，但如果西格玛是0
have 1 over Sigma but what if Sigma is 0

576
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,675
对不起感到兴奋0谁也
sorry to get excited about 0 who would

577
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,585
兴奋的0好，所以这就是
get excited about 0 ok so this is the

578
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,725
如果西格玛是西格玛，则为1
case when this is 1 over Sigma if Sigma

579
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,335
是积极的，如果，它会接近什么
is positive and what does it approach if

580
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:31,415
Sigma为00因为它会为0
Sigma is 0 0 because this is 0 it will

581
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,025
整个问题就像消失了
the whole problem was like disappeared

582
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:39,725
这里西格玛是0这里是西格玛所以
here the Sigma was 0 here's a Sigma so

583
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,955
无论如何
anyway

584
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,045
西格玛将是西格玛是0而我是
Sigma will be if Sigma is 0 and I'm

585
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,785
总是0，但我有一个
getting 0 all the time but I have a

586
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,255
体面的问题，因为德尔
decent problem because the del

587
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,475
-平方在那里我有一个体面的
- squared is there I have a decent

588
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,395
问题直到最后一刻我的问题
problem until the last minute my problem

589
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,525
分崩离析Delta变为0，我有一个
falls apart Delta goes to 0 and I have a

590
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,555
零等于零问题我迷失了但是
zero equals zero problem I'm lost but

591
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,555
关键是惩罚让我保持
the point is the penalty kept me

592
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,435
积极让我保持这个三角洲的平方
positive kept me with this Delta squared

593
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,655
直到最后一个关键时刻为止
term until the last critical moment even

594
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,845
即使那样，它也让我保持积极的态度
it kept me positive even if that was

595
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,135
零如果为零，则为零
zero if that is zero and this is zero I

596
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,864
还有什么东西在这里，所以我还是
still have something here so I still

597
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:22,775
有问题需要解决，有什么问题
have a problem to solve and what's the

598
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,635
如果西格玛是，则限制为1
limit then so a 1 over Sigma if Sigma is

599
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,385
积极的，如果西格玛，答案是什么？
positive and what's the answer if Sigma

600
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,364
不是肯定的，只是告诉我它是0
is not positive it's 0 just tell me it's

601
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:39,185
再次，我得到0，我得到0全部
again I'm getting 0 well I get 0 all the

602
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:49,835
方式，我在限制中得到0，现在让
way and I get 0 in the limit and now let

603
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,675
我只想问我在这里得到了什么
me just ask what have I got here what

604
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,575
这突如其来的分叉是什么？
what is this this sudden bifurcation

605
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,935
这才是我认识到的
that's what's the do I recognize this

606
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,135
限制中的倒数为Delta
the the inverse in the limit as Delta

607
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,455
如果是，那么转到0对于Sigma是1
goes to 0 is either 1 over Sigma if it's

608
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,595
如果这是有道理的
if that makes sense

609
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,925
或0表示不超过1段
or at 0 which is not like 1 over segment

610
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,625
Sigma超过Sigma1，而Sigma则为0
1 over Sigma as Sigma goes to 0 the

611
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,005
事这件事情变得越来越大，
thing this thing is getting bigger and

612
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,455
大
bigger

613
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,925
但在西格玛等于0的0你看
but at Sigma equals 0 its 0 you see

614
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,765
这真的是一种奇怪的
that's a really that's a strange kind of

615
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,175
一个极限，现在是什么词
a limit and what word now it would be

616
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,245
我在这里找到了什么
over there what have I found here in

617
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,665
这个限制你说再说一遍，因为
this limit you say say it again because

618
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,104
这是完全正确的有
it was exactly right there's

619
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:46,375
伪逆所以这个这个系统
pseudo-inverse so this this this system

620
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,345
选择大于零的Delta然后
choose Delta greater than zero then

621
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,555
三角洲要去0解决方案去
Delta are going to 0 the solution goes

622
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,515
到伪逆
to the pseudo-inverse

623
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,405
这就是关键时刻
that's the key fact that that is when

624
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,515
达美实在是真的很小
Delta is really really small then this

625
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,745
如果达美，那就表现得非常疯狂
behaves in a pretty crazy way if Delta

626
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,385
真的很小，然后
is really really small then and then

627
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,555
如果是Sigma，Sigma会更大或者它是零
Sigma is bigger or it's zero if it's

628
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,925
如果它是零，那你走的就越大
bigger you go this way if it's zero you

629
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:30,064
走那条路就是这就是消息
go that way so that's that's the message

630
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:39,395
而且这还有的惩罚这些
and that this there's penalized these

631
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,104
随着惩罚的到来，方块接近
squares approaches as the penalty gets

632
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:46,205
越来越小的接近
smaller and smaller approaches the

633
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,415
正确回答总是正确的答案
correct answer the always correct answer

634
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,715
零和之间的分裂突然
with that sudden split between zero and

635
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,594
不是我们与之相关的零
not zero that we associate with the

636
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,695
伪逆当然是一个
pseudo-inverse yeah of course in a

637
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,455
你试图找到的实际案例
practical case you're trying to find the

638
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,854
a中的电阻和电感
the resistances and inductances in a

639
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:13,854
通过尝试电路和电路
circuit by trying the circuit and

640
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:17,104
看着输出B并搞清楚
looking at the output B and figuring out

641
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:22,265
什么输入什么是如此未知
what input what what the so the unknown

642
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,104
X是未知系统
X is the is the unknown system

643
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:29,465
参数电压而不是
parameters the voltage and not the

644
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,564
电压和电流，但但
voltage and current but the but the

645
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,875
电阻和电感
resistance and inductance and

646
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:42,905
电容好，所以现在我只有
capacitance okay so that's now I've only

647
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,265
事实证明，你在一个接一个的情况下
proved that in the one by one case you

648
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,955
可能会说这不是一个证据
may say that's not much of a proof in

649
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,165
我们可以一个接一个地看到它
the one by one case we could see it

650
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,945
发生在我们眼前
happen in front of our eyes

651
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:01,895
所以真的一步我没有带到这里
so really step I haven't taken here is

652
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,415
完成任何矩阵a
to complete that to any matrix a so

653
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,445
这就是声明
that's the statement then that's the

654
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:19,614
声明
statement

655
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,195
所以这是任何或任何的陈述
so that's the statement for any or any

656
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,195
矩阵a这个矩阵a转置A加
matrix a this matrix a transpose A plus

657
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,104
Delta平方反转时间为转置
Delta squared inverse times a transpose

658
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:37,145
这是我们的解决方案矩阵
that's the solution matrix to our

659
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,254
问题是的，这就是我写的
problem right yep that's what I wrote

660
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:44,195
在那里我采取反向和弹出
down up there I take the inverse and pop

661
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:52,895
它在那里接近加号
it over there that approaches a plus the

662
00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:00,395
伪逆，这就是我们刚刚
pseudo inverse and that's what we just

663
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,324
逐个检查这一点
checked for one by one one by one this

664
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,955
西格玛超过Sigma平方加上Delta
was Sigma over Sigma squared plus Delta

665
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,665
平方，它到了1结束
squared and it went to either to 1 over

666
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,375
西格玛或它在0分裂它的限制
Sigma or to 0 it split in the limit it

667
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,685
表明限制是微妙的
shows that limits are can be delicate

668
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,685
你知道Delta达到0时的极限
you know the limit as Delta goes to 0

669
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,935
这件事突然间断了
this thing it suddenly discontinuous

670
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,574
这是它那这个号码
it's it's it's this number that's

671
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:34,114
成长，然后突然在0下降
growing and then suddenly at 0 it falls

672
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,935
无论如何，回到0将是
back to 0 anyway that would be the

673
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,905
声明实际上是统计学家
statement actually statisticians

674
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,574
发现了伪逆像
discovered the pseudo inverse like

675
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:48,514
独立于线性代数历史
independently of linear algebra history

676
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:52,625
这是因为统计学家确实做到了
of it because statisticians did exactly

677
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,705
那要规范他们的问题
that to regularize the problem they

678
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,314
介绍了一个惩罚并与之合作
introduced a penalty and worked with

679
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:03,635
这个矩阵所以统计学家就是这样的
this matrix so so statisticians were the

680
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,044
首先要看到，是的想到
first to see that that yeah to think of

681
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:11,435
这是一个很自然的事情
that as a natural thing to do in in a

682
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,695
罚款的实际案例好吧所以我
practical case at a penalty okay so I

683
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,564
猜这是增加一个惩罚但是
guess so this is adding a penalty but

684
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:25,305
记住，我们留下了L两个规范
remember that we stayed with L two norms

685
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:38,505
我们可以保持l2最小二乘
staying with l2 least-squares we could

686
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,875
问问发生了什么
ask what happens yeah

687
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,685
假设罚款是l1标准
suppose the penalty is the l1 norm

688
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,215
假设我最小化我不能做到这一点
suppose I minimize I'm not up to do this

689
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,105
今天
today

690
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,715
假设我最小化，也许让我们说
suppose I minimize that maybe let's say

691
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,295
我会做l2，但我会做点球员
I'll do l2 but I'll do the penalty guy

692
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:08,105
在l1规范中，我猜我不是，我是
in the l1 norm I guess I'm not yeah I'm

693
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,565
当然不是那个或你的专家
certainly not an expert on that or you

694
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,495
甚至可以认为这样的力量
could even think just that power so that

695
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,735
会有一个统计学家的名字
would have a name that statisticians a

696
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,065
统计学家发明了它的名字
statistician invented this it's called

697
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,715
在l1规范中的套索，这是一个很大的
the lasso in the l1 norm and it's a big

698
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,005
处理像l1规范那样的雪决定
deal snow decisions like the l1 norm

699
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:36,585
因为它真的因为它
because because it really because it

700
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:39,015
给出了给你的稀疏解决方案
gives sparse solutions it gives you give

701
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,175
没有一个更真实的解决方案
sort of more genuine solutions without a

702
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,085
一大堆在一点一点的组件
whole lot of little little components in

703
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,115
答案是的，所以这是一个
the answer yep so that this was an

704
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:53,175
重要的一步，所以也许让我只是
important step and so maybe let me just

705
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,355
再说一遍，我们就是那么大的地方
say again we're where we are in that big

706
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:01,875
列出两个重要的
list the the the the two important ones

707
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,385
我没有做过但这些都是
that I haven't done yet are these

708
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,145
2.1中的迭代方法就是这样的
iterative methods in 2.1 so that's like

709
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,095
传统的线性代数就是如何
conventional linear algebra just how to

710
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,245
处理一个大矩阵可能与一些
deal with a big matrix maybe with some

711
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,315
特殊结构是线性的
special structure that's what linear

712
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,355
代数是数值线性代数
algebra is numerical linear algebra is

713
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,725
所有关于然后克-施密特与或
all about and then gram-schmidt with or

714
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,505
没有旋转，这是一个主力
without pivoting which is a workhorse of

715
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,075
数值计算，我想我
of numerical computing and I think I

716
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,745
最好保存下次
better save that for next time

717
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,605
所以这就是那个
so so this is the one

718
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:45,715
在这个时候挑选，我们看到了什么
picked for this time and we saw what

719
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,385
发生在l2井，我们看到了一个
happened in l2 well we saw it for one by

720
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,305
你想扩展一个证明吗？
one would you want to extend to prove

721
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:59,235
这对于任何超越一个一个
this for any a going beyond one by one

722
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,965
你怎么会为任何人证明这样的事情
how would you prove such a thing for any

723
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:09,825
我想我不会这样做的
a I guess I'm I'm not going to do it it

724
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:15,175
这太痛苦但是你怎么样？
it's too painful but but how would you

725
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:20,815
如果你愿意，你可以使用SVD
do it you would use the SVD if you want

726
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,575
证明关于矩阵的一些东西
to prove something about matrices about

727
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,315
任何矩阵SVD都是你最好的东西
any matrix the SVD is the best thing you

728
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,055
可以拥有你可以拥有的最好的工具
could have the best tool you could have

729
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,605
我可以用SVDI来写这个
I can write this in terms of the SVD I

730
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,625
只需插入即可插入等号
just plug in I just plug in a equals

731
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,455
无论SVD告诉我什么
whatever the SVD tells me to put in

732
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,095
在那里你使用SigmaVtranspose插入它
there you Sigma V transpose plug it in

733
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,815
使用这个事实简化了它
there simplify it using the fact that

734
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,385
这些是正交的你知道我总是
these are orthogonal you know I always

735
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,115
如果我有任何好运，我会得到的
if I have any good luck it'll I'll get

736
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,455
从那里到某个地方的身份
an identity somewhere from there and an

737
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,975
从那里到某个地方的身份
identity somewhere from there and it'll

738
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,625
所有简化它都将对角化
all simplify it'll all diagonalize

739
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,545
这就是在SVD确实这
that's what the SVD really does this

740
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,935
把我凌乱的问题变成一个问题
turns my messy problem into a problem

741
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,515
关于他们的对角矩阵西格玛
about their diagonal matrix Sigma in the

742
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,945
中间所以我不妨把西格玛放进去
middle so I might as well put Sigma in

743
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,735
中间是的，为什么不在我们给予之前
the middle yeah why not before we give

744
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,515
在它上面
up on it

745
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,094
一个特例，但真的
a special case of that but the really

746
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:33,285
真实的情况就是a
the genuine case would be when a is

747
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:38,175
SigmaSigma转换Sigma加Delta
Sigma Sigma transpose Sigma plus Delta

748
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,844
平方i反转时间Sigma转置
squared i inverse times Sigma transpose

749
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:48,705
接近伪逆Sigma加
approaches the pseudo inverse Sigma plus

750
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,824
而这一点就是矩阵西格玛
and the point is the matrix Sigma here

751
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:57,165
是对角线哦，我几乎在那里
is diagonal and oh I'm practically there

752
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:03,915
实际上为什么我接近于存在
actually why am i close to being being

753
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,035
能够很好地阅读这一切
able to read this off well everything is

754
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,314
对角线对角线对角线
diagonal here diagonal diagonal diagonal

755
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:15,705
以及那些对角线上发生了什么
and what's happening on those diagonal

756
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:22,035
条目，所以你不得不接受我的话
entries so you had to take my word that

757
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,235
当我插入SVD的U和
when I plugged in the SVD the U and the

758
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,385
V有点被分开了
V kind of got got separated out to the

759
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,635
最左边和最右边，它是
far left and the far right and it was

760
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,225
这是住在中部所以它的
that that stayed in the middle so it's

761
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:43,094
真的，这是它的核心和方式
really this is the heart of it and how

762
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,895
你认为这是一个对角线吗？
do you suppose so that's a diagonal

763
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,255
矩阵所以我只是看看会发生什么
matrix so I'm just looking what happens

764
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,025
在每个对角线入口和哪个问题
on each diagonal entry and which problem

765
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,745
这是什么问题
is that well the the question of what's

766
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,535
发生在一个典型的对角线入口
happening on a typical diagonal entry of

767
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:05,175
这件事是什么问题的
this thing is is what question the

768
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,554
一个接一个的案子现在一个接一个，因为
one-by-one case now one by one because

769
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:12,885
对角线中的每个条目都不均匀
each entry in the diagonal is not even

770
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,275
注意到其他人是的，所以那就是
noticing the others yeah so so that's

771
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,145
逻辑，它将在笔记中
the logic and it would be in the notes

772
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,145
首先逐一证明它
prove it first for one by one and

773
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:29,175
其次是对角线，最后是对角线
secondly for diagonal this and finally

774
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,314
对于A和他们正在使用SVD
for with A's and they're using the SVD

775
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:36,735
和你一起被转换成两个来获得
with you and be transposed to two to get

776
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,114
走开，带我们回到这里
out of the way and bring us back to here

777
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,294
好吧这是理论，但真的是II
okay so that's the theory but really I I

778
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:47,784
我想我的想法最多
guess I'm thinking that far the most

779
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:51,415
今天的重要信息
important thing message in today's

780
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:57,445
讲座在这个不同的列表中
lecture is in this list of different

781
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,284
出现的问题类型和
types of problems that appear and

782
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:04,165
与他们和我们合作的不同方式
different ways to work with them and we

783
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,714
还没有完成克施密特
haven't done gram-schmidt and that will

784
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:11,054
是的，我们还没有这样做
be and we haven't done it eration so

785
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:14,094
这是我作为一个这一章
this is I'm kind of this chapter as a

786
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:17,514
比的调查以及更多的调查
survey of well more than a survey of

787
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,544
什么数值线性代数是关于
what numerical linear algebra is about

788
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:22,584
而且我还没有做过随机而我很抱歉
and I haven't done random yet I'm sorry

789
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:28,284
这是未来-所以三块是
that's coming - so three pieces are

790
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:30,769
still to come but let's take the last

791
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:36,019
还是要来，但让我们拿走最后一个

792
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:36,019
两分钟，并称它为一天
two minutes off and call it a day
