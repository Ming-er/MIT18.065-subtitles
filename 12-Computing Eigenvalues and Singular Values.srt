00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,975
好的，所以我希望我们能拥有
ok so I was hoping that we would have

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,745
准备下一个在线作业但是
the next online assignment ready but

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,105
Julia6新版本正在减缓我们的速度
Julia 6 the new version is slowing us

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:44,075
下来，它可能是下一次但是
down and it'd probably be next time but

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,925
我的讲座当然是我的
my lectures of course are well what I

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,525
想说或许这不是
want to say perhaps is this isn't

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,295
打算成为数学课程
intended to be a course in numerical

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,945
线性代数，但我以为我不能
linear algebra but I thought I couldn't

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,565
让整个学期过去
let the whole whole semester go by

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,574
没有说什么怎么样
without saying something about how to

19
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,395
计算特征值和奇异值
compute eigenvalues and singular values

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,215
当然你会打电话给AG或SVD或
of course you're gonna call AG or SVD or

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,415
它们相当于Python或Julia但是
they equivalent in Python or Julia but

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,265
实际上我们的QR分解
actually the QR factorization that we

23
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,265
谈到我们谈到完全关闭
spoke about that we spoke off entirely

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,364
关于上次是意外的关键
about last time is the key unexpectedly

25
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:36,885
你意外地有一个矩阵a
unexpectedly you have a matrix a whose

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,555
你想要的本征值让我们开始吧
eigen values you want so let's start

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,315
具有特征值，它可能是一个
with eigen values and it might be a

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,245
对称矩阵ii将留在
symmetric matrix i-i'll stay with a

29
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,735
而不是因为它没有
rather than s because it doesn't have to

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,765
是，但你得到特殊的总是你
be but you get special always you get

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,915
如果矩阵是特殊的东西
something special if the matrix is

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,705
对称确定所以这种计算方法
symmetric ok so this method of computing

33
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,555
至少对我来说是特征值，我想
eigen values to me at least and I think

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,105
有太多的人像这样出来了
too many people came like out of the

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,324
前一段时间的蓝色，但不久前
blue a while ago but not that long ago

36
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:14,204
而且效果很好
and it worked very well

37
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:14,985
所以
so

38
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,415
这就是它被称为QR的想法
here's the idea it's called the QR

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,765
方法，因为你从保理开始
method because you start by factoring

40
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,275
你的矩阵进入QR所以这是一个
your matrix into QR so here's a that's

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,145
我们可以称之为零
can we call it a zero

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,575
得到了一些我们从哪个矩阵开始
got some matrix we start with whose

43
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,335
我们想要的特征值，我会称之为
eigenvalues we want and I'll call these

44
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,505
Q0和R0，你还记得那是什么
Q 0 and R 0 and you remember what that

45
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,315
手段
means

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,835
那是什么躲在后面
what that what what's hiding behind

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,715
那些我写的你的信
those letters that I've written you have

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,825
像I一样可能对称的列
the columns of a possibly symmetric as I

49
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:56,015
说但不是正交通常所以你
said but not orthogonal usually so you

50
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,445
找到一个正交的基础
find an orthogonal basis you

51
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,635
将它们正交化它们
orthogonalize them you line them up

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,945
然后彼此垂直
perpendicular to each other and then

53
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,815
有一个矩阵R正好发生
there's a matrix R which is happens to

54
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,975
是连接上部的三角形
be upper triangular that connects the

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,665
与正交不正交
not orthogonal basis with the orthogonal

56
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:23,505
基础权利我们构建了我们的步骤
basis right we we constructed our step

57
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,865
一步一步然后想法是写这些
by step and then the idea is write these

58
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,965
以相反的顺序，这将是一个
in the reverse order and that will be a

59
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:41,865
1在下一个确定，然后再次做到这一点，
1 the next a ok and then do it again and

60
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,855
一次又一次
again and again

61
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,525
所以我们当然希望那个
and so we're hoping of course that the

62
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,635
特征值没有改变，我们希望如此
eigenvalues didn't change we hoping that

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,025
我们可以用1来忘记0再次开始
we can forget a 0 start again with a 1

64
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,045
并产生一个2并继续这样我们
and produce a 2 and continue so we're

65
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,935
希望有两件事不会有希望
hoping two things one will not be hope

66
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,835
我们可以看到特征值
we can see that the eigenvalues the

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,115
1和n的特征值是
eigenvalues of a 1 and a naught are the

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,855
相同的，所以我们并没有改变
same so we have not changed the

69
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,035
特征值如果你，我们怎么看？
eigenvalues how did we see that if you

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,035
不得不表明两个矩阵有
had to show that two matrices had the

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,544
你会计算所有相同的特征值
same eigenvalues would you compute all

72
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,495
特征值并比较他们
the eigenvalues and compare them he'll

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,135
当然不是你会做什么的
certainly not what would you do what's

74
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,754
通常的最佳测试通常的测试
the best test the usual test the usual

75
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,284
你想的东西展现给他们
thing you would want to show to they're

76
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:33,765
类似
similar

77
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,985
这是正确的，所以声称就是这样
that's right so the claim would be that

78
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,694
这两个矩阵是相似的权利，使
these two matrices are similar right so

79
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,914
也许我们应该表明我们想要的
maybe we should show that so we want to

80
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,974
以不同的方式写一个1所以这样
write a 1 in a different way so so the

81
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:52,274
声明是1是类似于我们只是
claim is a 1 is similar to a so we just

82
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,205
必须弄清楚我们必须得到1
have to figure out we have to get a 1

83
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:04,084
然后转到0所以这里是1ok所以1
and turn to a 0 so here is a 1 ok so a 1

84
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,154
那是我想表明那是对的
that's I want to show that that's right

85
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:14,714
所以这是我们的0Q0但是什么是Q0来自
so that's our 0 Q 0 but what is Q 0 from

86
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:21,884
这里Q0是我们的Q0是什么
here Q 0 is what we is our Q 0 is what

87
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,015
我想要将0反转
do I want I want to put our 0 inverse

88
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,144
所以我们的0现在为Q0我
over there so so our 0 now for Q 0 I'm

89
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:34,994
要替代究竟什么是Q0的我
gonna substitute so what is Q 0 its I

90
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,305
将该等式的两边乘以
multiply both sides of that equation by

91
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,865
我们的0逆，所以Q0是0对不起我
our 0 inverse so Q 0 is a 0 is sorry I

92
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,194
说a和写了一个000逆
said said a and wrote Q a 0 r 0 inverse

93
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,034
适合q0我适合它
right for for q0 i foot in what it

94
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:01,414
等于，而且已经完成了
equals and that's done it

95
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,735
那正是告诉我一个1
that's exactly telling me that a 1 which

96
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,274
这是等于这个，这是一个
is this equals this and that's a

97
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,704
相似性转换我没有
similarity transformation I have not

98
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:16,084
改变了特征值，这样就可以了
changed the eigen values so that's ok

99
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:20,054
这是喜欢你的另一件事
the other thing which is the like you

100
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,634
可以说这件事的奇迹是
could say the miracle in this thing is

101
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,164
当我继续这样做的时候
that when I continue to do that for

102
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,425
几乎每个矩阵都是矩阵开始的
almost every matrix the matrices begin

103
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,164
丢掉对角线上的东西
to lose stuff off the diagonal

104
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:37,754
尤其是在对角线以下
especially below the diagonal by the

105
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,265
命令QR完成它
ordering that that QR is done so it

106
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,875
你倾向于从矩阵a开​​始
you tend to you start with a matrix a

107
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:53,455
结你得到一个矩阵a1就像
knot you get a matrix a 1 which is like

108
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,594
这个部分有点小
a little smaller here this part being

109
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,504
坚果特别小，你再做一次
nuts especially smaller you do it again

110
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:06,325
这甚至更小，即便如此
this is even smaller even so I put even

111
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,465
小一个甚至更小，你保持
smaller a to even smaller and you keep

112
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,555
去而对于大多数矩阵结果
going and for most matrices the result

113
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,034
是我不知道我们有多少步骤
is that I don't know how many steps we

114
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,055
想要考虑，但我们相处得很好
want to think of taking but we get quite

115
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,154
这里的小数字尤其如此
small numbers here especially yeah so

116
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:31,555
一旦我们在这里得到一些小数字
once we get small numbers here little

117
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,395
小量的
Epsilon's

118
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,085
这是每个人的小写速记
that's everybody's shorthand for small

119
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,985
数字你期望什么
numbers what what would you expect to

120
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,935
在对角线上看到特征值
see on the diagonal the eigenvalues

121
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,245
因为它具有与之相同的特征值
because this has the same eigenvalues as

122
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,495
这就是这个和这些一点点
this as this is this and these little

123
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,525
epsilon沙皇不会改变
epsilon czar not going to change the

124
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,654
特征值太多，所以这些将会开启
eigenvalues too much so these will be on

125
00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:00,625
对角线将接近
the diagonal will be close to the

126
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,265
特征值实际上发生了什么
eigenvalues and actually what happens is

127
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,685
这是第一个
this one comes first

128
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,914
首先我想这个是非常准确的
that one is quite accurate first I guess

129
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,384
我们应该做一个简单的例子
we should probably do a simple example

130
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,754
看到这种情况实际上我做了一个
to see this happen actually I do an

131
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,175
注释中的例子，让我说一下
example in the notes and let me say what

132
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,034
发生了所以我做了两个两个例子
happens so I do a two by two example

133
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:33,144
这有点像costheta正弦
which has something like cos theta sine

134
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:38,605
theta哦，我不知道我是什么
theta oh I don't know what I've

135
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,005
忘了我拿了什么，我没有
forgotten what I took and I don't have

136
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,065
那里有一个人的笔记
that page of notes here somebody here

137
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,455
这里的东西在这里
something here something here

138
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:53,955
作为一个不是，然后一个刚刚
as a as a not and then a one after just

139
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:02,855
一步有正弦立方体那里和
one step has sine cubed theta there and

140
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,704
那里的数字越来越多了
numbers there that are getting a much

141
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,834
更接近特征值对不起这个
closer to the eigenvalue sorry that this

142
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,555
这不是一个全面的例子，而是重点
isn't a full-scale example but the point

143
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,685
这个例子就是这个
of the example is here that this this

144
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,834
关闭对角线元素得到了被立方和
off diagonal entry got gets cubed and

145
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,204
下一步将是第九步
the next step will it'll be its ninth

146
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,805
权力，然后是第27个权力所以它
power and then the 27th power so it's

147
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,475
真的很快就会到0而且这个
really quickly going to 0 and this

148
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,615
这是因为立方收敛是这样的
happens so with the cubic convergence is

149
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,405
你知道这是一个数字奖
you know that's a prize in numerical

150
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,765
线性代数就这样发生了
linear algebra so that's that happened

151
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,475
好的，所以这就到了现场
okay so this arrived on the scene and

152
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,785
迅速吹掉所有其他方法
quickly blew away all other methods that

153
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,395
被用来计算特征值
were being used to compute eigenvalues

154
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,795
但数字人就是他们自己
but numerical people being what they are

155
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,615
他们希望提高它喜欢的是有
they wanted to improve it like is there

156
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,704
一个办法让它更快，横空出世
a way to make it faster and turned out

157
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,175
事实证明，这更好
there is it turned out that the better

158
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:21,075
方式基本上是相同的想法，但只是你
way basically the same idea but just you

159
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,225
知道你总是在寻找一个简单的
know you're always looking for a simple

160
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:32,595
改变，这是想法
change and it was the idea of

161
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,665
尝试并转向引入转变
introducing a shift was tried and turned

162
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,065
出去工作非常好所以这样
out to work extremely well so so that's

163
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,565
这样的改进让我们知道了
the improvement so so we take a one know

164
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,915
那么这种转变是如何运作的呢？
so how does it how does this shift work

165
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,545
如果我有空间，而不是不是我
so instead of a not i if i got space

166
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,935
在这里做这个而不是结我
here to do do this instead of a knots i

167
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,505
不要
take a not

168
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,285
-转移所以转移是一些倍数
- shift so shift is some multiple of the

169
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,975
如果我只是移动一个矩阵的身份
identity if I just move a matrix by a

170
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,735
身份的多重性发生了什么
multiple of the identity what happens to

171
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,805
它的特征向量会发生什么
its eigenvectors what happens to its

172
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,655
特征值非常简单
eigenvalues something pretty simple

173
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,735
对，因为我只是换了si
right because I'm just shifting by si

174
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,645
他们的特征向量会发生什么
what happens to its eigenvectors they're

175
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,585
同样的这个以及发生了什么
the same this and what happens to the

176
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:31,105
如果a，它们的特征值会改变
eigenvalues they change by s this if a

177
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,725
不是v等于lambdav然后当我
not v equal lambda v then when I

178
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,555
将此乘以V将有一个
multiply this by V there will be an

179
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,225
额外它将是lambda减去s因为
extra it'll be lambda minus s because

180
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,915
V的身份时间就是V，所以
the identity times the V is just V so so

181
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,625
它只是移动所有的特征值
the it just shifts all the eigenvalues

182
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,825
通过s，你试图转移你寻找一个
by s and you try to shift you look for a

183
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,825
转移你如果你这将是伟大的
shift you this would be great if you

184
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,935
我知道lambdana会在那里转移
knew lambda n a shift there you would be

185
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,385
寻找0，那么如果他们转移
looking for 0 then if you shifted them

186
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,235
所有这些lambda都证明了这一点
all by that lambda and it turns out that

187
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,875
会加快速度，所以你工作
would speed things up so so it you work

188
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,685
而现在我用这个矩阵代替
instead with this matrix as now I'm

189
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,085
我再考虑Q无效R
again I'm factoring in the Q naught R

190
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,005
没有，所以这是方法的工作
naught so that's the work of the method

191
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,905
在每一步都在做克施密特
is in doing gram-schmidt at every step

192
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,105
然后有一点工作
and then there's a little work in

193
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:35,545
颠倒顺序然后我想
reversing the order and then I want to

194
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,395
撤消班次，所以我这样做
undo the shift so I so you do that

195
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,765
因素分解现在让我们看看你可能有
factorization now let's see you may have

196
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,705
帮助我记住我应该做的事情
to help me to remember what I should do

197
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,805
在这里，我将那些与我相反​​的因素分解
here so I factor those I reverse those

198
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,295
然后我想我补充了这个转变
and then I think I add back the shift

199
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:01,855
这是我的一个1，所以我花了我点头
and that's my a 1 so I took a nod I

200
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,995
转移它，我工作了它是
shifted it I worked with it q are

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,575
颠倒顺序是q加回来了
reversed the order are q added back the

202
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,055
转移得到一个矩阵，我是什么
shift to get a matrix and what what am i

203
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,595
当然希望
of course hoping of

204
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,375
矩阵a1，他们不是我希望的
the matrix a 1 and they not I'm hoping

205
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,105
他们仍然相似，我希望如此
they're still similar I'm hoping so I

206
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,194
做了一个转变，我解除了转变，但是
did a shift and I undid a shift and but

207
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,245
当然，在我做了QR之后
of course after after doing a QR I have

208
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,995
去检查
to check

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,595
这些真的仍然相似所以让我
are these really still similar so let me

210
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,685
试着再次检查一下我能不能
just try to check that one again can i

211
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,725
也许我只是坐在那里
maybe I'll just it's sitting right there

212
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,324
所以让我再做一次，我希望如此
so let me do it again I'm hoping that

213
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,334
我希望你知道的地方
I'm hoping that something you know where

214
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,975
我们改变了哦是的我们在这里展示了
did we change oh yeah here we showed

215
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,935
即A1是类似于一个结，我
that a1 was similar to a knot and I'm

216
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,625
希望甚至可能仍然如此
hoping that's probably still true even

217
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,655
你知道这种转变并没有弄乱
you know the the shift didn't mess that

218
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,644
我们只是尝试所以不是没有那个R
up let's just try so ain't no a that's R

219
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:12,514
没问题，没有加上si好了，现在
naught Q naught plus si okay and now

220
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,865
我要做什么我会去做什么
what am I going to do I'm going to what

221
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,274
在我弄清楚Q之前我做了什么
did i do before I figured out what Q

222
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,175
没有人是你从此记得如此
naught was from this you remember so so

223
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,915
这是我们的结，现在我必须放入Q.
this is our knot now I have to put in Q

224
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,105
没问题，但问题就是这件事
naught but Q naught is this thing

225
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,495
反向时间这是可行的
inverse times this is this gonna work

226
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,644
我想要我，但我不认为我
I'm I'm like hoping but I don't think I

227
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:48,454
想要得到它，不，不是没有问题
wanted to get that no it's not Q naught

228
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:55,415
那里有什么我放在这里，如果它
there what what do I put here and if it

229
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,434
不起作用我们会留下它
doesn't work we'll leave it as an

230
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:05,215
运动好，所以是的因为我没有
exercise okay so yeah cuz I didn't I

231
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,285
并没有某种方式开始
didn't sort of start right somehow

232
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,175
好吧，但让我继续前进
okay so but let me just push along to

233
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,605
看看会发生什么，所以我正在插电
see what happens so I'm I'm plugging in

234
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,754
对于Q在这里，我正在插入这个
for Q naught here I'm plugging in this

235
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,764
矩阵所以它不应该是
matrix so it shouldn't have been

236
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:24,905
颠倒它的时间并不相反
inverted it times are not inverse

237
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,855
谁知道它可能工作，谁知道这么
who knows it might work who knows so

238
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,185
这是没有问题的，也不是
that's the R naught Q naught right or is

239
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,655
每个人都跟我抱歉这个R.
everybody with me sorry about this R

240
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,014
没有逆，然后我必须添加s
naught inverse and then I have to add s

241
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:46,985
我，我做了什么
I so what have I done

242
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,485
我只是喜欢相信这一点
I'm just like pushed on believing that

243
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,774
这会起作用，因为它就是
this would work because it it's the

244
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,495
现在经常使用的方法
method that that is constantly used now

245
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,285
我有什么我有有它
do I have what do I have there is it

246
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,324
工作这是我们的不是
working this is our not a that was of

247
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,845
当然没有任何结果
course a naught R naught a naught R

248
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,824
没有逆R没有一个R
naught inverse R naught a naught R

249
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:23,314
没有反正的减去什么的
naught inverse good minus s what's

250
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,394
什么是我从那里得到的
what's what have I got there from from

251
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,704
不是-不知道那是什么
the are not - si R naught what is that

252
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:37,204
那是-我看起来很成功他们不是
that's - si I look success they are not

253
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,004
取消它们不是反向所以这个
cancels they are not inverse so this

254
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:43,564
该术语来自那个-
that term from from that that that is -

255
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,795
SI取消+S我完成哎哟
si cancels + s I am finished and lo and

256
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,925
看，我们有相同的相似性，所以我们
behold we have the same similarity so we

257
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,745
被多个人搞乱了
messed around by a multiple of the

258
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,225
身份并没有它实际上
identity and it didn't it it actually

259
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,105
如果我们这样做会使事情更快收敛
makes the thing converge faster if we

260
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,904
选择好的转变，但基本上
choose the shifts well and but basically

261
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:13,054
同样的想法仍然正常工作，所以这是
the same idea still working ok so that's

262
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,255
这就是QR方法以及这就是
that's the QR method well that's the

263
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,784
方法我们没有显示，也没有显示
method we haven't shown and won't show

264
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:26,375
除了这一半完成了
that except for this half half completed

265
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:32,615
例如，我不打算证明这一点
example we I don't plan to to prove that

266
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,395
下三角形部分开始
the lower triangular part begins to

267
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,945
消失
disappear

268
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,195
变小和小和
gets smaller and smaller and smaller and

269
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,235
那么特征值上弹出
then the eigenvalues pop up on the

270
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,515
对角线它是惊人的惊人的好吧
diagonal it's it's amazing amazing okay

271
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,424
现在我们还有其他改进吗？
now is there any other improvement we

272
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:58,135
可以做到这样的方法和地点
can make so that's the method and where

273
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,294
是工作和使用该方法
is the work and in using that method

274
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,965
因为那是我们一直关注的
because that's what we always focus on

275
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,025
我们在哪里花费电脑时间
where we spending computer time

276
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,895
好吧，我们花了很多时间在电脑上
well we're spending computer time in

277
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,485
做分数所以它
doing the doing the factorization so it

278
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,554
没有任何费用可以转移
didn't cost anything to shift by the

279
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,835
身份，但我们不得不考虑到这一点
identity but then we had to factor that

280
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,745
在QnaughtRnaught然后它没有
in the Q naught R naught then it didn't

281
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,235
花费很多钱来增加它们
cost much to multiply them in the

282
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,185
相反的顺序所以工作是在QR所以
opposite order so the work was in Q R so

283
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,414
我们能想到任何改进的事吗？
could we think of anything to improve

284
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,135
我想我能想到的那个方面
that aspect I think could we think of

285
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,414
什么都有，然后我们有一个
anything there and then we've got a

286
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:46,765
如果是真的一流的方法
really first class method well if the

287
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,575
矩阵我知道我们开始的矩阵
matrix a I know ik the matrix we started

288
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:59,575
有一些零允许我们
with had some zeros that that allowed us

289
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,924
跳过执行QR的步骤
to skip steps in doing the QR

290
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,044
因素分解所以我要说的是什么
factorization so so what am I gonna say

291
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:13,164
我要说一个或不是我们的原创
I'm gonna say if a or a not our original

292
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,435
矩阵有一堆零，让我们说
matrix has a bunch of zeros let's say

293
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,995
它有一大堆零的有
it's got a whole lot of zeros there

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,544
也许这很好我在这里过度了我
maybe it's well okay I overdid it here I

295
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,985
知道特征值，但是和
know the eigenvalues right off but and

296
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,465
所以说实话，我不能这么说
so the truth is I can't that saying that

297
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,115
如果它不会发生，但我们
if that it's not going to happen but we

298
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,565
可以用一个额外的对角线得到零
can get zeros with one extra diagonal

299
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,485
事实证明这是主要的
that turns out so that here's the main

300
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,355
对角大家
diagonal everybody

301
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,554
把目光投向主对角线和
got his eye on the main diagonal and and

302
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:02,395
如果我能得到很多，那就是一个对角线
and one diagonal if I can get a lot of

303
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,804
零，但我不能通过简单的计算
zeros but I can't by simple computation

304
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:10,885
所以我会告诉你如何得到一个，但我
so I'll show you how to get one but I

305
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,745
无法将所有负载都归零，因为
can't get all loads to be zero because

306
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,985
然后我会让特征值合适
then I would have the eigenvalues right

307
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,285
在那里，那我怎么知道我
there and that well how do I know that I

308
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,195
难道你不知道在淘汰
can't you know in an elimination

309
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,075
普通的解决斧头等于你真的
ordinary solving ax equal B you really

310
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,785
确实达到了上三角形式
do get to an upper triangular form right

311
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,655
一些运营商有些消除
some operator some some elimination

312
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,385
你插走的步骤和你的矩阵
steps you plug away and your matrix

313
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,835
成为上三角你和你
becomes upper triangular you and you're

314
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,205
金色
golden

315
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,294
但这太过于期待了
but that's too much to expect here in

316
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:51,445
事实上我们知道我们不能简单地做到这一点
fact we know we can't do it by simple

317
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,695
步骤因为如果我们能做到的话
steps because if we could do it

318
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,245
如果我们能和你一起去找你
if we could get to a you with with a

319
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,945
整个下三角部分为零
whole lower triangular part zero we

320
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,575
会发现特征值和我们
would have found the eigenvalues and we

321
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,424
知道特征值解决了一个系统
know that the eigenvalues solve a system

322
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,075
求解n次方程式和我们
solve an equation of nth degree and we

323
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,485
知道有人证明了一个世纪以来的世纪
know somebody proved centuries a century

324
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,605
或者更久以前你无法解决的问题
or more ago that you can't solve an

325
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,794
我们瞬间将它简单地等同于一点
instant we equate in by simple little

326
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,395
正确的步骤，你知道这是谁和
steps right do you know who that was and

327
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,424
并且你知道那个事实和
and that you know that fact and and and

328
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,835
它适用于什么程度
what degree does it apply to so that's

329
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,315
你有点重要的事实
an important fact in that you sort of

330
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,575
接受数学，是的，你是什么
pick up in in math yeah what are you

331
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,205
第五度啊所以5×5和
fifth degree yeah so five by five and

332
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,965
这将是不可能的
and up would be this is impossible

333
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,465
不可能不可能没有公式
impossible impossible there's no formula

334
00:21:49,470 --> 00:22:00,085
找到一个简单的公式为
to find a simple formula for the for the

335
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,605
lambda表达式
lambdas

336
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,135
并且类似地，天鹅座的
and similarly for the Cygnus the

337
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,335
奇异的价值所以论证是
singular values so the argument is

338
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,285
绝对是一种难度
definitely a level of difficulty beyond

339
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,385
ax等于B逆矩阵或
ax equal B the inverse matrix or

340
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,235
东西枢轴所有你能做的
something the pivots all that you can do

341
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,025
确切地说，如果你做我们的算术
exactly if you do exact arithmetic we

342
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:29,065
找不到lambdas，但我们
cannot find the lambdas exactly but we

343
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,105
因为我们希望能够得到尽可能接近再见
can get as close as we like bye-bye

344
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,615
继续使用QR方法，所以是的
continuing with the QR method so yes in

345
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,595
换言之，所以我们不能让我们不得不
other words so we can't get we have to

346
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,555
如果我们想要喜欢的话，我会满足于此
settle for if we want to like at the

347
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,465
我们之前开始改进我们的矩阵
beginning improve our matrix before we

348
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,665
开始做那些我们可以得到的东西
start doing that stuff we can get it

349
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,275
有一个额外的对角线，你知道吗？
with one extra diagonal and do you know

350
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,775
什么样的矩阵
what kind of a matrix

351
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,035
什么名字，我不知道为什么
what whose name and I don't know why

352
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,195
是的再说一遍
yeah say it again

353
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,205
鞋帮hessenburg所以鞋帮就像
upper hessen burg so upper is just like

354
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,715
上三角形它在那里，但关键
upper triangular it's up there but key

355
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,485
正如我所说，这个人的名字是Hessen出生的
person's name is Hessen birth i as i say

356
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,335
我就是这样的Hessenbert矩阵
i'm that's a Hessen bert matrix so

357
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,745
hesterberg矩阵是一个矩阵
hesterberg matrix is a matrix with one

358
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,025
三角加一个对角但是
triangular plus one more diagonal but

359
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,415
很多零，你知道N的顺序
lots of zeros you know order of N

360
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,235
像几乎一半的东西平方
squared something like almost like half

361
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,185
N平方不大，但接近零
N squared not quite but but close zeros

362
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,215
你能不能证明那些
and you would you could show that those

363
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,645
零在QR中保留为零
zeros stay zeros in Q R so that that

364
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,615
真的得到回报它减少削减了
really pays off it cuts the cuts the

365
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,715
努力工作，这是
work down significantly so that's the

366
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,935
完整的QR方法是第一步减少一个
full QR method is is step one reduce a

367
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:08,365
到了esenberg形式的零和我
to esenberg form with a zeros and when I

368
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,155
说减少我的意思是找到相似之处
say reduce I mean find a similarity

369
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,165
改变当然因为我是我
transformation of course because I'm I

370
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,835
想要特征值
want the eigenvalues

371
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,095
这最终和他的我一样
this to end up the same as the his'n I

372
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,165
我希望保持与我相同的特征值
want to keep the same eigenvalues as I

373
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,995
去，然后第二步是QR就此
go and then step two is QR on this

374
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,615
HessenBurgh矩阵与芯片这样的
Hessen Burgh matrix with chips so that's

375
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,155
将编程的代码
the code that would would be programmed

376
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:43,155
在项目中，这就是MATLAB和嗯
in item a that's what MATLAB and well

377
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,405
真的MATLAB像其他人一样吸引人
really MATLAB is appealing like other

378
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,735
矩阵系统很有吸引力
matrix systems is appealing to la pack

379
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,595
和Linpack你认识的团队
and Linpack you you know the team of

380
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,535
一种专业的数值分析师
sort of professional numerical analysts

381
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,815
真的花了很多精力和时间
really spend a lot of effort and time

382
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:10,115
这本书有十位作者
that the book la pack has ten authors

383
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,585
而且你可以下载它
and and you it's you you can download

384
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,205
任何这些代码都像
any any of these codes like the

385
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,555
特征值代码，这就是matlab
eigenvalue code so that's what matlab

386
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,425
这就是matlab自然而然的地方
that's where matlab naturally that's

387
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:31,275
代码的圣经是好的，是的
sort of the Bible for codes in okay yeah

388
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,495
我觉得这很有趣
that's I think it's sort of interesting

389
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,775
知道并且还有一件好事
to know and there's one more good thing

390
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,465
告诉你这个方法和它
to tell you about this method and it

391
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,885
如果矩阵是对称的，则适用
applies if the matrix is symmetric if

392
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,705
如果我们检查，矩阵是对称的
the matrix is symmetric then if we check

393
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,265
所有这一切，我们可以发现，矩阵
all this we could find that the matrices

394
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,745
如果结是对称的则保持对称
stayed symmetric if a knot is symmetric

395
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,325
我可以检查你可以轻松检查
I can check you could easily check

396
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,275
通过这个，你会发现
through this and you will discover that

397
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:08,655
a1也是对称的，是的你可以
a1 is also symmetric yes you can it

398
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,445
原来你有一个你可以改写
turns out you have a you could rewrite

399
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,055
这具有Q零和Q化为乌有
this with a Q naught and a Q naught

400
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,465
反过来另一边但是Q.
inverse on the other side but that Q

401
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,535
没有逆是与Q无关
naught inverse is the same as Q naught

402
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,245
转置，因为它是正交的
transpose because it's an orthogonal

403
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,325
如果，矩阵和对称性将会失效
matrix and symmetry would fall out so if

404
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,745
它是对称的，而它是hessin中的N.
it's symmetric and the N it's in hessin

405
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,495
伯格形式，它保持对称
Burgh form and it stays symmetric at

406
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,195
什么可以告诉我什么的每一步
every step what what can you tell me

407
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,205
关于对称的esenberg矩阵
about a symmetric esenberg matrix it's

408
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,115
只有得到你只是擦除所有这些
only got yeah you just erase all these

409
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,175
如果那里有零，如果有
if there are zeros there and if the

410
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:52,235
矩阵是对称的然后我们可以安全
matrix is symmetric then we can safely

411
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,455
预测它只会有一个
predict that it will only have one

412
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,305
一个非零对角线上方的对角线
diagonal above one nonzero diagonal

413
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,515
实际上它会说主要的日子
above the main day in fact it will say

414
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,135
对称所以现在我应该写
symmetric so now I'll be should write

415
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,225
对称Katzenberg的矩阵和等于
symmetric Katzenberg's matrix and equals

416
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:22,475
三对角主要是三对角线
tri diagonal major yeah three diagonals

417
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,395
所以现在你真的减少了时间
so now you really have reduced the time

418
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,285
做QR，所以我说你有一个三
to do QR so I said you've got a tri

419
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,315
对角矩阵它将保持三对角线
diagonal matrix it'll stay tri diagonal

420
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,135
在所有这些步骤中，你正在工作
in all these steps so you're working

421
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,045
实际上只有三个n数
with just three n numbers well actually

422
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,285
两个因为它们在对角线上面而且
two n because they're diagonal above and

423
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,685
下面的对角线和你一样
the diagonal below are the same you're

424
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,695
只使用两个n数字
working with just two n numbers instead

425
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,425
N平方的顺序，它就像
of order N squared and it just goes like

426
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,445
一枚炸弹让我对称
a bomb so that's I for symmetric

427
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,925
矩阵，你看到它就是全部
matrices and you see that it was all

428
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:00,495
真的是那里的核心
based there really the heart of the the

429
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:08,565
算法的核心是QR好吧
heart of the algorithm was QR okay so

430
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,785
这是我的一半课程报告
that's my took half the class to report

431
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:22,245
在igwe找到的最喜欢的方式
on the favorite way to igwe to find

432
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,485
特征值哦我应该说些什么
eigenvalues oh I should say something

433
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,955
关于看到其他价值如此奇异
about seen the other values so singular

434
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,645
值当然是奇异值
values of course the the singular values

435
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,115
矩阵的特征值是a的特征值
of the matrix are the eigenvalues of a

436
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,524
转置一个
transpose a

437
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:41,384
平方根的平方根
square root square root of those

438
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:44,235
特征值，但你不会这样做
eigenvalues but you wouldn't do it that

439
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,215
你永远不会形成一个转置的方式
way you would never form a transpose a

440
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,764
好吧，我没有提到另一个
well I didn't mention that the other

441
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,225
你永远不会这样做的事情
thing you would never ever ever do so

442
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,225
让我把它放在这里就像在
let me just put it here this is like in

443
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,975
耻辱地解决这个问题
disgrace to solve that equation it's

444
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,674
好的，你知道回到一年级
like okay you know back to first grade

445
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,065
因为那不是很糟糕的
because that's not it's very bad a

446
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,345
决定因素首先是它
determinant come first of all it's

447
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,304
极其缓慢极为缓慢和
extremely slow extremely slow and

448
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:20,315
确定它正在打包这一切
determined it is packing all this

449
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,674
把信息放到最后
squared pieces of information into end

450
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,945
系数，它是绝望的
coefficients and it's hopelessly

451
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,955
病态，是的，你只是输了
ill-conditioned yeah you just you lose

452
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,504
所有信息的时间，所以它真的
information all the time so it's really

453
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:36,374
如果这是在相机上它更好
my if this is going on camera it better

454
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:39,495
和X一起去相机，因为它
go on camera with a with an X because it

455
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,325
不要这样做是的，所以我在哪里
don't do it okay yeah so where was I

456
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:53,835
奇异值，所以转置一个
singular values so a transpose a so

457
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,674
让我们再想想你能做些什么
again let's think about what you could

458
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,884
在开始之前开始做
do at the beginning before starting on

459
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:06,735
qr4用于转置a或用于矩阵
qr4 for a transpose a or for the matrix

460
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,134
什么你可以用正交做什么
a what what could you do with orthogonal

461
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:15,105
矩阵所以我猜我们做了什么
matrices so so I guess what what did we

462
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,924
说关于对称矩阵，所以这里
say about symmetric matrices so here's

463
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,235
我说过对称矩阵，如果
what I said about symmetric matrices if

464
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,235
你给我一个对称矩阵我可以在
you give me a symmetric matrix I can in

465
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,024
只需简单的一些简单步骤
just a simple number of simple steps

466
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:31,874
使它成三角我无法做到
make it tri diagonal I can't make it

467
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:33,735
对角线，因为那时我会找到
diagonal because then I'd be finding the

468
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,745
特征值和亚伯是第一个
eigenvalues and Abel who was the first

469
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,815
有人看到这是不可能的
person to see that that was impossible

470
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,524
会禁止的
would would forbids it

471
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:46,845
但是让我让我写下来的是什么
but so what let me let me write down

472
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,884
如果我有一个，我在这说什么
what I'm saying here if I have a

473
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,935
对称矩阵S
symmetric matrix s

474
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,985
我可以找到一堆Q和Q.
I can find a bunch of Q's and Q

475
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,925
转置，我可以把它们全部
transpose and I can put them all

476
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,805
一起成为一个大Q和它
together into one big Q and it's

477
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,775
转置以及我对此有何了解
transpose and what do I know about the

478
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:10,045
该矩阵的特征值只是Q
eigenvalues of that matrix let's just Q

479
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,655
是正交总是那么你能做什么
is orthogonal always so what can you

480
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,505
告诉我你的情况和Q一样
tell me about thee this is the same as Q

481
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,315
sQ逆，因此是本征
s Q inverse and therefore the eigen

482
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,225
值是它类似于它同
values are the same it's similar to it

483
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:36,925
我发现它变成了三角形
and it becomes tri diagonal after I find

484
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:43,435
一个好的q现在，因此同样的lambdas
a good q now and therefore same lambdas

485
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,395
哪个三角形与同一个lambdas
which tri diagonal with the same lambdas

486
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,795
现在我在想什么约我在这里
now what am I thinking about here I'm

487
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,495
想着告诉我相应的
thinking about tell me the corresponding

488
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,095
关于我想要的奇异值的可能性
possibility about singular values I want

489
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,245
现在，我正在为我的矩阵做点什么
to do something to my matrix now I'm I'm

490
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:11,665
总是采用一般矩阵a而我
always taking a general matrix a and I'm

491
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,305
寻找它的奇异价值，我
looking for its singular values and I'm

492
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,355
希望简化它，我是什么
looking to simplify it and what am I

493
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,465
允许做是的我想我的问题
allowed to do yeah I guess my question

494
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,395
是相似的转变离开了
is similarity transformations left the

495
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,365
单独的特征值我能做什么呢
eigenvalues alone what can I do that

496
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,335
独自离开了奇异值这
leaves the singular values alone that's

497
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,975
一个根本问题，因为它是如此
a fundamental question because it was so

498
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,795
做的特征值的基础
fundamental for eigenvalues by doing

499
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,395
这是一个矩阵，它与我相反
this a matrix and it's inverse I got

500
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,515
类似的东西，即使在即时检查
something similar and ie checked even in

501
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,785
这个类的特征值相同
this class that the eigenvalues same

502
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,715
lambda表达式
lambdas

503
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,055
现在我想在结束了整条生产线
now I want a whole line that ends up

504
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,935
和Sigma一样，我想要你
with the same Sigma's and I want you to

505
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,765
告诉我我被允许做什么
tell me what I'm allowed to do to the

506
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,995
矩阵而不改变Sigma的
matrix without changing the Sigma's

507
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,715
这是一个也许不要喊出来
that this is a maybe don't shout it out

508
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,835
马上让每个人都想到了什么
immediately let everybody think what am

509
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,775
我允许对每个矩阵做一个矩阵
I allowed to do to a matrix every matrix

510
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,045
我有这些奇异的价值观
has got these singular values and now I

511
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,365
想要使它成为一个更好的矩阵
want to make it a better matrix with

512
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:27,005
如果我做的话，更多零或什么的
more zeros or something if I if I do

513
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,005
那就是它
that to it

514
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,915
这会改变西格玛的能力吗？
does that change the Sigma's can I do

515
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,295
不仅如此，我还能做些什么
more than that to it what can I do it

516
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,895
什么样的矩阵将有什么
what what group of matrices will have

517
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,885
同样的西格玛作为我的起始矩阵a
the same Sigma's as my starting matrix a

518
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,335
所以这是一个基本的基本问题
so that's a basic basic question about

519
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,705
关于看到他们的价值观和
that about seeing their values and the

520
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,605
SVD让我们，让我们觉得答案
SVD so let's let's think of the answer

521
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,805
一起好吧所以它已经连接起来了
together okay so it's got it's connected

522
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,975
到SVD所以让我记住SVD
to the SVD so let me remember the SVD

523
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,405
SVD我有一些正交矩阵
the SVD I have some orthogonal matrix

524
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,795
那么矩阵SV的奇异值
then the singular value of the matrix SV

525
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,795
强迫他们的价值观，然后另一个
force into their values and then another

526
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,525
正交矩阵我能做些什么
orthogonal matrix what could I do to

527
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,135
那个不会触及这个的等式
that equation that would not touch this

528
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:28,105
伙计，所以我问的是什么不变性
guy so I'm asking what invariance

529
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,085
因为不接触它意味着离开它
because not touching it means leaving it

530
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,775
不变，所以我在寻找什么
on not varying so I'm looking for what

531
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,005
在什么操作下是什么
what under what operations are the

532
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,435
我的奇异值不变
singular values invariant when I was

533
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,165
看着特征值，这就是
looking at eigen values this was the

534
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,685
操作很好，它不一定是
operation well it didn't have to be

535
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,315
正交的东西然后是逆的
orthogonal something then it's inverse

536
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,745
但现在又是什么呢
but now what is it up there what what

537
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:58,055
我可以做那个矩阵吗？
could I do to that matrix a could I

538
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,325
当我投入时，我可以乘以Q
multiply by Q could I when I throw in

539
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,395
有问题，甚至可能在另一方面
there Q it may be not even on the other

540
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,885
如果我输入正交Q，我会结束
end if I if I throw in an orthogonal Q

541
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,075
我可以改变奇异值吗？
do I change the singular values or do I

542
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,245
不改变根本问题
not change the fundamental question the

543
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,355
答案是
answer is

544
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,575
不，我不改变他，我被允许做
no I don't change him I'm allowed to do

545
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,895
因为这是一个正交矩阵
that because here's an orthogonal matrix

546
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,175
水性时候，你如果这两个都
aq times you if both of those are

547
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,905
正交然后产品是对的
orthogonal then the product is right

548
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,845
大家都知道，如果是两个产品
everybody knows that if a product of two

549
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,485
正交矩阵仍然是正交的
orthogonal matrix is still orthogonal

550
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:39,095
更好地知道我不知道是的
better know that I don't know that yeah

551
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,375
所以，如果我有一个正交矩阵Q和
so if I have an orthogonal matrix Q and

552
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,675
一个正交矩阵我声称这个
an orthogonal matrix u I claim that this

553
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,905
仍然是抱歉，我该如何检查
is still what sorry and how do I check

554
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,455
好吧我用了一些测试
it well I use some tests for

555
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,915
正交性会是什么
orthogonality what would be that what

556
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,175
测试你喜欢使用逆是
tests you like to use the inverse is the

557
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,945
和转置一样你喜欢那样吗？
same as the transpose do you like that

558
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:10,575
测试所以我会反转它Qu逆
test so I'll invert it Q u inverse of

559
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,335
当然对于任何U逆Q的矩阵
course for any matrix that's U inverse Q

560
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,625
反过来但这些是分开的
inverse but these were separately

561
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,205
正交使得U转置Q.
orthogonal so that's U transpose Q

562
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:26,975
转置，这与Qu相同
transpose and that is the same as Q u

563
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:32,805
转置是的所以我使用了
transpose yeah so I used the

564
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,565
U的正交性和正交性
orthogonality of U and the orthogonality

565
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,585
Q得出结论反过来是
of Q to conclude that the inverse is the

566
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,045
转置所以答案是肯定的我可以
transpose so the answer is yes I could

567
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,765
现在用奇异的价值来做
do that now with singular value with

568
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,065
特征值我不得不繁殖
eigenvalues I had to I had to multiply

569
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,695
上由Q逆或Q的另一侧
on the other side by Q inverse or Q

570
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,075
转置，我现在必须这样做
transpose do I have to do that now no

571
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,755
我能做些什么在右边我
what can I do on the right-hand side I

572
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,095
可以乘以我可以不管它
can multiply by I can leave it alone

573
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,375
那么它具有相同的奇异值
then it has the same singular values

574
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,805
因为如果我，那就是那个sigmund
because it's the same sigmund there if I

575
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,205
有一个正交矩阵乘以
have a orthogonal matrix times the

576
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,245
正交的对角线倍
diagonal times of orthogonal that

577
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,395
对角线是正对角线
diagonal is positive diagonal is going

578
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,655
是西格玛现在还等什么我可以做
to be Sigma now so what what can I do on

579
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,835
这方面我可以乘以任何
this side I can multiply by any

580
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,565
哦，这一切都在矩阵上
oh it's all going on matrix on that side

581
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,445
太让我们把这个家伙Q1，这
too so let's call this guy q1 and this

582
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,165
伙计q2我还是有一个
guy q2 I'm still I still have an

583
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,325
正交矩阵它们是正交的
orthogonal matrix they're orthogonal

584
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,685
矩阵在那里和相同的西格玛弹出
matrix there and the same Sigma popped

585
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,965
在中间这就是你的意思
in the middle so that's what you're

586
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:50,425
允许这样做可以给我们更多的自由
allowed to do that gives us more freedom

587
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,575
在我们必须做的事情之前
before we got when we had to do

588
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,225
具有相同的相似变换
similarity transformations with the same

589
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:01,915
我们得到它是三角形但是现在
guy we got it to be tri diagonal but now

590
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,045
我们被允许做更多的事情
we're allowed to do more stuff we're

591
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,405
允许使用不同的正交
allowed to use different orthogonal

592
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,615
左边和右边的矩阵和我们
matrices on the left and right and we

593
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,105
可以从三进一步减少它
can reduce it even further from tri

594
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:18,245
对角线由斜的，因此这样的
diagonal to by diagonal so the so the

595
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,875
第一步是0步骤
first step is getting 0 the the step of

596
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,415
越来越零降低它一路
getting zeros reduces it all the way to

597
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:31,595
那里有所有的零，所以它是
that with all the zeros there so it's

598
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:39,845
然后我就更容易了
it's it's easier then then I work on

599
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,605
这，这是我利用工作矩阵
this this is the matrix I work on using

600
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,475
QR类型的想法有些像
a QR type idea some some method like

601
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,875
所以每个人都看到我们是这样的
that so so everybody's seeing that we're

602
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,845
我们的算法得到两个
taking where our algorithm is got two

603
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,705
阶段一是得到很多零和得到
stages one is get a lot of zeros and get

604
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,495
他们在那些将保持零的地方
them in places that will stay zero as

605
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,215
第二部分算法开始了
part two of the algorithm gets going and

606
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,785
然后运行你想要的算法的第二部分
then run part two of the algorithm you'd

607
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,385
其染色的每个步骤是非常快的
stain with its each step is very fast

608
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,595
现在因为做QR分解了
now because doing a QR factorization is

609
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,925
快，但有一个问题，是的，是的
fast but was there a question yeah yep

610
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,295
所以我会称之为
so this would I would call this by

611
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,425
对角线当然和每个人
diagonal of course and everybody

612
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,825
我认识到如果我有一个对角线
recognizes that if I have a by diagonal

613
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:34,675
矩阵称之为或不是或等等
matrix call it a or a not or whatever

614
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,595
转移你怎么想？
then a transfer what do you think about

615
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,005
转置a
a transpose a

616
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,205
如果那是一个转置的话会是什么？
what would a transpose a if that was a

617
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,115
什么你能告诉我一个转
what could you tell me about a transpose

618
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:53,725
你能不能像矩阵那样乘以矩阵
a could you multiply matrices like

619
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,435
知道非零的位置
knowing that where the non zeros are

620
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,285
喜欢在你的头脑中，并了解
like in your head and get an idea of

621
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,525
如果我有一个对角线矩阵那么所以
where so if I have a by diagonal matrix

622
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:08,225
一个那么几分含蓄的SVD我
a then sort of implicitly in the SVD I'm

623
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,405
看一个转置a和什么会
looking at a transpose a and what would

624
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,995
我对转置的看法是真实的
I what would be true about a transpose a

625
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,715
这将是三角形所以我所做的
it would be tri diagonal so what I've

626
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,865
在这里完成，我刚刚在那里完成了
done here and what I've done there just

627
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,905
如果你匹配你可以歌剧
match up you can you can opera if you

628
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,765
不想改变你的奇异价值
don't want to change singular values you

629
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,455
可以一路到这里，但后来
can get all the way to here but then to

630
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,045
找到那些他们价值观的东西
find those thing of their values that

631
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,685
将涉及转置它将是
would involve a transpose a it would be

632
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,145
对称和三对角然后
symmetric and tri diagonal and then

633
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,105
你会在那场比赛中右好了，
you'd be in that game right okay so

634
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,335
这就是Ag的基本事实
that's those are the basic facts of Ag

635
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,395
和SVD的顺序为a的矩阵
and SVD for matrices of order up to a

636
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,755
千说我不知道​​我还不够
thousand say I don't know I'm not enough

637
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,725
专家知道哪里更高
of an expert to know where higher

638
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:09,815
因为在完美的数学中它是
because the in in perfect math it's

639
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,325
要采取无限的步骤或阿巴
gonna take infinitely many steps or Abba

640
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,565
他会的，会非常惊讶
would be very surprised right he would

641
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,145
看到你解决特征值和
see you solving for eigenvalues and

642
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,275
通过一大堆的瞬间方程
instantly equation by a whole lot of

643
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,835
小步骤，准确地得到它们
little steps and getting them exactly

644
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,355
正确的，这不会发生，但你让他们
right that won't happen but you get them

645
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,555
在epsilon中的许多步骤
within epsilon in a number of steps

646
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,905
这就像n立方体那么漂亮
that's like n cubed so that's pretty

647
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,575
令人印象深刻的特征值问题是
impressive the eigenvalue problem is

648
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:43,655
用a引用来解决引用
being solved in quotes by by an out by a

649
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:47,135
快速的方法，这会让你
fast method that that that gets you a

650
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,965
在n立方体的公差范围内的良好答案
good answer within a tolerance in n cube

651
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,405
正确的步骤，这样就可以了
steps right so that's great as long as

652
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,155
一个不是
an isn't too

653
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,205
然后当n太大时
and then when n is too big which of

654
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,324
当然，你必须再考虑一下
course happens you have to think again

655
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:07,564
所以这种方法将是一个巨人
so this method will be is a giant

656
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:13,324
然后，成功到大型矩阵
success up to large matrices but then

657
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,625
你必须再思考一下，是什么
you have to think again and what is

658
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,155
我猜想再次参与思考
involved in thinking again well I guess

659
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,324
更多的思考如果你做了什么
more thinking so what do you do if the

660
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:26,614
矩阵更大
matrix is bigger

661
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:33,304
我猜那个克里洛夫的下一个
I guess that the next that that Krylov

662
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:36,995
会说使用我的方法所以克里洛夫会
would say use my method so Krylov would

663
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,425
特别是如果你的矩阵很稀疏
say especially if your matrix was sparse

664
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,564
我们能记住Krylov是什么吗？
can we just remember what Krylov was

665
00:42:42,569 --> 00:42:45,864
克雷洛夫以矢量b开头
Krylov started with a vector b

666
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:50,604
乘以乘以a乘以
multiplied it by a multiply that by a

667
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:59,004
并起身让我们说到999B
and got up to let's say a to the 999 B

668
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,945
所以现在他得到了我们出关叫道它的
so now he's got us out cried off it's

669
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,375
他有一个千维空间
got a thousand dimensional space he's

670
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,784
有一千个载体的基础
got a basis for it thousand vectors that

671
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:12,985
跨越千维空间和
span a thousand dimensional space and

672
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,985
他将着眼于只在该矩阵
he'll look at the matrix a only on that

673
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:20,915
换句话说，我不会进入空间
space in other words I won't go into

674
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,125
关于他的细节限制了
detail about that he restricts the

675
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,344
这个千维的矩阵
matrix to this thousand dimensional

676
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:30,094
空间，他希望它能抓住我们
space and he hopes that it's captured we

677
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:32,405
但我们希望，特征向量
it we hope that the eigenvector is

678
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,375
几乎几乎在那个空间和
almost virtually in that space and

679
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,044
实际上我不会不去
actually I wouldn't wouldn't go up to

680
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:42,814
让我从那百人中拿出九分
let me take a nine out of that hundred

681
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:45,064
维度可能会抓住
dimensional would probably catch the

682
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:47,465
特征向量，如果特征向量是
eigenvector so if the eigenvector is

683
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,155
几乎在这个空间，我们可以看
virtually in this space then we can look

684
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,885
在一个数百万的矩阵我们可以
at a matrix of order a hundred we can

685
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,965
把它放下来看看它的行动
bring a down to just see its action on

686
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:04,415
那个空间和任何一块如此
that space and any piece of so when so

687
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,054
这是一个所以我看看矢量V
here's a so I look at vectors V which

688
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:11,135
是一些组合C1B
are some combination C 1 B

689
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:17,254
加C到B加C3平方B和C.
plus C to a B plus C 3 a squared B and C

690
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:28,494
100到99到B再加上一个错误
100 a to the 99 to B plus it an error

691
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:36,004
我会忽略那个错误，因为
and I'm gonna ignore that error because

692
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:38,705
我已经走了，我已经达到100维了
I've gone I've got up to dimension 100 I

693
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,504
可能会说是非常安全的忽略
probably say is pretty safe to ignore

694
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:45,604
那个错误，然后在这个空间
that error and then in this space just

695
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:48,484
无论在哪里，都要看矩阵
looking at the matrix a so wherever a to

696
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:51,004
第100个进入忘记它
the 100th comes in forget it

697
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:54,744
只要想想矩阵a就像
just think about the matrix a as as

698
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:57,665
在这里乘以这种矢量
multiplying vectors of this kind in this

699
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,725
空间然后我有一百个百
space then I have a hundred by hundred

700
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:06,415
也许我可以重视一个问题，你知道
maybe I can value a problem and you know

701
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,314
大矩阵a被简化为矩阵
the big matrix a is reduced to a matrix

702
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:14,195
大小100你看到了什么
of size 100 by do you see sort of what

703
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,385
我是说，即使d我不是
I'm saying even though the D I'm not

704
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:21,625
给人的细节，是想的
giving the details that that think of a

705
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,885
一个大小一百万的矩阵的东西
thing of a matrix a of size a million

706
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,994
然后你将它应用于Krylov载体，所以我
and you apply it to Krylov vectors so I

707
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:34,675
称他们为Krylov矢量小K.
call them little K for a Krylov vector

708
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:41,405
在这个百维空间中如此
in this hundred dimensional space so

709
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:46,834
他们有一百万减100零
they have a million minus 100 zero

710
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:49,415
组件，你可以说这没关系这
components you could say this okay this

711
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,915
在Krylov空间这是一百万
is in the Krylov space this is a million

712
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,175
K一百
K a hundred

713
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,864
哦，它是一个完整的有一个它有一个
oh it's a full there's a it's got a

714
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:02,905
百万组件，但它只是
million components but it's out of just

715
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,915
一个百维空间，所以当我
a hundred dimensional space so when I

716
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,465
乘以它就会有它
multiplied by a it'll have it'll be

717
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:13,255
大多数情况下，部分在Krylov
mostly in mostly in partly in the Krylov

718
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,534
空间K数百和一块出的K
space k hundreds and a piece out of K

719
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:23,695
100，我只是忽略了那一部分
100 and I just ignore that part of the

720
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,665
矩阵所以我有一百一百
matrix so I have a hundred by hundred

721
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,614
问题，我解决了找到
problem and I solve the find the

722
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,895
特征值，它们非常好
eigenvalues and they're pretty good

723
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,195
近似于特征值
approximation to the eigenvalues to the

724
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,344
可我希望喜欢的最低百
may i hopefully like the lowest hundred

725
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:40,314
特征值我想知道但是我
eigenvalues i'd like to know that but i

726
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,375
可能不确定这个想法会不会
might not be sure that this idea would

727
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,895
给我第一个最低的百分之一
give me the lowest hundred the first

728
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,385
一百个特征值
hundred eigenvalues of the of the

729
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,324
百万阿玛丽亚的矩阵我是
million of the matrix of size Amelia I'm

730
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:55,935
这里只需几分钟
just taking a few minutes here to to

731
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:01,765
那种波什么克雷洛夫手中
sort of wave hands about what Krylov the

732
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,135
克里洛夫的想法会做，我可能
Krylov idea would do and I probably

733
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,044
本学期不会再提Krylov了
won't mention Krylov again this semester

734
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:11,125
所以它能做的就是看看这个
so what it can do is look at this

735
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:15,294
特殊类型的空间，因为我们可以
particular type of space because we can

736
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,534
快速获得它的基础
get a basis for it quickly just multiply

737
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:21,445
我们可以一次又一次地
again and again by a then we can

738
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,834
正交化这个基础
orthogonalize that basis

739
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,054
这是某种形式的克施密特
that's gram schmidt in some some form

740
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:28,645
我们总是回到盛大
we're always going back to a grand

741
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,774
施密特然后我有一百一百
Schmitt then I have a hundred by hundred

742
00:47:30,779 --> 00:47:33,715
我有一个大小为a的子空间
I have a bate a subspace of size a

743
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,114
一百个我看着Mait为了什么
hundred I look at the Mait for what the

744
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,175
矩阵在那个空间里做，我
matrix does in that space and that I

745
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,044
可以找我能找到特征值
could look for I could find eigenvalues

746
00:47:43,049 --> 00:47:45,265
被限制在那个空间他们
were restricted to that space they

747
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,455
不会是完美的特征值但是
wouldn't be the perfect eigenvalues but

748
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,685
他们会准确的好，所以我没有
they would be accurate okay so I didn't

749
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,324
知道它会采取一个班时间
know it would take one class time to

750
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,364
谈论寻找特征值和特征
talk about finding eigenvalues and

751
00:47:56,369 --> 00:47:58,435
奇异的价值，但我们做了一些
singular values but we did some

752
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,725
我们记得那些重要的事情
important things we remembered that

753
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,425
相似性是检查事物的事情
similarity is the thing to check thing

754
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,824
保存，因为它不会改变
to preserve because it doesn't change

755
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:11,025
特征值，然后我们
the eigen values and then we

756
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,035
对于奇异的价值观是什么
for singular values what was the thing

757
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,915
你可以乘左右的
you could multiply left and right by

758
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,645
不同的正交矩阵和
different orthogonal matrices and

759
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,745
不知怎的，也许没有
somehow maybe that doesn't have a

760
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,155
已建立的名称乘以左和
established name multiplying left and

761
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,715
通过q1和aq2转换是的
right by a q1 and a q 2 transpose yeah

762
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,835
但但这个想法是明确的，
but but the idea is clear and that

763
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,825
不改变我们的奇异值
doesn't change the singular values we're

764
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:42,835
准备现在变成真实的，也许
ready to move now into real and maybe

765
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,775
我们下一步我们不花钱
our next step which we don't spend a

766
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,165
很长一段时间会像随意的
long time on will be like random

767
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,895
如果您的矩阵是正确的，那么采样
sampling what if your matrix is just way

768
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,815
太大
too big

769
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:58,375
所以这是一个新的非常新的想法很
so that's a new very new idea very

770
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,805
数值线性的不同想法
different idea in numerical linear

771
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,275
代数就是对矩阵进行采样
algebra is just to sample the matrix

772
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,835
你能相信答案吗？
could you believe that the answer is

773
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,035
要出来吧
going to come out right

774
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,795
只是随机抽样的几率
just for a random sample well the odds

775
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,545
对你有好处，那就是那个
are in your favor okay so that's that'll

776
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,705
星期三然后我们有很多
be Wednesday and then we have lots of

777
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:23,000
new we'll move onward after that okay

778
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:26,660
新的我们之后好向前移动

779
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:26,660
看你周三谢谢
see your Wednesday Thanks
