好吧，我只想说下一个话题
okay let me just say our next topic

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,495
真正走向机器学习
moving really toward machine learning

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,185
将是该部分的最后一部分
would be the last section of section of

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,005
第六章关于随机梯度
chapter six about stochastic gradient

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:46,595
下降我认为教授sois来自
descent I think professor sois from

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,105
计算机科学就是他能够做到的
computer science is if he's able he will

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,295
星期五上课并告诉我们
take the class Friday and tell us about

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,354
性病随机梯度下降
STDs stochastic gradient descent

17
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,655
关键算法我的意思是在a
critical algorithm I mean that at a

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,705
快速浏览
quick look

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,695
随机梯度下降就是这样
stochastic gradient descent is does

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,114
一次较小的批次，所以它
smaller batches at a time so it's

21
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,825
计算速度比纯粹快
computationally faster than pure

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,215
梯度下降但也随机
gradient descent but also stochastic

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,815
梯度下降是能够解决的
gradient descent is able to solve

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,135
你所处的概率问题
probabilistic problems where you're

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,355
试图最小化预期值
trying to minimize an expected value

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,525
而不是功能，无论如何它是一个
instead of a function anyway it's a

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,974
重要的是实际上有一个
important thing actually there's a

28
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,534
讲座下午两点在大脑中
lecture at two o'clock in brain in

29
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:41,204
关于梯度下降的神经科学
neuroscience about the gradient descent

30
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,335
算法然后是博伊德教授
algorithms and then professor Boyd is

31
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,435
今天下午4:30在这里发言
speaking here at 4:30 this afternoon

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,185
它是压倒性的，所以我要去
it's overwhelming so so I'm going to

33
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:57,064
今天谈谈几个主题
talk today about several topics that are

34
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,515
优化线性的特定部分
specific parts of optimization linear

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,945
编程是一个非常着名的部分
programming is a very famous part of

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,924
优化我不知道你是否见过面
optimization I don't know if you've met

37
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,545
我觉得值得知道的是什么
it I think it's worth knowing that what

38
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,734
输入是什么，关键事实是什么
the inputs are and what's the key fact

39
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,745
关于线性编程，当然
about linear programming and of course

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,014
还有什么算法
also what are the algorithms that's

41
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:23,535
通常我们想知道的是什么
usually what we want to know what's the

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,505
问题是什么的结果
problem what are the results the

43
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,575
数学结果又是什么
mathematical results and what are the

44
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,725
计算工具是的，所以这是一个
computational tools yeah so that's a

45
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,965
非常确定的最大流量最小切割是
very established max-flow min-cut is

46
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,515
一旦
once

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,555
特别是线性编程我
specifically linear programming that I

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,015
想想也许会成为最好的
think maybe would serve as the best

49
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,905
例子然后是双人游戏
example and then two-person games

50
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,035
你见过那些人吗？你知道吗？
have you met those do so would you know

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,705
两个人的规则是什么
what what the rules are at a two-person

52
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,695
零和游戏那些是游戏中的游戏
zero-sum game those are the in game

53
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,375
理论那些是明确的
theory those are the ones that are clear

54
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:04,225
那里的一切都很好
everything's well established there and

55
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,685
实际上它们相当于或线性
in fact they're equivalent to or linear

56
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,145
程序，这就是为什么这两个是
programs so that's why those two are

57
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,285
进入今天然后是关键事实
coming in today and then the key fact

58
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,165
关于两人游戏和关于线性
about two-person games and about linear

59
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,955
编程是二元的，所以如果有的话
programming is duality so if there's any

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,695
在那个板上的字是它的一个
word on that board it's the one in

61
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,685
具有大量内容的大写字母
capital letters that has mass content

62
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,115
好吧，我只是从线性开始
okay I'm just going to start with linear

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,545
程序，然后继续前进好吧，那是什么
program and then move on okay so what's

64
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,335
它是一个线性编程线性程序
a linear programming linear program it's

65
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,645
我们正在优化线性成本函数
we're optimizing a linear cost function

66
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,605
所以我们花一分钟来降低成本C.
so we're a minute minimizing the cost C

67
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,204
转置X使得向量X是
transpose X so that vector X is the

68
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,085
不知道我们正在寻找和这个
unknown that we're looking for and this

69
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,845
矢量C是成本载体中，从而是
vector C is the cost vector so that is

70
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,685
c1x1加上CNxn所以你可以看到原因
c1 x1 plus plus CN xn so you can see why

71
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,185
它被称为线性编程
it's called linear programming

72
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,185
成本是约束的线性
the cost is linear the constraints are

73
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:15,195
也是线性的，所以对X的约束是
also linear so the constraints on X are

74
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,454
我当然是一套线性方程组
set of linear equations of course I'm

75
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,795
没想到是一个正方形
not thinking of a as being a square

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,005
可逆矩阵如果是那样就没办法了
invertible matrix no way if it were that

77
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,955
会告诉我们X必须是什么，我们
would tell us what X had to be and we

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,535
我们的问题将在于我们拥有的问题
our problem would be over we we have we

79
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,625
有n个未知数，当然这是M？
have n unknowns this is M by n of course

80
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,955
X是n乘1，这是我们未知的向量
X is n by 1 that's our unknown vector

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,925
而且我在想M会更小
and I'm thinking that M will be smaller

82
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,125
比n，但我们确实有约束和
than n but we do have constraints and

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,155
现在变成了线性的东西
now comes the thing that makes linear

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,605
编程不是没有真正的线性和
programming not not actually linear and

85
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,314
这是约束X更大的等于
that's the constraint X greater equal

86
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,555
零，我把它写成矢量
zero and I've written that as a vector

87
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,465
但这意味着x1更大
but that means that means x1 greater

88
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,985
到X等于零所以这是一个向量
equals zero on to X so it's a vector

89
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,694
不平等好，所以我们有一个最小化a
inequality ok so we have a minimizing a

90
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,965
很漂亮的功能
very simple function with pretty

91
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,515
简单的约束，但在
straightforward constraints but in

92
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,335
平等约束所以有
equality constraints so there the

93
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,694
而不是这些是这两个在一起
instead of these are these two together

94
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,664
是和它的约束
are the constraints that and it's in

95
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,025
线性规划中的线性代数
linear algebra in linear programming

96
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,775
语言这称为可行集
language this is called the feasible set

97
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:51,395
X这是约束集资本没问题
X it's the constraint set capital okay

98
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,694
在笔记中没错，所以让我画画
and in the notes right ok so let me draw

99
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,944
也许可以在这里展示一张图片
a picture to to show maybe here maybe

100
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:04,835
我只想问你们有多少人
I'll just ask how many of you are

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,025
已经熟悉线性编程
already familiar with linear programming

102
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,615
哦真主好吧所以我不会说明这一点
oh Allah okay so I won't labor the point

103
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,955
但是，让我画一张照片，这样我的
but let me just draw a picture so my

104
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,914
图片就在这里，这就是n
picture will be just here so that's n

105
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,525
等于3所以这是X1X2X3
equals 3 so this is the X 1 X 2 X 3

106
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,974
空格和X大于或等于0表示
space and X greater or equal 0 means

107
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,775
这意味着我在这里
what it means that I'm in this

108
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,375
如果它们是正确的八分之一空间
one-eighth of the space right if they're

109
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,224
非负的井我会说象限
non-negative well I would say Quadrant

110
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,414
但我真的应该说八分之一因为
but I really should say octant because

111
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,065
它是整个3d空间的1/8
it's in there's 1/8 of the full 3d space

112
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,964
所以我在这里，然后也许我有M
so I'm in here and then maybe I have M

113
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:55,465
是
is

114
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,635
也许只是一个约束，所以让
maybe just one constraint like so so let

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,185
我把费用说成X1加2X.
me take the cost to be say X 1 plus 2 X

116
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:12,025
2加5X3说和约束我
2 plus 5 X 3 say and the constraint I'm

117
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,355
只要有一个等式X1加X.
just gonna have one equation X 1 plus X

118
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,585
2让我轻松搞定
2 let me make it easy make that

119
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,975
约束也是一个容易的，所以这是
constraint an easy one too so this is

120
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,295
这就是我们要尽量减少的
the this is what we're going to minimize

121
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,425
这就是我们必须满足的
and that's what we have to satisfy as

122
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,305
以及x等于0，这是一个普通的1
well as x equals 0 so that's a plain 1

123
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,665
等式给出了r3中的一个平面
equation gives us a plane in r3 the

124
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:52,575
飞机会经历什么打击
plane would go through what hits the

125
00:07:52,580 --> 00:08:00,325
轴在300等的最小的
axes at 3 0 0 and so the minimum the

126
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,325
点必须躺在那架飞机上
point has to lie on that plane and it

127
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,725
必须躺在八分圆，以便飞机
has to lie in the octant so that plane

128
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,815
被切成三角形是的
is chopped off to be a triangle yeah

129
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,145
这是线性的良好可视化
this is a good visualization of linear

130
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,085
编程和结论是什么
programming and what's the conclusion

131
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:22,285
我们的成本是线性的，结果是
well our cost is linear so the result is

132
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,925
这三个角落中的一个是
that one of these three corners is the

133
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,575
赢家可能会发生它可能发生
winner it could happen it could happen

134
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,185
也许我对这些有相同的价值
that maybe I have equal values on those

135
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,945
两个角落，因此一路走来
two corners and therefore all the way

136
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,914
也将是赢家但是当我
along would be also winners but when I

137
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,645
有一个线性函数它是最大值
have a linear function it's a maximum at

138
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,645
结束，这些是结束那些
the end and these are the ends those

139
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,035
三个角所以三零零零
three corners so so three zero zero zero

140
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,595
三零或零零三是
three zero or zero zero three are the

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,035
三个角落
three corners

142
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,435
其中一个是赢家和
and one of those is the winner and the

143
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,925
问题实际上已经解决了
problem is solved and forth in fact for

144
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,535
这种情况，因为我猜是最小化
this case since I'm minimizing I guess

145
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,975
这将是角落
it would be that corner that

146
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,394
风，所以让我给它一个明星而不是xy
wind so let me give it a star not an x-y

147
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,465
s-300因为哦，没有那三个所以
s-300 cuz that oh no that three so the

148
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,985
值竟然是三处
value turned out to be three at the

149
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:29,444
第3点将它归零，这是明星还可以
point 3 zeros it and that's a star okay

150
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:34,795
好的好的好的还好什么更多
good good good good okay what what more

151
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,764
我想做什么我说是的应该是的
do I want to do I said yes should it be

152
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:45,985
所以没有零零零三
so no zero zero zero three

153
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,875
哪来的未来三年由三个这是
where's the next three is three that's

154
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,764
罚款给了我们一个机会，我觉得
fine that gives us a chance I think that

155
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,584
会给我这15分的费用
would give me cost of 15 this would give

156
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,235
我的成本是6，这会给我
me a cost of 6 and that would give me

157
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,074
街对面
across the street

158
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,134
是的，如果我们能做到的话
yeah it's obviously if we could

159
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,415
列举我们所有的角落
enumerate all the corners we would have

160
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,415
获得答案的超快速方式
a super fast way to get the answer but

161
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,295
麻烦当然是大的
the trouble is of course that for large

162
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,785
值和M和n的数量
values and an amount of M and n there

163
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,165
是指数多的角落和我们
are exponentially many corners and we

164
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,755
我不想一直看到它们
don't want to see them all so that's

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,155
什么使线性编程需要时间
what makes linear programming take time

166
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,024
对于那里的算法需要创意
and need ideas so for algorithms there

167
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,704
两种类型的算法有两种类型
are two types of algorithms two types of

168
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,274
编码所有这些也是旧的
codes it's all these the older as well

169
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,215
建立的有这样一个方法是
established ones are so one way is the

170
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:56,965
找到角落的单纯形法
simplex method which finds a corner we

171
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,264
知道最优的是其中一个
know the optimum is some one of the

172
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,485
角落所以它可以找到它会找到一个
corners so it can find it'll find one

173
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:09,455
角落，我们将去下一个角落
corner and we'll go to the next corner

174
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,375
所以，如果它开始，如果它开始于其中一个
so if it starts if it starts at one of

175
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,825
它会沿着这些角落行进
these corners it will travel along along

176
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,995
降低成本的优势
an edge that lowers the cost and it has

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,505
最后停止，因为它是线性的
to stop at the end because it's linear

178
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,155
成本将继续下降和下降
the cost will keep going down and going

179
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,265
直到它陷入颠簸
down until it bumps up into bumps into

180
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,945
结束点，然后它不能去
the end point and then it can't go

181
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,945
进一步然后我们将从那个下一个
further and then we would from that next

182
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:43,024
角落我们会去每个角落的下一个角落
corner we would go to a next corner each

183
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,024
时间就像最陡峭的下降
time it's like steepest descent on the

184
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,195
从第一个弯道精读边缘我们
con the edges we from the first corner

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,644
我们走得最陡，直到我们不能去
we go the steepest way till we can't go

186
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,985
我们进一步打了另一个角落，我们
further we've hit another corner and we

187
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,285
然后我们重新计算线性代数
and we recompute a linear algebra find

188
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,625
哪个方向最陡峭
which direction is steepest from there

189
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,985
而且这就是。的想法
and and so that's the idea of the

190
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,365
单纯形法由...发明
simplex method which was invented by

191
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:18,755
跳舞和代数不会去
dancing and and the algebra is not going

192
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,645
在今天的演讲中，但它是
to be in today's lecture but it's

193
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,215
人们必须直截了当
straightforward well people have to

194
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,185
优化它，因为这是一个高度
optimize it because that's a highly

195
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,795
经常使用的方法是的，但是
frequently used method yeah okay but

196
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,045
然后大约20年后或许30年
then about 20 years later maybe or 30 I

197
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,235
记得去市中心的一个讲座
remember going to a lecture in downtown

198
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,454
波士顿由karmarkar所以我必须把他的
Boston by karmarkar so I have to put his

199
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:53,645
命名我们的标记，他在
name down our marker and he was in the

200
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,315
所有的报纸都是纽约时报
New York Times all the newspapers so it

201
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,885
他有另一种选择是一件大事
was a big deal he had an alternative

202
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:08,495
算法和他的确切算法
algorithm and the exact algorithm he he

203
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,265
提议直到今天才存活下来但是
proposed hasn't survived until today but

204
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:17,315
这个想法已经和当时的想法是去
the idea has and the idea was to go to

205
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,605
在可行集内旅行而不是
travel inside the feasible set and not

206
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,015
在边缘
around the edges

207
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,425
所以他的想法因为在这里我们
so his idea because in in in here we

208
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,215
也许在靠近那边开始旅行
maybe travel down near that edge start

209
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,795
再次旅行，所以它最陡峭
again travel again so its steepest

210
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,315
在约束集中的下降
descent in the in the constraint set the

211
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,825
可行集，你可以使用微积分
feasible set and you can use calculus

212
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:48,215
和这个想法所以这就是这个
and and this idea so this is this is

213
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,535
内点法，所以我只会用
interior point methods so I'll just use

214
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,445
内部这个词告诉我们
the word interior that's telling us that

215
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:01,655
我们是我们的可行集内，我们
we're we're inside the feasible set we

216
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,025
不打老远来了
don't hit come all the way to the

217
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,455
故意因为我们想要的边界
boundary intentionally because we want

218
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,275
移动和寻找衍生物的空间
room to move and to find derivatives

219
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,485
空的牛顿的消息最小化
empty whose Newton's message to minimize

220
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,335
你看到你选择一个搜索方向
you see you choose a search Direction

221
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,265
正如所有优化所做的那样
just as all of optimization does and in

222
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,725
搜索方向你跟踪它和
that search Direction you track it and

223
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,205
你碰到之前就会停下来
you come you stop before you bump into

224
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,025
然后是可行集的边缘
the edge of the feasible set and then

225
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,485
你可以再次计算衍生物
you compute derivatives again so you can

226
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,225
使用微积分，这是一种方法
use calculus and it it's a method that

227
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,585
这是一个想法，内部的想法来了
it's an idea that the interior idea came

228
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:43,115
在汽车标记之前，但他超级
before car marker but he got super

229
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,565
宣传，使之真正得到重视了
publicity so it really got attention got

230
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,095
新想法和新想法部分来了
new thinking and new ideas came partly

231
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,975
来自麻省理工学院的人和这两个人
from people at MIT and and these two are

232
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,535
现在仍然没有人参加比赛
now still locked in competition no one

233
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,065
并没有打败对方
hasn't beaten the other in in all

234
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,655
线性编程就是这样的问题
problems so so linear programming is

235
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,715
这里然后进行非线性编程
here but then for nonlinear programming

236
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,025
成本为二次规划
quadratic programming where the cost is

237
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,805
二次非线性规划半
quadratic nonlinear programming semi

238
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,205
明确的编程就是你的所在
definite programming that's where you

239
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,785
有矩阵未知的矩阵
have a matrix unknown a matrix

240
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,005
约束那些更多
constraints those are all the more

241
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,135
复杂的你得到的越多
complicated you get the more it tends to

242
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,545
是
be

243
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,285
内部点方法没关系，这是一个
interior point methods okay that's a

244
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:42,165
线性编程总结我现在
summary of linear programming now I'd

245
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,745
想举个例子然后我
like to give an example and then I

246
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,845
没有告诉你主要的好让我
haven't told you the main well let me

247
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,115
告诉你关于二元性的主要事实
tell you the main fact about duality

248
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,584
好的
okay

249
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:53,715
这是真的，我也许会写
this is really and I'll write that maybe

250
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,954
在这旁边，所以做一个二元性如果
here next to it so do a duality if

251
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,865
有一个双重采购LP和双重
there's a dual procure LP and that dual

252
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,374
将做一个最大值而不是一个
is going to do a maximum instead of a

253
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:16,124
最低和成本是
minimum and the cost is is going to

254
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,175
从原始问题涉及B所以
involve the B from the primal problem so

255
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,305
这现在称为原始问题
this is now called the primal problem

256
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,754
这是它的双重所以有双胞胎
and this is its dual so there are twin

257
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,665
他们使用相同数据的问题但是
problems they use the same data but

258
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,274
完全不同，就像转置一样
quite differently it's like transposing

259
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,035
事情如此让我们称之为未知的Y.
things so so let's call the unknown Y so

260
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:47,204
因为y是右手边
for y to be the right hand side over

261
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:55,235
这里是1M的，这样的最大化
here is M by 1 so that's maximize that

262
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,495
我们受制于什么
we're subject to what are the

263
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,615
约束好成本函数
constraints well the cost function over

264
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,824
这里看到成本向量进入了
here see the cost vector goes into the

265
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:07,605
约束和我认为更大
constraints and I think the greater

266
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,485
等号因为明显变得少了
equal sign because obably becomes a less

267
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,034
或等于签名a得到调换我
or equal to sign the a gets transposed I

268
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,044
认为这可能是
think that's probably probably the

269
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,944
双重约束，它发生了
constraint in the dual and it happens it

270
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,255
不需要Y我们没有更大的y
doesn't need Y we don't have y greater

271
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,404
在这里等于0确定这是一个双重
equal 0 over here ok so that's a dual

272
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:32,255
它有一个线性成本的问题
problem it has a linear cost it has

273
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,225
它可以是线性不等式约束
linear inequality constraints it can be

274
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,775
你可以通过单纯形法解决
solved by the simplex method you could

275
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,575
选择你是解决那一个还是
choose whether you solve that one or

276
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,424
这个因为如果你解决了一个你
this one because if you solve one you

277
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,815
解决另一个
solve the other

278
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,275
两者紧密相连，那就是
the two are closely connected and that's

279
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,725
二元性的关键理念也许我会
the key idea of duality so maybe I'll

280
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,165
把想法首先是小麦的
put the idea first of all of wheat

281
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:05,665
二元性，说这个
duality which says that the this

282
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,565
我们试图最大限度地量
quantity that we're trying to maximize

283
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,015
我们得到它尽可能大的
we're getting it as large as possible is

284
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,925
总是少于等于任何C的
always less lesser equal to any C

285
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,395
转X这是任何这是
transpose X this is for for any this is

286
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,445
任何可行的任何可以任何任何可以
for any feasible allowed any can any any

287
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,625
满足的X＆Y
X&Y that are that satisfy the

288
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,635
约束记住可行的手段
constraints remember feasible means

289
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,785
在其他方面满足约束
satisfies the constraint so in other

290
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,885
言语这个问题这个最大化
words this problem this maximization

291
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,305
你试图推动它的问题
problem you're trying to push this up

292
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,925
你正在尝试的最小化问题
the minimization problem you're trying

293
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,165
把它拉下来很容易显示出来
to pull this down and it's easy to show

294
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,005
B转置它的那个很容易
that the one that B transpose it's easy

295
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,485
表明不平等让我们这样做
to show that inequality let's do that so

296
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:00,185
B转置Ytrue应该是一行
B transpose Y true should be a one-line

297
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:07,835
证明所以B转置Yok我该怎么做
proof so B transpose Y ok what do I do

298
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,765
所以B转置Y好我在这里看看
so B transpose Y well I look over here

299
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,825
那就是B出现的那个X.
that's where B shows up that's X

300
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:22,565
将转置Y转置为右，因为B
transpose a transpose Y right because B

301
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,935
是斧头
is ax

302
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,605
我是可行的所以我的B是X和任何人
I'm feasible so my B is a X and for any

303
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,565
X，这是因为这是任何X是b
X this is for this is for any X that B

304
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,995
会是斧头所以我到目前为止都很好
is going to be ax so am I good so far

305
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,765
现在我该怎么办，但现在我看这里
and now what do I do but now I look here

306
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,545
我看到一个转座Y坐在里面
I see a transpose Y sitting right in

307
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,045
在我面前所以我说得好，除非或
front of me so I say well ok unless or

308
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,195
等于，我想我已经完成了
equal to and I guess I'm done a

309
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,055
转换明智少于或等于C所以我
transpose wise less or equal to C so I

310
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,925
有X转置CC转置X.
have X transpose C C transpose X

311
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,255
如此平等，等于这个更少或
so so equal this equals this less or

312
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,995
等于我的弱二元性是
equal that I've got it weak duality is

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,735
只是把要求放在一起
just put together the the requirements

314
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,885
在x和y上，你有它但是说出来
on x and y and you have it but word it

315
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,625
这是重要的，你知道如果
was this important you know if the

316
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,635
数学是对一切都已经
mathematics is right everything has to

317
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,175
请它发挥它的作用等等
have it please play its role and so

318
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,575
什么是X的作用大于等于零
what's the role of X greater equal zero

319
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,345
如果我们只是偶数，为什么我们需要X.
there why do we need X if we just even

320
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,545
想到一个平等的只是数字Y.
think of an equal one just a number Y

321
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,365
我们在哪里使用X的事实
where do we use the fact that X is

322
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,735
大于或等于0我们是否使用它
greater or equal 0 do we do we use it

323
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,415
这看起来如此顺利，因为a
this looks so so smooth because a

324
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:55,295
转置Y我会记下X
transpose Y I'll write down as X

325
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,375
转移C只是为了这一刻
transpose C for the moment just just so

326
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,455
你的眼睛说同样的X转置和
your eye says the same X transpose and

327
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,915
a转置Y小于C
the a transpose Y is lesser equals C

328
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,895
其中X大于等于零
where is X greater equal zero coming in

329
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,205
是
yes

330
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,695
是的，这是真的，但我想看到
yeah that's true but but I want to see

331
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,165
是的，所以这是我的观点，事实
yeah so here's my point that the fact

332
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,295
转置Y小于C
that a transpose Y is lesser equals C

333
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,345
这非常重要，但如果是X.
that's fine highly important but if X

334
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,155
是消极的，这将是另一种方式
was negative it would be the other way

335
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,595
你会想到另一种方式吗？
you would you would get the other way

336
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,875
你不会得到你想要什么，所以
and you wouldn't have what you want so

337
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,095
我们确实使用了X的事实
we really do use the fact that X is

338
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,845
如果我有，则等于零
greater equals zero to say that I have

339
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,735
国家等于这个然后我成倍增加
national equal this and then I multiply

340
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,065
通过积极的东西，然后我仍然
by something positive and then I still

341
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,835
我们没那么好，所以每一个都是
have less we okay good so every it's the

342
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,595
数学是对的，一切都发挥了作用
math is right everything does its part

343
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,955
然后当然是美丽的
and then the of course the beautiful

344
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,745
结果重要的结果是
result the important result is that

345
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,135
刚刚被称为强烈的二元性
there's strong duality just called

346
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,935
现在最大的二元性
duality which is that at the maximum now

347
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,665
这不是任何x和y，但这是
this is not for any x and y but this is

348
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,285
因为这将是4倍
for this is going to be 4x

349
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,615
为什么明星赢家和X明星
why star the winner and X star the

350
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,125
赢家平等等等，这是我们的
winner equality holds so that's to our

351
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,585
双重问题中的最大值是
the maximum in the dual problem is the

352
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,105
与原始的最小值相同
same as the minimum in the primal

353
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,225
问题二见过没有
problem the two have met there is no

354
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:35,715
一些非线性的二元差距
duality gap in some cooked up nonlinear

355
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,675
问题可能存在差距
problems there could be a gap between

356
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,095
最大和最小但你希望
the maximum and the minimum but you hope

357
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,285
不是，这里的大定理不是
not and here this the big theorem is not

358
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,295
你把这个推出去是件有问题的
there equal a matter you push this out

359
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,075
推下去，这是另一种方式
push that down so that's another way to

360
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,995
说二元性就是这就是我
say that duality is that this is I'm

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,335
我可以把它推到某个地图上
pushing that up at some map I could

362
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,145
将其写为最小值
write that as a maximum of a minimum

363
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,265
如果我等于最小值
equaling a minimum of a maximum if I

364
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:15,285
想要它是线性的二元性
wanted so it's the duality in linear

365
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,805
编程和一个女人一样
programming was the same as one woman's

366
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,035
极小极大定理及其定理应用
minimax theorem and his theorem applied

367
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,685
对于双人游戏而言，关键是凯夫
to two-person games so the kief the key

368
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:32,505
数学的结果是，这是偶
math result is that that is duality for

369
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,115
线性编程，它会
linear programming and it's gonna be

370
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,585
你会看到同样的事情发生
you'll see the same thing happening for

371
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,555
双人游戏，这是一个极小的动画
two-person games and it's a minimax

372
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,325
定理或鞍点或它只是
theorem or a saddle point or it's just

373
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,975
事情出来是的，是的，所以只是为了
things come out right yep yep so just to

374
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:58,545
提到数学编程
mention that mathematical programming of

375
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,655
课程包括更加困难
course includes much more difficult

376
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,955
这是线性编程的问题
problems this is linear programming that

377
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,535
你看到的问题是一个美丽的问题
problem as you see is as a beautiful

378
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:15,105
简单的理论和关注
simple theory and the paying attention

379
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,995
正在关注算法
is paying attention to the algorithm

380
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,305
因为你有两个重要的选择
because you've got two important choices

381
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,175
他们都得到了高度发达
and they both get highly developed

382
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,115
现在好了，所以对于游戏现在我要转
now okay so for game now I'm gonna turn

383
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,395
我会做一个最大流量的例子
to well I'll do a example of max flow

384
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,655
等于最小切割看什么，然后去
equal min cut to see what and then go to

385
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,255
两个人的比赛，所以这里是一个
two two person game so here's a here's

386
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:50,865
一个例子
an example

387
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,245
好吧所以我从一个图表开始是的，让我
okay so I start with a graph yeah let me

388
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:09,715
只是如此，这是这是源
just so this is the source this is the

389
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,245
下沉，我正在通过
sink and I'm sending flow through the

390
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,155
网络所以我是一个网络
network so it's a network that I'm

391
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,755
发送流量，所以我的工作就是这样
sending flow through so I'm so my job is

392
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:26,215
最大化是的，我将X设置为
to maximize yeah is to I'll set X at the

393
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:34,105
源是零，然后流
source to be zero and then the flow the

394
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,295
总流量会进入水槽所以我
total flow will come into the sink so I

395
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:42,805
想要在水槽中最大化X，这样就可以了
want to maximize X at the sink so it's

396
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,215
线性规划及其应用
of linear programming and their

397
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,725
约束那么约束是什么
constraint so what are the constraints

398
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,845
每个Edge都有容量让我们看看
every Edge has a capacity so let's see

399
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:57,745
假设Edge有容量5让我
suppose that Edge has capacity 5 let me

400
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,885
让我把能力放在所有这些边缘上
let me put capacities on all these edges

401
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:17,775
2134我只是在这里刺伤
2 1 3 4 I'm just stabbing around here

402
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,575
让我说-好吧我不知道是什么
let me say - ok I have no idea what's

403
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,735
发生在这里
happening here

404
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,045
但如果我们可能会看到问题
but if we see the problem we'll probably

405
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,765
能够解决这些问题
be able to solve it so so these

406
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,654
约束是流量变量
constraints are that the flow variable

407
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,544
这将是为什么
which would be would be the why that

408
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,504
在那里我试图最大化无法
where I'm trying to maximize cannot to

409
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,335
普通的流量
the amount of flow just in ordinary

410
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,914
单词边缘的流量
words the amount of flow on the edges

411
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,294
不能高于容量
can't go go higher than the capacity

412
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,904
我可以沿着这条边发送十一个但是
I could send eleven along this edge but

413
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:55,644
然后我无处可去
then I've got nowhere to send it after

414
00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:00,085
我可以在发送以及九百
that I could send well nine hundred on

415
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,544
那边缘但显然会得到
that edge but obviously it would get

416
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:06,144
卡在那里所以问题是什么
stuck there so the question is what's

417
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:10,494
我可以发送的最大值
the maximum I can send through that

418
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:16,344
网络这是一个经典的问题和
network it's a classical problem and and

419
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:19,195
事实上，这是一个整数编程
in fact it's it's an integer programming

420
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,654
问题我这些都是整数
problem I these are all integer

421
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,715
容量我可以坚持整数
capacities I could insist on integer

422
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,044
流动，但它是一个非常显着的整数
flows but it's a very remarkable integer

423
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:36,205
问题，因为我可以允许分数
problem because I could allow fractions

424
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,124
答案不会是不会
and the answer would not be it would not

425
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:41,455
涉及换句话说分数，如果我
involve fractions in other words if I

426
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,744
把它作为一个整数的问题，则
keep it as an integer problem then the

427
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,154
数学是用于较硬的绝对
mathematics is definitely harder for an

428
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,514
整数问题有什么不同所以
integer problem what's different so so

429
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,065
x可以是整数，也可以是整数
the x's could be integers or they could

430
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:08,335
是真正的实数，在这里他们
be real real numbers over here they were

431
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,234
实数我碰巧得到一个整数
real numbers I happen to get an integer

432
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:15,624
为此，如果我放了，如果我有10
for this but if I put if I had 10

433
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:20,634
跨越15维的飞机和
crossing planes in 15 dimensions and the

434
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:24,624
整数将完全丢失，但是
integers would be totally lost but the

435
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:28,104
点在这里，如果我允许真实
point is here that if I allow real

436
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:34,825
数字它不会让我更多的流量
numbers it doesn't get me any more flow

437
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,854
获胜流量是整数
that the winning flow is an integer

438
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,065
无论如何，这是一个整数问题
anyway so it's an integer problem which

439
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,004
可以安全放松，你可以安全
can be safely relaxed and you can safely

440
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,695
使用单纯形法或汽车标记法
use simplex method or car markers method

441
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,185
或者在内点法
or in the interior point method

442
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,175
与非整数，因为在
with with non integers because in the

443
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,025
这里的内部你没有结束它
interior here you're not ending it

444
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,395
你可以在整数开始或结束
starting or ending at integers you can

445
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,405
这样做是因为整数答案
do it because the the integer answer

446
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,675
最终会更好还是什么
will be in the end better okay and what

447
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,695
是那个答案
is that answer

448
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,025
我认为我已经具备了这些能力
III think I've made those capacities

449
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,475
像太容易太
like too easy too

450
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:24,685
哦，我没有这样做，所以应该做什么
oh I didn't do this one so so what shall

451
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,445
我这么说，我就像九岁一样大
I say so I make it large like nine I

452
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,115
不知道什么是最好的
don't know okay what's the best we can

453
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:39,705
通过该网络做到这一点
do through that through that Network

454
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,865
好吧，我从这里看不到它是什么
okay I can't see it from here yet what

455
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,965
我该怎么办
what should I do

456
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,365
显然在这个简单的问题中我可以
obviously in this simple problem I can

457
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,855
得到任何我想要非常本
get anything I want pretty much to this

458
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,645
到目前为止，但我能做些什么
that far but then what can I do

459
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:05,305
让我，让我甚至做出19好了，
let me let me even make that 19 okay so

460
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:09,265
我不是在施加太多限制
I'm I'm not imposing much of a limit on

461
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,635
那边但是这些边缘都是
that edge either but these edges are

462
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,825
非常严格的限制，这些都是
quite tight limits and these are sort of

463
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,345
中间限制你好吗？
intermediate limits well what do you

464
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:21,165
认为是我能发送的最多
think is the most I could send through

465
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,205
你怎么能告诉我我的意思
and how would you show me that I

466
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,575
无法发送更多关键
couldn't send more that's the key

467
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,735
问题我想得到一个约束
question I want to get a bound on an

468
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,065
这个最大值的上限就是这个上限
upper bound on this maximum this maximum

469
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,525
进入水槽的次数少或相等
getting into the sink is less or equal

470
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,075
到什么什么号码，你会
to and what what number would you

471
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,615
建议我可以通过我获得一千
propose could I get a thousand through I

472
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,905
可以开始，但我当然不会
could start but of course I I wouldn't

473
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,785
在那里平铺我无法进一步
tile up there I couldn't get further

474
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,435
你觉得我最擅长什么？
what do you what do you think the best I

475
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,065
可以做
can do

476
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,725
十，我不能做十多怎么样
ten I can't do more than ten how how

477
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:13,895
我可以做十二十二十二这个权利
could I do ten twelve twelve this right

478
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,445
所以我看到他这样，才能这样啊
so I I see him that way can this yeah

479
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,785
绝对你可以分裂然后这个
absolutely you can split and then this

480
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,725
这可以到这里，那会是
can this go here and that would would be

481
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,505
能够去那里我可以得到十
able to go there so I can get ten

482
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:30,765
我能做得更好吗？
correct can I do anything better

483
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,375
哦，我可以用这种方式发送一些东西
oh I could be sending some up this way

484
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,825
同时我可以得到三个
at the same time so I could get three

485
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,965
在顶部
along the top

486
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,205
我可以这样就像拍卖一样好
I could so this is like an auction okay

487
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,985
我们可以得到13分
we can get up to 13 can we get so that

488
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,555
这是三个这样的方式和十个
that was three going this way and ten

489
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:56,355
走这条路是13，我不能
going this way is 13 and can I not

490
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:04,575
超过13我听到40是啊我有
exceed 13 do I hear 40 yeah oh I've got

491
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,225
一个很大的空间多了一个
a lot of room for one more

492
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,085
好的，所以14很多孩子，我也好
so okay so 14 many kids alright do I

493
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:17,835
听到15如果我做了12然后我会做什么
hear 15 if I did 12 then what would I do

494
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,135
我把两个送到这里好吧我要做什么
I send two up here okay what am I gonna

495
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,125
从这里与他们一起发送他们
do with them from here send them up

496
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,725
再一次，然后现在你呢
again and along but then now you then

497
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,835
我现在拥有的三个是什么
the three that that I had right now what

498
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:46,995
将是一个问题的回归，我
would be back of one problem and I'm

499
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,785
寻找知道什么时候退出的必然
looking for a bound to know when to quit

500
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,395
要知道我什么时候优化了那个
to know when I've optimized that's the

501
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,705
二元性的整体观念是找到一些
whole idea of duality is to find some

502
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,695
我想要推倒的最重要的事情
upper thing that I'm trying to push down

503
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,005
但我不能超越它，所以我
and but I can't go beyond it so so I

504
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,095
不要以为我能得到更多
don't think I could get more than to see

505
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,195
一切都必须穿过这个中间
everything has to cross this middle so

506
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,565
三，四夜我不认为我
three and four night I don't think I

507
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:11,835
可以
could

508
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,515
B23有人说24比23我
b23 somebody said 24 more than 23 I

509
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,674
会因为我而非常怀疑
would be very doubtful because I

510
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,154
无法穿越中间但是
couldn't get it across the middle but

511
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,154
然后我可以得到23我怀疑它
then can I get 23 I doubt it

512
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,145
也许最好可能14，那怎么会
maybe 14 as best possible so how would

513
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:35,715
我们表明，14是最好的，我认为
we show that 14 is best possible I think

514
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,284
如果我能找到这个就叫做
if I could find so this is called the

515
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:43,635
切这个削减在这个网络中，从而
cut a cut in this in this network so

516
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:50,385
是的，我看到像你那样的剪裁
yeah I see a cut a cut like there you

517
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:56,115
看到流量的每一点都有
see that every bit of flow has got to

518
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,274
交叉切割和总容量
cross that cut and the total capacity

519
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,255
穿越是3和1和2
crossing is the 3 and the 1 and the 2

520
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,125
和8这是14所以我无法得到
and the 8 which is 14 so I can't get

521
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,945
超过14通过不知何故
more than 14 through and somehow that

522
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,924
切割装载到容量可能那些
cut is loaded to capacity probably those

523
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,305
所有边缘都必须做到完全
edges all all have to be fully up to

524
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,104
那么容量就越过了切口
capacity then that crossed the cut so so

525
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:27,225
切割是边缘的分离
the cut is is a separation of edges that

526
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,884
选择一个源和对不起的节点
go with a source and sorry nodes that go

527
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,715
与此去一个源节点
with a source nodes that go with this

528
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,174
事情是的，然后它是边缘
thing yeah and and then it's the edges

529
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:43,364
越过切口所以我是的，没关系
across the cut so I yeah is that okay

530
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:47,685
对于一个例子，这样的二元性的
for an example so that's the duality the

531
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,914
最大流量竟然是14和
maximum flow turned out to be 14 and the

532
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,404
最小切割结果是14和什么时候
minimum cut turned out to be 14 and when

533
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,685
那些匹配14等于14我知道我
those matched 14 equal 14 I know I'm

534
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,175
通过我知道我通过因为我
through I know I'm through because I'm

535
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,035
能够通过14而我永远不会
able to get 14 through and I could never

536
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,135
得到更多是的3＆4＆6＆8是啊好的
get more yeah 3 & 4 & 6 & 8 yeah okay

537
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,495
当然还有一个大网络
and of course the in a big network

538
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,614
切割是最大的切割不去
the cut is the maximum cut is not going

539
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:16,355
很好看，你不知道
to be visible well you couldn't you know

540
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,425
他们会有数以千计的优势
they would have thousands of edges you

541
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,275
看不到你在做什么，但是
couldn't see what you were doing but but

542
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,785
你可以快速解决这个问题
you could solve this problem fast

543
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,815
实际上很快，而且这很重要
actually fast and and it's an important

544
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,965
在实践中，这是一个重要的例子
in practice it's an important example a

545
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,485
很多其他东西都适合
lot of other things fit into the

546
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,355
max-flowmin-cut示例，因此
max-flow min-cut example and therefore

547
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,625
解决它比我没有更快哦
solving it in faster than oh I didn't

548
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,285
甚至说速度
even say about speed

549
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:47,225
所以单纯形法几乎总是如此
so the simplex method almost always its

550
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,245
一般情况书房斯皮尔曼谁在
average case den Spielman who was on the

551
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,155
这里的教职员工非常棒
faculty here who's just terrific in this

552
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,665
该地区可能是最先研究的地区之一
area was maybe among the first to study

553
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:04,145
平均情况也是如此
the average case so so for a for an

554
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:09,185
取而代之的是a和B和C的平均选择
average choice of a and B and C instead

555
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,585
做出最糟糕的选择
of making the worst choice for the worst

556
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,885
选择你可以创建一个可行的集合
choice you can create a feasible set

557
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,685
它必须去角落角落
that it has to go corner Corner corner

558
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,185
角落直到结束所以
corner until to get to the end so the

559
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,825
单纯形法将呈指数级增长
simplex method would take exponentially

560
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,425
但是这种情况非常罕见
long but that's extremely rare doesn't

561
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:31,625
在实践中发生我认为和
happen in practice I think and the

562
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,295
平均值是多项式，所以它很快
average one is polynomial so it's a fast

563
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:41,165
方法平均这个，但我们可以
method on average this but and we can

564
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,625
显然这是一个着名的结果
show actually that was a famous result

565
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,375
它来自俄罗斯那个线性的
it came from Russia that that linear

566
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,295
编程是在P和LP之间进行的
programming is in the big P versus LP

567
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,985
世界线性规划与P一致
world linear programming goes with P

568
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,015
线性规划是一个可以解决的问题
linear programming is a problem that can

569
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,135
在多项式时间内求解单纯形
be solved in polynomial time the simplex

570
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,775
方法不会总是这样，但它可以
method won't always do it but it can be

571
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,765
做了耶和华来到这个世界
done yeah there came into the world

572
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,045
椭球方法，有一个
ellipsoid methods and there was a

573
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,005
激动人心的时间来决定线性
exciting time to decide that linear

574
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,415
编程实际上是P而不是LP
programming was actually P and not LP

575
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,275
是的好，所以这是一个案例
yep okay so that's okay this is a case

576
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,005
您可以理解的二元性
of duality where you can understand

577
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,155
你可以通过国家购买这种二元性
duality you can buy this by the state

578
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,945
流量不能超过容量
that the flow can't exceed the capacity

579
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,385
削减，所以这是什么二元性
of the cut so that's what duality is any

580
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:44,915
它必须要少于Rico的容量
flow it has to be less Rico the capacity

581
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:54,455
任何削减他们的能力是总和
of any cut their capacity being the sum

582
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,754
在一个如此当然也有其他
of the one so of course there are other

583
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:01,504
那截切，必须传中，但是
cuts that cut has to be crossed but

584
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:04,024
这是三七十二十二
that's got three seven fourteen twenty

585
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:07,745
两个容量，所以它的十四个容量
two capacity so it the fourteen capacity

586
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,915
这是最小的，我给了
was the was the minimum and I gave the

587
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,985
最大不错是不是很好
maximum nice isn't that nice

588
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,354
是啊好了，还有另外一个世界在这里
yeah okay so there's another world here

589
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,584
也有两人游戏
of two person games that also has

590
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:26,584
二元性，可以表达，所以让我
duality and could be expressed so let me

591
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:31,175
今天终于谈谈了两个人
just talk finally today about two-person

592
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,385
所以这两个人都是X＆Y
game so the two persons are X&Y of

593
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,844
当然还有其他很好的名字
course what other names good they have

594
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:43,774
并且有一个矩阵参与其中
and there's a there's a matrix involved

595
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:52,324
这是支付矩阵，所以让我来看看
this is the payoff matrix so let me take

596
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:58,354
一个非常简单的游戏，所以X正在进行
a very simple game first so X is going

597
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:02,314
选择其中一行，Y是
to choose one of these rows and Y is

598
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,715
要选择其中一列和
going to choose one of these columns and

599
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:12,425
让我们说从x到y的收益我喜欢它
let's say payoff from x to y I like it

600
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,895
这种方式因为这样X，其疼痛是
that way because then X whose pain is is

601
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,314
随着X在这里，最小化
going to be minimizing as X was up here

602
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:24,395
和谁收集的将是
and y who's collecting is going to be

603
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,415
最大化，如在双重所以所以
maximizing as in the dual so so the

604
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,435
好的让我看看我想也许就是一个
payoff well let's see I think maybe one

605
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,104
四到八个可能是一个
four to eight would be a probably a

606
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:40,175
相当容易的游戏玩，这样所以很
fairly easy game to play so that so it's

607
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,495
两人游戏零和游戏
a two-person game zero-sum games

608
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:55,135
一些意味着所有人都付出了什么
some means that means all all pay what

609
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:02,844
前付款是为什么为什么得到所有前任
ex pays goes to why why gets all that ex

610
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:07,975
这里没有第三方没有
pace there's no third party here no

611
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,465
涉及的律师还好，所以会和
lawyers involved okay so what would and

612
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,915
为什么要选择一个列而X是
why is going to choose a column and X is

613
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,915
要选择一个X想要的行
going to choose a row an X wants to make

614
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,515
它很小，Y想要大做好
it small and Y wants to make it big okay

615
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,435
那么这场比赛会发生什么
so what happens in this game

616
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,344
你选择做什么让它变大呢？
what does y choose to make it big the

617
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:31,195
第二列X选择做什么
second column what does X choose to make

618
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,425
它排在第一排，所以它会是
it small the first row so it's gonna be

619
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,055
如果Y保持，那么也要关注它
focus in on that too because if Y keeps

620
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,045
选择第二列是最好的
choosing that column two is the best the

621
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,235
至少是X将不得不支付
least that X is going to have to pay to

622
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,795
他通过选择而实现了这一目标
and he achieves that by choosing the

623
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,094
第一排所以这是一个简单的游戏
first row so it's a simple game that's a

624
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,864
鞍点它是y的最小值
saddle point it's a it's a minimum for y

625
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:00,594
在它的列中，它是X的最大值
in its column and it's a maximum for X

626
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,555
在它的行，但当然是矩阵和
in its row but of course a matrix and

627
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,435
其他矩阵可能没有这样的
other matrix might not have such a

628
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,745
马鞍点，所以你可以看到没关系
saddle point so that may do you see okay

629
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,915
本场比赛，这将是一个排序的
with this game that would be a sort of

630
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,195
直截了当的游戏简单
straightforward game where simple

631
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,795
策略第二列每次第一行
strategy column two every time row one

632
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,975
每一次都是最佳的，但现在让我
every time is the optimal but now let me

633
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,795
只是交换那个
just exchange that

634
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,075
所以再次x1和x2y1和y2或他们的
so again x1 and x2 y1 and y2 or their

635
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,775
两列现在发生了什么
two column what happens now

636
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,785
以及为什么有点喜欢大数字
well why kind of likes the big number

637
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:48,515
八，那么第二个
eight there so goes for the second

638
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,435
第二列仍然有更大的
second column still has the bigger

639
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,365
因此Y的目标是第二列
numbers so Y aims for column two

640
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:59,345
但那么X做什么行做x
but then what does X do what row does x

641
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,115
选择y是否在列中
choose if y is in there column to the

642
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:09,125
第二个没关系，所以我找到了一个马鞍
second okay so so have I found a saddle

643
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,485
Y选择此列X的点
point where Y chooses this column X

644
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,015
选择这一行是一个马鞍点
chooses this row is that a saddle point

645
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,795
不，因为现在他会做什么，他看到了X.
no because what will Y do now he sees X

646
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,005
一直选择第二行并且
choosing the second row all the time and

647
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,545
为什么看到了在四非常诱人
why sees a four very tempting for in

648
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,475
该行桑尼是要选择y一个
that row so Y is going to choose y one

649
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,345
第一列通常不是全部
the first column pretty often not all

650
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,985
时间，因为如果他只是发生了什么
the time because what happens if he just

651
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,825
如果Y选择该列的所有时间
if Y chooses this column all the time

652
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,795
那么X会选择这一行而只有
then X will choose this row and only the

653
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,975
收益只会是一个事情
payoff will only be one so that things

654
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,785
为什么他们如此如此，他们走下坡路
went downhill for why they're so so this

655
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:59,845
不是一个鞍点，我们做什么
is not a saddle point and what do we do

656
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,105
混合策略这就是我们选择的原因
mixed strategy which is why we'll choose

657
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:08,705
两列有一些概率
the two columns with some probabilities

658
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,965
添加到一个
that add to one

659
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,745
所以BIA所以有第三个
so so the BIA so there be a third

660
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:20,015
px1和one抱歉的可能性
possibility that px 1 and one I'm sorry

661
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:25,775
py1P乘以此列，1减去P.
py 1 P times this column and 1 minus P

662
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,435
乘以第二列，这样就是P.
times the second column so that'll be P

663
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:38,085
加1减去P乘以8和4p加
plus 1 minus P times 8 and 4p plus

664
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,865
一减去P乘以两次就是这个
one minus P times two that's that's this

665
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:48,635
通过混合他的策略混合列
mixed column by by mixing his strategy

666
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,095
为什么我们有一个像第三个战略
why we have a strategy like a third

667
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:59,895
人为什么三，当然是X
person why three and of course the X is

668
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,435
一段时间后会注意到什么
going to notice after a while what what

669
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,925
这是一个开放的策略
what the strategy is this is an open

670
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,785
竞争你，你没有隐藏
competition you you're not hiding

671
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,125
他们无法掩饰你的任何东西
they're not able to hide anything you

672
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,825
可能会很好，也许Y会跳来跳去
might take well maybe Y will jump around

673
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:21,255
但那是愚蠢的Y即将结束
but that's foolishness Y is going to end

674
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,725
找到P之间的最佳选择
up finding the best choice of P between

675
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,785
0和1
0 & 1

676
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,785
它实际上在0和1之间
and it will actually be between 0 & 1

677
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:36,225
因为列的极端策略
because the extreme strategies of column

678
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,885
1和第2列没有或没有获胜者
1 and column 2 didn't or not winners but

679
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,975
现在X将要做同样的事情PX
now X is going to do the same thing P X

680
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,925
1他要去，他或她将要
1 he's gonna he or she is going to

681
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:54,585
将这些行组合起来，这样就可以了
combine those rows so so this would be P

682
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:00,705
1为第一排，1对不起P哦我
1 for the first row and 1 sorry P oh I

683
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:03,495
更好地选择另一个数字是什么呃
better choose another number what's uh

684
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:10,925
什么是另一封信而不是PQ好的Q.
what's another letter than P Q okay Q

685
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,925
好的
okay

686
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,215
所以这个角色是一个组合
so so this role was a combination of

687
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,925
那些行所以它是Q加一减去Q.
those rows so it's Q plus one minus Q

688
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:27,385
次4在第一位置和
times four in the first position and

689
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:33,175
8加P倍8和1减P
eight plus P times 8 and 1 minus the P

690
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,975
和Q乘以82乘8和1减去Q.
and Q times 8 2 times 8 and 1 minus Q

691
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,355
次2
times 2

692
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,815
对不起，我也写过这个
I'm sorry that I've written this too

693
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:49,545
小但但会发生什么
small but but what's going to happen

694
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,575
什么将决定P和Q和
what's going to determine P and Q and

695
00:45:52,580 --> 00:46:00,045
如果这些是平等的，那就很好地解决游戏
solve the game well if these are equal

696
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:07,405
然后会发生什么然后X没关系
then what happens then X is okay with

697
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:11,545
要么一个人没有X就没有了
either one doesn't X has nothing to

698
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,055
选择是否相等而Y是
choose if those are equal and and Y is

699
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,965
坚持这种混合策略
staying with this mixed strategy which

700
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:22,165
给了他第三个组合专栏
gives him this third combination column

701
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,735
那么X很好，现在你可能会说得好
then X is good now you might say well

702
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,875
然后X会做它想要的但是X.
then X would do what it wanted but X

703
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,785
如果X没有，它就无法做到它想要的东西
couldn't do what it wanted if X doesn't

704
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,945
坚持X的最佳策略Q.
stick with the optimal strategy Q for X

705
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,855
然后你会利用你的优势
then Y will take advantage so that you

706
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,055
真的，这场比赛已经结束了
really the game settles down to once so

707
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,805
所以这应该是平等的，所以当了
so these should be equal so when the

708
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,815
当那些是平等的，我得到什么IP
when those are equal what do I get IP it

709
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,295
看起来我有8减7p
looks like I have 8 minus minus 7p there

710
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,115
对于第一个，在这里我有对于P
for the first one and here I have for P

711
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,095
减2P是2P加1我得到了
minus 2 P is 2 P plus 1 did I get that

712
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:11,285
可能是的
possibly right

713
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:16,055
-对于P-2P是达到峰值并始终
- for P - 2 P is the to peak and always

714
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:20,435
-是啊好了，这些都是平等的，
- yeah okay so those are equal and that

715
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:29,435
告诉我9p是6而P是2/3所以
tells me that 9p is 6 and P is 2/3 so

716
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,525
原来那是最好的策略
that turned out that the best strategy

717
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:37,415
因为y是第一列的2/3
for y is 2/3 on the first column which

718
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,135
看起来不那么有希望和1/3
didn't look so promising and 1/3 on the

719
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:45,425
第二，通过创造它
second and by that by creating that

720
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,065
策略这些数字是什么来的
strategy what what do these numbers come

721
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,535
出去，他们应该来
out to be and they're supposed to come

722
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,665
对于PPlus来说是相同的，所以4次2/3
out equal so for P Plus so 4 times 2/3

723
00:47:54,670 --> 00:48:01,085
是8/3加1减去P是1/3x加2/3
is 8/3 plus 1 minus P is 1/3 x plus 2/3

724
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,475
是十分之三，所以我认为这是十
is 10 thirds so I think that this is ten

725
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,015
三分之一，如果不是三分之一
thirds and if that one isn't ten thirds

726
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:13,225
我很惊讶所以它是2/3
I'm very surprised so it's 2/3

727
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:25,445
对P-P来说是好的，是的告诉我
well is it for P - P yeah tell me

728
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:28,775
我把它们设置得相同，它们是一样的
they're the same did I set them equal

729
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,965
是的，我把它们等于找到和平
yeah I set them equal to find peace so

730
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,665
他们必须是相同的，除了
they have to be the same except for

731
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,435
教练的错误，从来没有发生过
instructor mistakes which never happened

732
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,985
好的，那些应该是平等的
ok so those are those should be equal

733
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:45,905
然后X别无选择哦无路可做
then X has no choice oh no way to do

734
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,485
最好选择他的这些专栏
better choose these columns that he

735
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,375
不能选择那些列免费的那些
can't choose those columns free those

736
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,945
因为Y可以自由行驶
roads freely because Y could take

737
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:56,735
除非如此，否则这将说明这一点
advantage unless so this would tell this

738
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,575
将为q4提供最佳策略
would give the best strategy for q4 for

739
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,295
对不起，对于X是最好的q4
the sorry the best q4 for X yep

740
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,795
是的，你现在看到那张照片吗？
yes do you see that picture now there

741
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,825
可能是其他可能更大
could be other it could be a much bigger

742
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,045
矩阵当然可能还有其他
matrix of course there could be other

743
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:18,935
列假设有一个00列
columns suppose there was a 0 0 column

744
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,455
会产生什么影响
what difference what would be the effect

745
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,135
关于如何实现的最优策略
on the optimal strategy of how

746
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,835
附加列，附加选项
additional column that additional option

747
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:32,295
为Y3好，他不会好走这样
for y3 well he wouldn't take okay so

748
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,285
让我们更加诱人101010
let's make it more tempting 10 10 10

749
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,545
好的
okay

750
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,685
哦，他不会告诉你，是的，是的
oh he wouldn't tell you that right yeah

751

肯定有可能
there certainly could be there could be

754
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,285
该行是X的列或行说
rows that are columns or rows for X that

755
00:49:57,290 --> 00:50:00,345
不要进入混合状态以获得最佳效果

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,655
选择此列选择该行，但
choose this column choose this row but

760
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,045
某些列可能没有或行可能
some some columns may not or rows may

761
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,165
没有出现在最好的混合物中，所以我会
not show up in the best mixture so I'll

762
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,185
我不会完成这一部分让喜欢
I won't complete that partial so like

763
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:28,515
那没关系，那么我们怎么看你呢
that okay so what do we do you see that

764
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,635
我们首先得到一个二元定理
we have a duality theorem we first of

765
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,925
所有你能把它写成线性的
all you could write that as a linear

766
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:38,775

program the unknown is P for X you know

767
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,325

for y the unknown is Q for X so actually

768
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,905
只有一个未知的简单
just have one unknown in this simple

769
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:52,355
问题，但对于这个小问题，但
problem but for this small problem but

770
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,185
你有一个最小化和最大化
you have a minimization and maximization

771
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:01,875
他们在最佳和双重性上相遇
they meet at the optimum and the duality

772
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,735
定理成为for的定理
theorem becomes the the theorem for for

person games are incredibly complicated

777
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,585
不，这个简单的水平会没有sería
no no sería that this simple level would

778
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,915
会解决三人游戏的问题
would solve three person games so that's

779
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,375
其中，约翰·纳什的诺贝尔奖进入
where John Nash's Nobel Prize comes into
