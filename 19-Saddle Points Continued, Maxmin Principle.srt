我之所以对马鞍点感兴趣
reason I'm interested in saddle points

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,265
是我们深入学习的时候
is when we get to this deep learning

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,045
方向你知道那一大步
direction you know that the big step

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,845

梯度下降和各种问题
gradient descent and all kinds of issues

20
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,775
如果你有一个马鞍会发生什么
arise what happens if you have a saddle

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,385
指向或退化和
point that's or or degenerate and

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,485
最小化所有这些可能性和
minimum all these possibilities and the

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,044
对深度学习的理解是
understanding of deep learning is is

24
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:21,495
重点越来越多地又有什么
focusing more and more on what does that

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,065
梯度下降算法产生如此我
gradient descent algorithm produce so I

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,445
只是想到马鞍极小和马克西玛我们
just thought saddle minima and Maxima we

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,465
了解鞍点是善良的
know about saddle points are kind of a

28
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,224
有些模糊呃权等等，所以这是什么
little hazy er right so so what this is

29
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:42,075
一个完美的例子，我只想说一个
a perfect example and I'll just say a

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,895
关于它的更多话，我想
few more words about it then I want to

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,775
我大胆地谈论实验室三
talk about the lab three that I boldly

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,294
张贴在恒星和约
posted on the on stellar and also about

33
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,474
项目只是为了让你让我们思考
projects just to get you get us thinking

34
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,614
关于那些，然后我的真实
about those and then and then my real

35
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:10,954
今天和本周的数学主题是
math topic for today and this week is

36
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,025
统计学的基本思想
basic ideas of statistics

37
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,305
特别是协方差矩阵我
particularly the covariance matrix I'm

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,615
确定你已经达到了平均值和方差
sure you've met mean and variance those

39
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,805
是最常用的词，我们将使用
are the most used words and we'll use

40
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,505
他们再后来我想去上
them again but then I want to go on to

41
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,085
协方差好，这就是即将发生的事情
covariance okay so that's what's coming

42
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,925
今天马鞍上的几句话点了很多
today a few words on saddle points a lot

43
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,325
关于实验室和任何你的话
of words about the lab and anything you

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,824
可以想问一下项目然后
can want to ask about projects and then

45
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:43,495
一些基本统计没关系
some basic statistics okay

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,915
马鞍点所以我正在采取的例子
saddle point so the example I'm taking

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,514
这是瑞利商，我正在服用
is this Rayleigh quotient and I'm taking

48
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,484
一个简单的矩阵我不妨拿一个
a simple matrix s I might as well take a

49
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,425
对角矩阵因为我可以我是
diagonal matrix because I can I it's

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,854
当然是对称的和任何对称的
symmetric of course and any symmetric

51
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:05,185
矩阵我可以改变变量
matrix I could just change variables by

52
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,454
Q矩阵和正交矩阵得到
a Q matrix and orthogonal matrix to get

53
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,245
到那样的东西，然后是X.
to something like that and then the X

54
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,685
我们在3d中，所以我们得到了一些
we're in 3d so we got a sort of

55
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,844
这里管理的规模和X矢量
manageable size here and the X vector is

56
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:27,835
UVW所以这是商X转置
UVW so this is the quotient X transpose

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,935
你看到的X恰好是5uSquared的3
X you see is just exactly 5u Squared's 3

58
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,505
v平方和1平方，我分开
v Squared's and 1 w squared and I divide

59
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,954
通过长度使事情正常化
by the length to normalize things so

60
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,264
我们知道的主要事实是什么？
what are the main facts that we know

61
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,785
与我不是要证明，但
with that I'm not going to prove but

62
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,275
什么是主要的事实是什么
what are the main facts what's the

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,794
R的最大值是最小值
maximum value of R what's the minimum

64
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,594
该函数的R值是否存在
value of R of that function and is there

65
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:06,175
一个马鞍点，所以马鞍是可以的
a saddle point so saddle up are ok

66
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,965
什么是最大价值有多大
what's the maximum value how large could

67
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,935
你把那个比率设为大写R我就是
you make that ratio capital R I just

68
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,715
认为你知道这不是一个标准
think you know this isn't a standard

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,734
1806年的主题，但它有一个例子
topic in 1806 but it with an example

70
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,125
像这样你会看到重点
like this you'll see the whole point

71
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,384
好吧，我有多大可以做R
okay so how large could I make R

72
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,985
继续说它是西格玛1而不是什么
go ahead and say it Sigma 1 and but what

73
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,055
在这里让我们来做这些
is it here let's just do with these

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,105
数字我可以达到多大比例
numbers how big can I make that ratio or

75
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,814
以及uvw的选择是什么让它变得更大
and and what choice of uvw makes it big

76
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:46,464
所以我能得到多大就是那个
so how big I can get it is 5 that that

77
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,645
比例不能超过5个，你看它
ratio can't be more than 5 you see it

78
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,344
将是5好我怎么得到5
would be 5 well how do I get to 5

79
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:56,934
R的最大值是5，什么是UVW
maximum of R is 5 and what is the UVW

80
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,964
所以我会说选择什么
that that so I'll say at what choice of

81
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,265
uvw会给你我们5你看到它
uvw would give us 5 here you you see it

82
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,765
马上100然后呢
immediately 1 0 0 and what about the

83
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,004
至少我们这个比率的最小值
minimum of our the minimum of this ratio

84
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,705
我怎么能把这个比例做得很好我
how do I make that ratio small well I

85
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,825
把我装载什么东西进入W代替
put I load stuff onto W instead of

86
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,374
把它加载到你的右边就是这样
loading it up on to you right it's just

87
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,765
很清楚究竟什么是最小值
it's clear so what is the minimum value

88
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,874
我们的1因为我会加载一切
of our 1 because I'll load everything

89
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,015
进入W所以最小值为1
into W so the minimum value will be 1

90
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,615
而那将是在向量001我
and that'll be at the vector 0 0 1 I've

91
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,914
把所有东西装在那里然后在那里
loaded everything there and then at the

92
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,064
这个简短的讨论的点是
point of this short discussion is is

93
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,365
还有另一个地方
there another place where the

94
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,455
AR的衍生物一阶导数是
derivatives first derivatives of AR are

95
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,355
所有这就是那个当然的地方
all 0 that's that's where of course the

96
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,414
一阶导数最大为0
first derivatives are are 0 at the max

97
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,605
在最后但我们也有3
at the min but we also we have we have 3

98
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,515
变量在这里，我们将找到
variables here and we're going to find

99
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,545
第三点，什么是点
the third point and what is that point

100
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,055
你可能猜到了，会是什么
you probably guess and what will be the

101
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,654
马鞍价值所以你必须看到一些
saddle value so so you have to see some

102
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:19,224
我想是什么样的表面
kind of a surface that that I guess what

103
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,004
我们是4d所以我们有矢量
are we in 4d so we have we have vectors

104
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,944
我们有基准坐标UVW和r
we have base base coordinates UVW and r

105
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,084
垂直，我们绘制表面
goes vertically and we plot that surface

106
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:37,615
我们并不真正理解它，除非
and we don't really understand it unless

107
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,194
我们想到了很多我们没有的东西
we think a lot about it which we haven't

108
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,884
但
but

109
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:43,374
我们可以很好地猜测是什么和
we can pretty well guess what's what and

110
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,105
你认为马鞍的价值是什么？
so what do you think is the saddle value

111
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,235
它将在何处达成
and where is it going to be reached

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,314
每个人都会正确地告诉我
everybody's going to tell me correctly

113
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,485
马鞍价值将是三
saddle value would be three at this

114
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:04,615
中间点很好，而且和这些是什么
middle point okay and and these what are

115
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,034
这三个关于矩阵
these three with respect to the matrix

116
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,555
它们是它的特征向量
they're its eigenvectors what are these

117
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,895
关于矩阵的三个数字
three numbers with respect to the matrix

118
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,955
它们就像它的特征值一样
they're its eigenvalues it's just like

119
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,895
这就是瑞利商的原因
that's why that Rayleigh quotient is

120
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,295
如此重要的功能，它是一种
such an important function it's kind of

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,664
如果你采取它的混乱功能
a messy function if you take its

122
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:25,314
衍生物，你知道你必须使用
derivative you know you've got to use

123
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,694
商数规则或使用呻吟声
the quotient rule or or use the groans

124
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,904
乘数使它成为通往的方式
multiplier to make it that's the way to

125
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,274
让它更易于管理，但它有点像
make it more manageable but it's kind of

126
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,224
凌乱但结果不可能
messy but the results could not be

127
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:41,274
更好的值有在
better the the values there are the

128
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,004
这些和地方的特征值
eigenvalues on these and the places

129
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:45,235
你到达他们的地方是
where you reach them are the

130
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,344
特征向量，因此最大值是最大的
eigenvectors and so the max is the most

131
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,444
这很重要，因为这是西格玛的一个
important so this is that's Sigma one

132
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:58,075
这是Sigma三或让lambda和
here's Sigma three or let lambda and

133
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,434
Sigma因为矩阵是对称的
Sigma because the matrix is symmetric

134
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,394
肯定的，在中间
positive-definite and here in the middle

135
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,325
是Sigma2，如果我们想要计算的话
is Sigma 2 and if we want to compute

136
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:17,934
得到的特征值和特征向量
eigenvalues and eigenvectors getting the

137
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,314
最大的一个或最小的一个是很多
largest one or the smallest one is a lot

138
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,745
比获得更快更普遍
quicker and in general than getting

139
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,444
这些中间你必须得到你
these ones in the middle you have to you

140
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,784
知道使用好的代码并支付
know use good codes and and pay

141
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,214
注意计算他们的马鞍
attention to computing their saddle

142
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,094
点数值所以我有什么好看的
point values so is there anything nice I

143
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,795
可以用马鞍点怎么做
can do with saddle points how does how

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,625
可以一个人如何思考
could one how does one think about

145
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,615
马鞍点
saddle points

146
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,295
所以再次定义鞍点
so again saddle point is defined by

147
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,275
第一
first

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,855
衍生物等于零和那个
derivatives equal zero that's and the

149
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,635
二阶导数没问题就是这样的
second derivatives okay so that's that's

150
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,455
这里的女主人是渐变的矢量
a matron here's a vector the gradient

151
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,795
矢量有两条河流尊重你
vector there two rivers respect to you

152
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,665
RDW中的相应V只是一个
that a respective V in the RDW just a

153
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,305
矢量，他们都是那些
vector and they're all all those

154
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,305
组件是梯度向量的0
components are 0 the the gradient vector

155
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,295
是0但是二阶导数呢？
is 0 but what about second derivatives

156
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,005
嗯，这是获得更多他们很多
well that's getting more they're a lot

157
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,435
那里有九个，因为我有
there nine of those now because I've got

158
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,175
你是二阶导数吗？
are you you second derivative with

159
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,715
尊重你，然后我，但我
respect to you second and then but I've

160
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,275
得到混合衍生二阶导数
got mixed derivative second derivative

161
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,345
R对你来说DV是这样的
of R with respect to do you DV so I have

162
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,405
一个三乘三矩阵
a three by three matrix

163
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,665
幸运的是，矩阵是对称的
fortunately that matrix is symmetric

164
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,985
因为我们有我们的祝福那
because we have we're blessed by that

165
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,535
奇妙的事实，导数与
wonderful fact that the derivative with

166
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,255
相对于U然后V与V相同
respect to U and then V is the same as V

167
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,955
然后你就这样我们得到一个对称的
and then you so we get a symmetric

168
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:10,015
矩阵，它很好，我不会写它
matrix and it's well I won't write it

169
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:16,855
虽然它会有一个你
down but it's it's going to have a you

170
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,705
知道它会有最大值
know will it's got there is a maximum

171
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,465
最小和鞍座信息
minimum and and saddled information

172
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,025
在这里建造这是另外一种
built in here's this one additional sort

173
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,805
我想谈谈马鞍
that I want to communicate about saddle

174
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,435
点，因为它真的很高兴
points because it's really nice to

175
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,715
不知何故回到最大值和最小值等等
somehow get back to maxima and minima so

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,745
我们的想法这个想法鞍
the idea of us this idea for a saddle

177
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,285
要点是能够把它写成
point is to be able to write it as the

178
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:51,745
在某种程度上是最小的，是的
maximum of a minimum in a way yeah so

179
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,725
让我这样做，然后我就完成了
let me do that and then I'm all done

180
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,955
好的
okay

181
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,285
所以我会说，拉姆达到
so I'm going to say that lambda to that

182
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,515
值是某事物的最大值
value is the maximum of over something

183
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,805
最低限度的
of the minimum over something of

184
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:13,255
我们的功能的极端可以
extremes of our of our function okay

185
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,625
那很好我必须告诉你什么
that's nice I have to tell you what

186
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,055
你正在最大限度地发挥你的作用
you're maximizing over and what you're

187
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,394
尽量减少，但这个想法是
minimizing over but that's the idea is

188
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,365
进入中间的一种方式
that one way to get into the middle

189
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,274
中间的地方那里有马鞍
middle of place there where the saddles

190
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,055
坐着是最多的一个
are sitting is to have a maximum of a

191
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,475
最小的，这就是我所领导的
minimum and that leads this what I'm

192
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,565
即将在这里完成将带领你
about to complete here would lead you

193
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,435
例如很快就到了
for example very quickly to the

194
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,845
我谈到的隔行扫描定理
interlacing theorem that I spoke about

195
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,644
对于特征值或对于奇异值
for for eigen values or and for singular

196
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:52,075
当你打扰或什么时候你的价值观
values of when you perturb s or when you

197
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,105
扔掉你的一排列
throw away a row and column of s you you

198
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,644
特征值介于两者之间
the eigen values go in between that is

199
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:03,055
那种结论，这最大最小的
the kind of conclusion that this max-min

200
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,565
东西设置为生产所以这里让
stuff is set up to produce so here let

201
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,665
我只是告诉你这将是我
me just tell you what it would be I'm

202
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,065
旨在让lambda好起来，所以我
aiming to get lambda to okay so I'm

203
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,165
最大限度地要做到两个
gonna take a maximum over to be a two

204
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:26,905
维空间子空间
dimensional spaces sub subspaces

205
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:32,725
r3的子空间我们在3d中，所以我就是你
subspaces of r3 we're in 3d so I'm you

206
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,195
可以看到那种像两个
can see that sort of like two

207
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,665
维度空间让我给出了
dimensional spaces let me give that

208
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,725
子空间有一个像V的名字啊是啊那个
subspace a name like V ah yeah that'll

209
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,855
做猫V每个人都可以看到那是一个
do cat V everybody can see that that's a

210
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,894
卡菲和那么这将是最低的
caffee and then this will be the minimum

211
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:57,765
卵巢，所以它是有点棘手的
ovaries so it's um it's kind of tricky

212
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,675
所以我采取任何子空间
so I take any subspace that's

213
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,095
二维，我会拿一个
two-dimensional and I'll take one in a

214
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,605
那一刻，我会找出最小
moment and I'll figure out the minimum

215
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,364
假设我选择了男子的子空间V.
suppose I take the subspace V whose men

216
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:18,535
它是由前两个跨越的
which is spanned by the first two it's

217
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,234
应该是一个跨越的二维子空间
supposed to be a 2d subspace spanned by

218
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:28,095
第一个假设我尝试示例
the first suppose I try example example

219
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:39,475
其他的跨度为100和010
the span of 1 0 0 and 0 1 0 in other

220
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:48,564
单词所有向量uv0这是一个2d
words all vectors u v 0 that's a 2d

221
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:55,725
空间确定最小的是什么
space ok what is the minimum of that

222
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,254
瑞利商指那两个
Rayleigh quotient over that two

223
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,134
维度空间所以现在我正在服用
dimensional space so now I'm taking a

224
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,454
至少我没有必要考虑
minimum I don't have to think about

225
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,044
马鞍点所以我很喜欢我
saddle points so I'm in all so I'm

226
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:09,535
看着同样的但是我已经W但是0
looking at the same but I've but W is 0

227
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,725
现在每个人都看到了我的意思
now everybody sees that that I've

228
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,924
将它压缩到2d所以W为0就是这样
squeezed it down to 2d so W is 0 what so

229
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,225
什么是最低限度，所以这个
what is the minimum now so so this this

230
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,054
事情会成为这个空间会
thing would become for this space would

231
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,624
成为5u平方和3V
become the 5 u squared and the 3 V

232
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:30,475
在平方加上B平方
squared over the u squared plus the B

233
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,014
平方
squared

234
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,674
但是W是0所以最小值是0
but the W is 0 so what's the minimum of

235
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,694
那33好的
that 3 3 ok

236
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,605
这个特殊的最小值是3
the minimum is 3 for this particular

237
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,215
空间让我称之为V特殊
space let me call it V special that for

238
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,444
该特定空间最小为3
that particular space the minimum is 3

239
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:53,845
正确的每个人都看到了因为我
correct everybody sees that because I

240
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,155
只需要U和V来玩5和
just have U and V to play with the 5 and

241
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,454
3如果我把所有东西都放入VI中
the 3 so if I put everything into V I

242
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,454
到达3，现在我采取最大值
get to the 3 and now I take the maximum

243
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,134
所以我已经了解到这一点
so so I've learned that this so the

244
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,674
最大值至少为3，因为这个
maximum is at least 3 because this

245
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,215
特别选择V给了我
particular choice of V gave me the

246
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,274
回答3，现在我采取了最大化
answer 3 and now I'm taking the maximum

247
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,045
在所有可能的2d空间和
over all possible 2d spaces and

248
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,505
当然我有三个为一
certainly I got three for one of the

249
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,535
我和V的可能空间可能会得到
possible spaces of V and I might get

250
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,995
对于其他一些人来说高于三个但是
higher than three for some other one but

251
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,255
实际上我没有
actually I don't

252
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,305
事实是，这将证明，以
the truth is that the this turns out to

253
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,485
三个这当然是什么
be three which is of course exactly what

254
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,334
我们想要，所以我说这个
we wanted so I'm saying that this

255
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,475
特别是二维空间
particular two dimensional space the

256
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,635
最小值超过最小值
minimum of over that minimum the minimum

257
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,725
有三个，现在我最大化了
there is three and now I maximize over

258
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,045
所有其他人，所以这个想法就是这样
all others and and so the idea is that

259
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,454
对于任何其他人，最小值将
for any other one the minimum value will

260
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,365
低于三，所以当我去
be below three and therefore when I go

261
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,074
对于最多的分钟，我得到三分钟，所以我
for the max of the mins I get three so I

262
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,385
重复一遍，然后保持沉默
just repeat that and then be quiet about

263
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,735
整个主题，所以它是最大的
this whole subject so it's a maximum

264
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,024
超过子空间
over subspaces

265
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,625
如果，瑞利商的最小值
of a minimum of the Rayleigh quotient if

266
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,755
子空间完全是完美的
that subspace is exactly the perfect

267
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,715
选择这个我得到的价值三
choice this one I get the value three

268
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,995
我声称这是最大的
and I'm claiming that's the biggest

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,515
我能得到的价值，因为如果我挑选任何
value I can get because if I pick any

270
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,715
其他子空间
other subspace

271
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,524
如果我选择假设的子空间怎么办？
what if I pick the subspace that suppose

272
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:44,625
假设另一个V将是所有向量
suppose another V would be all vectors

273
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,095
0vw
0vw

274
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,465
什么是最小的我会
what would be the minimum what would I

275
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,185
得到的最低的这件事情，但
get for the minimum of this thing but

276
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,725
现在W在图片中而U不在
now W is in the picture and U is not in

277
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,675
图片你会得到我的
the picture what would I get for the

278
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,095
至少我会得到一个
minimum there what I'd get one the

279
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,074
最小的是，当我把一切
minimum would be when I put everything

280
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,655
进入W，我得到了一个，然后当我
into W and I got one and then when I

281
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,235
取最大值这不是一个赢家是
take the max it's not a winner it's

282
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,795
抛出胜利者就是那个
thrown out the winner will be the that

283
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,975
空间和三个所以我想我
space and the three so I guess I'm

284
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,645
希望你能看到这一点
hoping that you sort of see in this

285
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,865
你可以表达这个的小例子
small example that you can express this

286
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:32,635
中间马鞍值因为它是合理的
middle saddle value as it's reasonable

287
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,495
在某些人看来它是最大的
think of it as a maximum in some

288
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,815
方向和最低限度
directions and a minimum

289
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,145
另一个想到好的尝试思考
another think of the well try to think

290
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,825
一些表面的这是在往上走
of some surface which is going up in

291
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,435
某些方向因此它是最小的
some directions so it's a minimum in

292
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,345
这些方向和它的下降在
those directions and it's going down in

293
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,595
其他方向因此它是最大的
other direction so it's a max in those

294
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,495
方向和萨罗点只是栖息
directions and Salo points just perched

295
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,995
在那个地方的那个地方
in there at that right at that place at

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,085
你知道如果你喜欢的马鞍点
the saddle point you know if you're like

297
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,545
从这里徒步到加利福尼亚或
hiking from here to California or

298
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,495
那里的东西是怎么回事你要
something there's going you're going to

299
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,345
通过一个马鞍点实际上你看到它
pass a saddle point actually you see it

300
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,195
他们在MassPike是一个惊人的
on them at the Mass Pike is an amazing

301
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,425
小小的一点我不知道是否
little little sign I don't know if

302
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,305
如果你开车向西你已经注意到了这一点
you've noticed it if you drive west on

303
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,665
远足或西部的质量派克
the Mass Pike pretty far or west of

304
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,155
波士顿有一个小标志说
Boston there's a little sign saying

305
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,495
告诉你海拔高度
telling you the altitude or elevation

306
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,705
什么，它说这就是
whatever and it says there this is the

307
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,375
最高点，直到你到达
highest point until you reach the

308
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,265
落基山脉基本上就是这样，好吧
Rockies basically that's it like okay

309
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:45,115
中西部地区相当平坦，因为
Midwest is pretty flat right and because

310
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,005
这是一个很长的路，你不认为
that's a long way away you don't think

311
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,495
马萨诸塞州就像真的一样
of Massachusetts as like really in the

312
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,765
有很高分的大联盟，但有它
big league with high spots but there it

313
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,005
是
is

314
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,885
它是最高的，直到你得到我
it's the highest one until you get and I

315
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,805
认为它告诉你下一个在哪里
think it tells you where where the next

316
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,225
无论如何，一个人将在科罗拉多州
one will be in Colorado anyway those

317
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,935
最高点往往是马鞍
highest points are tend to be saddles

318
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,325
最高点在哪里
the very very highest point where is

319
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,965
在阿拉斯加或那个地方
that in Alaska or somewhere that that's

320
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,295
根据定义，当然最大但是那里
a max of course by definition but there

321
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,575
在其他方面有很多马鞍点
are a lot of saddle points in in other

322
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,635
地方和那些将是千里马
places and those would be Maxima of

323
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,745
minima或minimaMaxima好我
minima or minima Maxima good I'm

324
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,835
停在那里我们可能会再次看到这一点
stopping there we might see this again

325
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,905
当我们开始梯度下降但是在
when we start a gradient descent but at

326
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,875
至少是因为马鞍点不来
least because saddle points don't come

327
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,485
我想，在微积分教学方面做了很多
up much in teaching calculus I thought

328
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,544
这是很好的好吗
that was good okay

329
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:52,235
第二点是模型实验室3和
second point is models lab 3 and

330
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,495
预测你想问的任何事情
projects anything you'd like to ask

331
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,455
关于项目所以请这是你的
about projects so please this is your

332
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,544
有机会问你也可以问
chance to ask you could also ask by

333
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,835
如果您有建议或，请通过电子邮件通知您
email you if you have a suggested or

334
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,164
一个项目的想法让我鼓励你
idea for a project let me encourage you

335
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:14,435
或者一个团队来处理它或只是你自己
or a team to work on it or just yourself

336
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,255
如果你想认为我可以得到
and if you want to think ok shall I get

337
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,505
这听起来有些反馈
some feedback of does this sound

338
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,315
明智的任何建议发给我一个
sensible any suggestions send me an

339
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,674
电子邮件
email

340
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,945
是的，我会很高兴，因为我是一个
yeah I'll be happy to because I'm a

341
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,615
我创建时也是初学者
total beginner here too when I created

342
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,875
这个实验室3我非常绝望
this lab 3 I was like desperate not for

343
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,495
您看过模型1的模型1
model 1 for model 1 have you looked at

344
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,495
这是它的在线它已达到
the it's online it's it's reached

345
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,355
恒星
stellar

346
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,815
它只是人们打印的一页
it's only one printed page the people

347
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,885
看看这个
had a look at this

348
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,315
所以我只是快速重复模型1
so I'll just repeat quickly model 1 is

349
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,025
是一个过度拟合的例子
is a example where of overfitting and

350
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,534
和模型1发生了什么
and what's going on with model 1 so

351
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:15,615
模型一说五取就够了
model one says take five would be enough

352
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,554
但我可能会说10或者其他什么
but I probably said 10 or something so

353
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,275
我会把它分为六分并放
I'll make it six points and put

354
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,414
近似通过它们曲线如此
approximate put a curve through them so

355
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:32,654
如果你画一条曲线而曲线是
if you put a curve and the curve is

356
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,445
将成为一个多项式，所以我们要去
going to be a polynomial so we're going

357
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:42,195
以适应它适合由多项式大家
to fit it fit by by polynomial everybody

358
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,784
知道多项式是Cnaught加C1X.
knows polynomial is C naught plus C 1 X

359
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:53,705
加上K的所有CKX让我们说
plus whatever C K X to the K let's say

360
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,685
好的
okay

361
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,365
因为K等于零我不知道我是不是
for K equals zero well I don't know if I

362
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,645
甚至问零是最好的
even asked zero that would be the best

363
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,775
直线将会运行
straight line that would be run along

364
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,045
的平均K值等于一，这将是
the average k equal to one that would be

365
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,715
一条直线适合你
a straight line fit and you would

366
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,195
计算通过这些正方形，因为
compute that by these squares because of

367
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,075
当然，我们没有直线打算
course our no straight line is going to

368
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,055
通过你要去的所有要点
go through all the points you're going

369
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,355
通过最小二乘法得到一些错误
to have some error by least squares to

370
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,275
将再用抛物线装配
would be fitting by a parabola again

371
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,575
你会有一些错误但是因为更小
you'll have some error but smaller since

372
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,705
抛物线包括直线所以你
parabolas include straight lines so you

373
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,095
只能减少总平方和
can only reduce total sum of squares

374
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,865
进入2级3级的错误
error by going to degree 2 degree 3 and

375
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:46,755
多达多少分，所以我们采取12让
up to how many points so we take 1 2 let

376
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,645
我只是使用我用过的同一封信
me just use the same letter I've used

377
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:55,725
这可能是哦哦，MM是
here probably of oh well the M M is the

378
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,775
点数但M在两者之间变化
number of points but M varies between

379
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,435
有一点我猜，而且可能是一个
one point I guess and and probably an

380
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:13,755
终点是啊或者K可以达到最高点
end point yeah or maybe K up to up to up

381
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,755
最多六个让我们说好，我想要
to up to six let's say okay and I want

382
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,005
对六个没有五个发表评论
to make a comment about six no five

383
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,575
会这样做不会5度5适合
would do it won't 5 degree 5 will fit

384
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,185
六点，我们得到六分
the six points that we've got six points

385
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,355
在这里，但如果我停止五年级，我就是
here but if I stop a degree five I was

386
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,115
因为5次多项式更好
better there because degree 5 polynomial

387
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,085
也有一个恒定的术语，所以它真的
also has a constant term so it really

388
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,785
有六个系数，所以有一个学位
has six coefficients so there's a degree

389
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,865
有一个1度5的多项式，有六个
there's a 1 degree 5 polynomial with six

390
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,565
数字六个系数是去
numbers six coefficients that goes

391
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,835
通过这六点，它就是这样
through those six points and it so it's

392
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,815
完美契合
a perfect fit

393
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,635
这将是该数据的精确配合，以便
that would be exact fit of the data so

394
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,965
这里的数据创建了一个多项式
here's the data create a polynomial of

395
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,115
5级，通过这些点
degree 5 that goes through those points

396
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,925
确切地看看结果和什么
exactly and look at the result and what

397
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,625
你会看到什么
what would you see

398
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,685
如果你看看结果会是
if you look at the result would it be

399
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,525
顺便说一下，这是多项式的
smooth of course it's a polynomial would

400
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,195
很好
it be nice

401
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,655
没有这将是可怕的，它会得到
no it'll be horrible it'll to get

402
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,315
通过这些点我得到六点
through those points did I get six

403
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,495
点是的，以通过这些点
points yeah to get through those points

404
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,405
我猜那个五度
I'm guessing that that fifth degree

405
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,615
多项式完美拟合就是一个例子
polynomial the perfect fit is an example

406
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,785
实际上每个人都会发生这种情况
that occurs to practically everybody of

407
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,455
过度拟合，因为这样做
overfitting because do that making that

408
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,055
决定
decision

409
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,845
完美契合学习数据
perfect fit learn that learn the data

410
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,295
训练数据正是我们要派
training data exactly we'll send the

411
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,845
多项式我不知道它的样子
polynomial I don't know what it looks

412
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,385
喜欢
like

413
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,565
我不想要，但我确实想知道
I don't want well I do want to know but

414
00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:00,295
不管怎样，现在还不是疯狂的
not right now anyway craziness and of

415
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,375
当然，我要问这样的
course I'm going to ask like that

416
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,515
可能我会要求你策划
probably I'm gonna ask you to plot the

417
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,795
结果是什么是最小的方块
results well what's the least squares

418
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,255
当你用直线拟合时会出错
error when you fit by a straight line

419
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,315
当你适合水平时适合
when you fit when you fit by horizontal

420
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,015
由直线排列的恒定配合
line a constant fit by a straight line

421
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,565
拉升至抛物线向上移动到生成立方体
move up to parabolas move up to cubics

422
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,405
但是当你击中它时你不是
but when you hit the hit this you're not

423
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,595
你知道自己犯了任何错误
making any error at all you know you're

424
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,265
不是真的需要使用这些方块
not really needing to use these squares

425
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,855
你能解决斧头等于BAC会
you could solve ax equal B a C will be

426
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,145
等于B所以这些是B的东西
equals B so these this is the B thing

427
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:45,265
C是系数的向量
and C is the vector of of coefficients

428
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:52,545
和矩阵A是个坏消息时，它的
and the matrix a is bad news when it's

429
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,495
6x6，当你完全适应
6x6 when you get up to a complete fit

430
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,525
我想我想要看到的东西
and I guess what I want to just to see

431
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,325
是很多我不知道的事情
is a lot of things I don't know like

432
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,835
假设我将6改为20或其他什么
suppose I change 6 to 20 or something

433
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,115
然后我很确定不会外出
then I'm pretty sure that not out out

434
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,015
那里是181920这件事真的
there at 18 19 20 this thing is really

435
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,415
离开地图，你可以
off the map and you could you could

436
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,655
计算它的最大值，你会看到一个非常的
compute its max and and you'd see a very

437
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,925
大数
big number

438
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,695
但我当然不知道在哪里
but I don't know where but of course for

439
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,345
一条漂亮的直线
a straight line that would be pretty

440
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,855
安全的斜坡将是相当温和的
safe the slope would be pretty moderate

441
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,245
我不知道你在哪儿
and I don't know where are you so so

442
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,945
这可能不适合尝试
that's probably under fitting to try to

443
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,795
这是一条直线，这就是它
fit this by a straight line it's it's

444
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,405
没有你想要的那么接近但是
not as close as you would want but

445
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,575
装配完全完美贴合高
fitting by a full perfect fitting high

446
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,285
度多项式当然是
degree polynomial is certainly

447
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,745
过度拟合哪里是边界
overfitting where where is the boundary

448
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,025
我相信人们都知道这件事，但我
I'm sure people know about this but I

449
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,145
认为这是我们可以学到的东西
think it is something we could learn

450
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,275
从不过就是这样一个模型是什么
from so that's what that model one is

451
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,425
关于并且只是做出最后的评论
about and just to make one final comment

452
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,175
矩阵a在案例中有一个名称
that matrix a has a name in the case

453
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,475
你在哪里它是一个方阵
where you're where it's a square matrix

454
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,705
你完全适合的地方
where you're fitting exactly

455
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,355
插值我会是这样的
interpolating I would be the word so

456
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:27,965
那就是完全符合对应的
there so that exact fit that corresponds

457
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:35,195
方阵a和它的字
to square matrix a and the word for it

458
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:43,715
是插值，我猜它就像
is interpolation and I guess it's like

459
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,475
错了再次看到那个家伙
wrong again seeing that guy too often

460
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,155
在这里它就像呻吟声
here so it'd be like groans

461
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,725
插值但矩阵有一个
interpolation but the matrix has a

462
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,765
不同的名称和名称
different name and whose name is

463
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,045
与该矩阵vandermonde相关联
associated with that matrix vandermonde

464
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,965
vandermonde所以这是方阵
vandermonde so this is the square matrix

465
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,225
这是让我这样写的
which was so let me write it this is

466
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:18,965
称为vandermonde矩阵，它就是
called a vandermonde matrix and and it's

467
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,295
有一个疯狂大的矩阵
the matrix that has a crazy large

468
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,855
因为正如我所说的那样
inverse because just as I'm saying the

469
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,865
从完美的契合中看出来
see that comes out from the perfect fit

470
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,325
来自广场的插值
from the interpolation from the square

471
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:36,125
矩阵C的将是巨大的，因此
matrix the C is going to be giant and so

472
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,035
您
you

473
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,615
你能说得对，你能够
you could right you'll be able to you

474
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,855
你将构建一个矩阵
you you will construct a matrix of

475
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,735
当然要做到这一点，它会
course to do this and it will be

476
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,425
与供应商完全相同，所以我们听说过
identical to the vendor so we've heard

477
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,645
这个词vandermonde矩阵在此
this word vandermonde matrix in this

478
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,805
上周上课
class within the last week

479
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,955
任何人记住这个词的位置
anybody remember where the word

480
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,065
范德蒙德上课了
vandermonde came up in class it was in

481
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,945
汤森教授的讲座让你如此
professor Townsend's lecture so you

482
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,775
如果你可以回到那个视频
could go back to that video if you

483
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,365
想要作为矩阵的一个例子
wanted as an example of matrix which

484
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,655
这是一个可怕的逆转巨人
which had a horrible inverse a giant

485
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,965
矩阵Hilbert矩阵是另一个
matrix the Hilbert matrix was another

486
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,245
例子我认为他做了两个例子
example I think he did two examples

487
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,125
范德蒙和希尔伯特等等无孔
vandermonde and Hilbert so ventless

488
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,345
vandermonde矩阵我可以写下来
vandermonde matrix i could write it down

489
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:29,475
但你会留给你一个大的
but you'll leave that to you has a big

490
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,765
逆，它的特征值是什么
inverse and it's its eigenvalues what no

491
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,565
奇异的价值因为它不是
singular values because it's not

492
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,185
对称的奇异值是方式
symmetric its singular values are way

493
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,225
分散你知道它有点小
scattered you know it has tiny little

494
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,095
奇异值加上普通尺寸
singular values plus an ordinary size

495
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,095
奇异值，这就是例子
singular values so that's the example

496
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,585
我只是觉得，你可以与去
that I just think you could go with and

497
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,305
据我可以看到你把它发送到
as far as I can see you sending it to

498
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,835
作为朱莉娅文件的自动编程器，它将是均匀的
autograder as a Julia file it'll be even

499
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,525
比平时差将其发送到
worse than usual sending it to

500
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,155
autograder
autograder

501
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,945
他们不会认为它不会知道什么
they won't I think it wouldn't know what

502
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,195
这样做，据我看到，所以我
to do as far as I can see so I'm

503
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,925
想一些即将到来的提交
thinking of some submissions to coming

504
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,645
评分范围，我正在考虑一些
to grade scope and I'm thinking of some

505
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,235
图表显示K发生了什么
plots to show what happens as K

506
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,115
增加和一些数据表可能
increases and some tables of data maybe

507
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,675
然后可能的一个段落
and then maybe a paragraph of of

508
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,215
结论如何安全程度
conclusion like how what degree is safe

509
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,855
什么时候变得有风险？
and when does it become risky and when

510
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,855
它会变成灾难吗？
does it become disaster so stuff like

511
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,895
这才是真正的这些
that that's it's really these are sort

512
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,615
开放式实验室和你使用任何
of open-ended labs and and you use any

513
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,095
语言
language

514
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,804
关于那个例子的问题是
questions about that example which is

515
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:59,395
真的，这就是我期待到
really that's what I'm expecting to to

516
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,674
做好准备并且相当不错
be ready and and and quite quite a good

517
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:11,355
休息后的星期三的例子
example for Wednesday after the break

518
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,935
无论如何你甚至可以提出什么问题
what question are anyway you could even

519
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,895
给我发电子邮件你可能看到他们可以看到
email me you probably see they could see

520
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,034
那个模型看起来是什么样的
what what that model looks like then

521
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,904
第二个我第一次跳
second one I've taken the first jump

522
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:32,154
进入网络做了一个非常简单的网络
into networks made a very simple network

523
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,615
没有很多没有任何隐藏
without a lot of without any hidden

524
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,904
层实际上只是写了
layers at all actually and just wrote

525
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:42,294
我觉得可能有用，但你可以
down what I think might work but you may

526
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,375
发现你想修改模型去
find that you want to modify model to go

527
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,695
为此，我没有任何专利或
for it I I don't have any patent or

528
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,815
模式二的个人利益是
personal stake in the way model two is

529
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,875
写的，但这个想法适合数据和
written but the idea is fit data and

530
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,745
我们将从数据开始但不做到
we'll start with data but don't make it

531
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,615
太完美了，因为我们不想要我们
too perfect because we don't want we

532
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,395
想要一些学习在这里发生等等
want some learning to happen here and so

533
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,424
所以它是分类问题所以它
so it's the classification problem so it

534
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:22,465
并不是最小的方格与它
won't be least squares with a with it

535
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,195
使用U，V和W这样的变量
with variables like U and V and W it's

536
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,265
只加1或减1或10或猫和
just plus 1 or minus 1 or 1 0 or cat and

537
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,025
狗无论分类如此
dog whatever the classification is so

538
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:36,685
这就是启动基本的基本问题
that's the basic basic problem to start

539
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,235
与深入学习相当
with in deep learning to for quite a

540
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,294
很长一段时间这就是自然的问题，所以
long time that's the natural problem so

541
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:46,695
这是一个分类问题和
it's a classification problem and the

542
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,664
这里的描述提出了一种设定方法
description here suggests one way to set

543
00:32:50,669 --> 00:33:00,375
提取训练数据并执行
up the training data and and execute a

544
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,695
神经网络一样通过实验
neural net like experiment by

545
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,155
-但没有离得很远
- but without getting very far away from

546
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:14,195
普通-线性代数是的，所以你如果
ordinary - linear algebra yeah so you if

547
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,175
你要我说，如果你想
you want as I say if you wanted to

548
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:22,145
改变这种发展它进一步得到一些
change this develop it further get some

549
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,085
关于它的想法就是那个是什么
ideas about it that's what that's what

550
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,795
重点在这里
the whole point is here

551
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,305
实际上是教师在这方面的会议
actually the faculty meeting on this

552
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:37,705
也许今天是星期三的今天
week maybe today what's today Wednesday

553
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,165
是的所以今天下午没有教职员工
yeah so it's this afternoon no faculty

554
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,495
并不是因为它而已
doesn't come to much but because it's

555
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,275
下午晚些时候，但教职员工
late in the afternoon but faculty

556
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,885
今天下午的会议是麻省理工学院
meeting this afternoon is about MIT

557
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:56,215
计划的要求或课程
plans for requirements or courses in

558
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,635
计算思维和某种方式
computational thinking and in a way this

559
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,575
在数学系当然是
course within the math department is

560
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,285
在其中的那些
among the ones that are in that

561
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,325
当然在其他部门的方向
direction of course in other departments

562
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:17,585
无论如何，这些都是进一步的
those are further along anyway when

563
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,065
rajarao去年春天教他的课程
rajarao taught the course last spring he

564
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,525
朱莉娅系统得到了更好的发展
had the Julia system better developed

565
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,435
并且，有这样一个机会，让
and and there was a chance to bring

566
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,385
电脑和携带笔记本电脑，并做
computers and bring laptops and do do

567
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,815
事情在课堂上，你将有
things in class and and you'll have that

568
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,215
当他在一次访问时再次有机会
chance again when he visits in in a

569
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:45,875
一个月好了，我很开心
month ok enough and and I'm open to

570
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,145
关于这个项目的问题我应该
questions about the project should I

571
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,414
也许会请你给我发一个粗略的想法
maybe ask you to email me a rough idea

572
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:56,885
一个项目并告诉我你是否在
of a project and tell me if you were in

573
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,105
一组或者，如果你想找到一个
a group or if you would like to find a

574
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,915
我可能是两三个人
group of maybe two or three people I'm

575
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,215
没有想到组五十两
not thinking of groups of fifty two or

576
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,465
其中3位是约明智的问题
three would be sensible questions about

577
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,245
项目我的意思是我刚刚介绍过这个
projects I mean I just introduced this

578
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,585
我们项目的想法
idea of our project

579
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,245
我为它而不是食物而道歉
and I apologize for it not the food not

580
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,135
这样做不会把它提起来
doing it that not bringing it up the

581
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,165
第一周，但我只是看不到我
first week but I just couldn't see I

582
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,715
不想在线性代数上做考试
don't want to do exams on linear algebra

583
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,895
我们通过了这一点，所以这似乎是
we passed that point so this seemed the

584
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,725
正确的方式，但我不是你知道我
right way to go but I'm not you know I'm

585
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,225
不在这里寻找博士论文
not looking for a PhD thesis here

586
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,395
问题想法我想我希望你
questions thoughts I guess I hope you

587
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:55,775
知道你可以问哦，好的将如何
know you can ask oh good right how will

588
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:02,465
我想是的，所以范围是相关的
I I think yeah so the scope is connected

589
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,945
到你投入的时间
to the time that you would devote to it

590
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,955
我应该怎么说范围
and what should I say about scope maybe

591
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,145
相当于三个作业或
the equivalent of three homeworks or

592
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,775
一些事情，因为我都会平息
something because I'll all tamp down

593
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,635
家庭作业说项目日期越来越近
homework says project date gets closer

594
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,305
不，我给你知道这是一个想法
does I give an idea that you know it's

595
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,865
它是如此，它不是无限的，但它是
it's so it's not not infinite but it's

596
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:37,855
不是微不足道的小事，是的好
not something tiny and trivial yeah good

597
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,325
好吧那就是没有的东西
well that's the thing there aren't

598
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,495
真的过去几年我们虽然是
really past years we are though we are

599
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:52,795
那些我们明年会有的
the ones so so we I will have next year

600
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,435
如果你贡献一些好主意也许
if you contribute some good ideas maybe

601
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,005
我应该问我
I should should I ask

602
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,215
按或退出可能会将项目发送给我们
press or out maybe send us the projects

603
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,365
他在密歇根州使用的是一些
he uses in Michigan that would be some

604
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,815
想法，但记住他做到了
ideas but remember that he does it

605
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,025
到目前为止还没有改变过程
hasn't up to now anyway moved the course

606
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:20,215
为了深入学习，他做了其他主题
toward deep learning he did other topics

607
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,645
所有这些都可以，但后来一些
all of which would be fine but then some

608
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,795
不少人有603六人
quite a few people have had some 603 six

609
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,275
或者对卷积有所了解
or know something about convolutional

610
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,995
神经网络
neural net

611
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,015
我很高兴能够做到这一点
and I'm certainly excited to get to that

612
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,925
主题所以项目可以到达那里或
topic so the project could get there or

613
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,135
它不可能都完全没问题
it could not both both totally fine okay

614
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:46,555
这是一个好主意，我会问拉吉
that's a good idea I'll ask Raj for just

615
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,355
项目，你会认识到
the projects and you'll recognize a

616
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,635
夫妻因为你做了一对夫妇
couple because you've done a couple but

617
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,595
他们是一群更是的，是的，那么
they're a bunch more yeah yeah then

618
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,075
还有另外一个问题，我
there was another question and I'm

619
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,765
记得那是我的想法
remembering that that there was I think

620
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,795
也许每个人都收到一封电子邮件，或
maybe everybody got an email or a

621
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,725
恒星公告称，一些
stellar announcement that that some

622
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,705
班上的成员采取了主动
members of the class took an initiative

623
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,335
这真是太棒了
which was wonderful to open the

624
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,945
人们出现的可能性
possibility of people just showing up

625
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,095
媒体实验室每周一个晚上
one evening a week in the Media Lab was

626
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,845
它或它是一个位置，并拥有它
it or did it was a location and has it

627
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,845
发生了或者它是未来的事件
happened or is it a future event it

628
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,045
发生好了
happened okay

629
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,335
但是我没有提到它的人
and but people I hadn't mentioned it in

630
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,285
所以可能你没有和
class so probably you didn't have and

631
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,615
还没有真正进入项目
were not really into projects yet so

632
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,855
这可能是一个安静的夜晚
what it was probably a quiet evening

633
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,735
是的，那是有成效的但是
yeah yeah and that's productive but

634
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,875
安静没关系
quiet okay

635
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,685
所以它会在春天之后再次发生
so will it happen again after spring

636
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,105
打破
break

637
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,965
好的，所以再次发布在恒星计划上
okay so post again on stellar plan for

638
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,625
人们可以来的下次会议
the next meeting that people could come

639
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,255
对啊，所以这是大卫和她的露面
to yeah so this is David and her turn up

640
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,285
那么你会认出他的名字
whoo so you'll recognize his name in

641
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,565
那里，你有没有参加会议
there and you did you have the meeting

642
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:20,195
在媒体实验室或没关系，好吧
in the Media Lab or okay okay so with

643
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,375
休息和春天有希望
the break coming and spring hopefully

644
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,575
在今天的潜在风暴之后来临
coming after today's potential storm

645
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:34,715
是的，当我们回来时，好的就是那个
yeah when we come back good okay is that

646
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,195
好，我希望一些这是很有帮助的你
good I hope some of that is helpful you

647
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,985
让你看到的一样多的想法
get an idea you're seeing about as much

648
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,015
我知道哪个是模特一个
as I know which is model one is

649
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,854
绝对做到了
definitely do

650
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:49,534
非常重要和范德蒙德
and very significant and vandermonde

651
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:52,084
矩阵易用等是真实的
matrix ease and so on are truly

652
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,385
重要的是他们的不稳定性很大
important and their instability is a big

653
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:01,925
问题，但然后走向权重和
issue but then moving toward weights and

654
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,665
并且培训数据和测试数据在哪里
and training data and test data is where

655
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:11,135
我们要去好确定，所以我有一些
we want to go good ok so do I have some

656
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,324
我只想谈谈意思和时间
time I do just to speak about mean and

657
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:19,804
变异的两个金字
variance the two golden words of

658
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:23,945
统计和协方差矩阵
Statistics and covariance the matrix the

659
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,425
线性代数与
the intersection of linear algebra with

660
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,445
统计然后一些着名的
statistics and then some famous

661
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,885
不平等所以我将继续
inequality so this I'll continue with

662
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,544
这个星期五和张贴一些
this on Friday and post some of the

663
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:39,125
材料，以便来自后来
material so that's coming from a later

664
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,764
一段笔记好吧，我可以谈谈
section of notes okay can I just talk

665
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:49,564
所以我要么有概率P1
about so I either have probabilities P 1

666
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:53,944
最多Pn加1或者我有
up to P n adding to 1 or I have a

667
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:57,925
持续分配概率
continuous distribution of probabilities

668
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,415
也许是从负无穷大的所有X的
maybe from all X's from minus infinity

669
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,464
到无穷远再次给予1让我的工作
to infinity again giving 1 let me work

670
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:07,614
与离散的例子在哪里
with the discrete example that's where

671
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,544
人们自然而然地开始，所以我有这样的
people naturally start so I have so what

672
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:18,114
是我的意思，所以我有可能
is the mean so I I've been possible

673
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:26,544
这些概率的结果和我
outcomes with those probabilities and I

674
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:29,314
我可以问你这个问题
can either I can ask you about the

675
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:37,354
样本意味着或者我可以问你关于
sample mean or I can ask you about the

676
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:46,264
预期意味着好，所以样本意味着
expected mean okay so the sample means

677
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,364
我们做了一些我们已经做过的实验
we've done an experiment we've got some

678
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:52,114
输出预期均值意味着我们知道
output the expected mean means we know

679
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,064
概率，但我们没有使用它们
probabilities but we haven't used them

680
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,864
然而
yet

681
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:57,145
所以那些
so those are

682
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:02,034
这是使用实际输出和
this is this uses actual output and the

683
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:04,705
样本意思就是让我为我
sample mean is simply let me shall I

684
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:14,265
对我说这两个是好的
just say em for me well these two are

685
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,635
重要的是不同的是数据
importantly different one is data is

686
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,465
你做过的事情
something where you've done the

687
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,645
实验，这是在你做之前
experiment and this is before you do the

688
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,495
实验和信件得到可能是Mew
experiment and the letters get maybe Mew

689
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,294
我已经改为Mew我不想用
I've changed to Mew I don't want to use

690
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:33,804
是因为S帮方差没关系使用
s because s gets used with variance okay

691
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:37,465
所以这只是平均水平
so so it's just the average average

692
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:45,354
样本的输出就像我翻转一样
output from the sample so like I flipped

693
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,895
一百万次硬币和输出
a coin a million times and the output

694
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,515
是0或1所以我有一百万和
was 0 or 1 so I got a million ones and

695
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,145
零和我取平均值而且我是
zeros and I take the average and I'm

696
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,594
期待一个像50万的数字
expecting a number like half a million

697
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,294
因为我正在想一个公平的硬币
because I'm thinking of a fair coin so

698
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:05,875
那个和大数法则会
that and the law of large numbers would

699
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,015
说这个样本意味着什么
say that that that this sample mean does

700
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,985
接近1/2，概率为1
approach 1/2 with probability 1 as the

701
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,985
样本的数目变大，从而样品
number of samples gets larger so sample

702
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,804
意思是直截了当的预期
mean is straightforward the expected

703
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:26,034
意思是指我们这些都是实际的
mean means we these are actual out

704
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:34,824
他们发生的样本输出而不是
sample outputs they happened whereas the

705
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:38,515
期望的意思是我将使用的
expected mean is just the and I'll use

706
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,715
因为这是它的概率
em for that it's it's the probability of

707
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,675
输出的第一个输出时间加
the first output times that output plus

708
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,324
第二次输出的概率
the probability of the second output

709
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:53,175
输出加上加P和X的时间没问题
times that output plus plus P and X okay

710
00:43:53,180 --> 00:44:01,495
所以它将接近那个
so it's the that will approach that with

711
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,945
概率1就是这个数字
probability 1 as this this number

712
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,225
资本n注意差异资本
capital n notice the difference capital

713
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,945
这里是样本数量
n here is the number of sample

714
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,515
试验的数量和它得到大
the number of trials and it gets big

715
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,305
我们一直在做越来越多的事情
it's we keep doing things more and more

716
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,035
这就是这个小n是数字
this is just this little n is the number

717
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,094
可能的不同产出与他们的
of possible different outputs with their

718
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:25,035
概率，你看到它和
probabilities and there you see it and

719
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,495
当然在连续的情况下我们
of course in the continuous case we

720
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,075
将采用XDX的XP积分
would take the integral of X P of X DX

721
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:38,895
所以，我只想比喻一下
so let me just by analogy you should

722
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,265
知道连续版本是什么和
know what the continuous version is and

723
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,265
什么离散形式是好的这是
what the discrete version is ok that's

724
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:50,325
对于方差样本，现在的平均值还可以
the mean okay now for variance sample

725
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:58,395
差异，我应该说预期
variance and shall I say expected

726
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,995
方差我不知道只是方差
variance I don't know just variance it's

727
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,655
人们通常会说我不会
what people would usually say I don't

728
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,485
知道我在那里记得正确的话
know if I remember the right word there

729
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:15,405
样本差异我包含的是什么
sample variance what is that I included

730
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,334
线性代数书中的这个主题
this topic in the linear algebra book

731
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:20,205
无论如何
anyway

732
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:27,155
是的好，所以样本方差是什么
yeah okay so what's the sample variance

733
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:35,955
所以为什么我猜我是的所以是什么
so why I guess I'm yeah so what is the

734
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,445
样本方差什么是方差
sample variance what's the variance

735
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,565
无论如何，关键点是什么
about anyway what's the key point of

736
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:45,185
方差它是与平均值的距离
variance it's the distance from the mean

737
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,834
所以这将是一个距离
so will be this will be a distance from

738
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,635
样本均值，这将是一个
the sample mean and this will be a

739
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,975
距预期平均值的距离不是
distance from the expected mean so not

740
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,604
距离零距离，但距离mu
distance from zero but distance from mu

741
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:02,175
和M从中心的东西好吧
and M from the center of the thing okay

742
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,145
所以我们有了样本差异
so the sample variance so again we have

743
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,195
n样品，但出于一些奇妙的原因
n samples but for some wonderful reason

744
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,344
在统计数据中，你除以n减去1
in statistics you divide by n minus one

745
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:17,505
这个时间和原因有做
this time and the reason has to do with

746
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,875
你使用过这个的事实
the fact that you used one this will

747
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,675
涉及我的意思所以这将是
involve the me mean so this would be the

748
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,205
这将是第一个输出减去亩
this would be the first output minus mu

749
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:34,895
平方到第n个输出减去视图
squared up to the nth output minus view

750
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,224
这是平均距离
squared so it's the average distance

751
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:43,214
从你的平均距离
from you average squared distance from

752
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:46,964
你，但这有点扭曲
you but with this little twist that of

753
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:49,364
当n很大时，它不是很好
course when n is large it's not a very

754
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:52,034
n和n之间的显着差异
significant difference between n and n

755
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:55,145
减一，我认为这是正确的
minus one I think that's about right

756
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,334
这一切都是我只做一个
all this is that I'm just doing one

757
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:02,524
一遍又一遍地实验协方差
experiment over and over covariance

758
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:08,175
更深层次的想法是线性的
which is the deeper idea is where linear

759
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,604
代数进来我有一个矩阵，因为
algebra comes in I have a matrix because

760
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:13,814
为什么因为我做了几次
why because I'm doing several multiple

761
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:16,955
我同时做实验
experiments at the same time I'm

762
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,135
翻转两个硬币，我正在翻转十五个
flipping two coins I'm flipping fifteen

763
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:26,385
硬币我做其他的事情，所以让
coins I'm doing other things so so that

764
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,514
我正在做的时候会是协方差
will be covariances when I'm doing

765
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:32,324
几个实验将立即
several experiments at once that will

766
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:35,834
涉及到大小的矩阵这里这么
involve matrices of that size here so

767
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,645
什么是我应该的差异
what's the what's the variance I should

768
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,375
给你平常的符号
have given you the usual notation the

769
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,854
x的期望值是什么的
expected value of x that's what's the

770
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:49,274
意思是，在这里，我在看
mean and here I'm looking at the

771
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:54,885
什么时候我的预期价值
expected value of what so when I'm

772
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,544
使用概率计算方差
computing a variance using probabilities

773
00:47:58,549 --> 00:48:02,234
所以我使用的期望不是-不是
so I'm using expectations not-not-not

774
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,195
试运行期望意味着使用
trial runs expectations means use the

775
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,094
概率和期望是什么
probabilities and what's the expectation

776
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:16,234
从X到平均值的距离
of the distance from X to the mean

777
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:22,695
方可以，那就是我什么时候
square okay and that is when I what I'm

778
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,625
期待一个离散的
doing an expectation for for a discrete

779
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,205
我想到了第一个概率
set I think of the probability the first

780
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:35,535
输出x1的概率
probability that goes with an output x1

781
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,445
和第二个概率
and a second probability that goes with

782
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:43,065
输出x2，每次减去
an output x2 and each time I subtract

783
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:48,585
从平均值和正方形好吧这样
from the mean and square okay so that's

784
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,745
每个人都称之为Sigma的差异
the variance that everybody calls Sigma

785
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,055
平方
squared

786
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:57,375
好的，现在还剩两分钟
okay now two minutes left

787
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,935
仅仅说两到几个就足够了
is it is enough to say two to a few more

788
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,595
有关协变的话在去
words about covariance over to get to

789
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,515
协方差我真的要说
covariance I really have to speak about

790
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,905
联合概率是一个吱吱作响的想法
joint probabilities that's a creaky idea

791
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,725
联合概率所以我做了两个
joint probabilities so I'm doing two

792
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:19,695
一次实验所以每个人都有它
experiments at once so each one has its

793
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:25,545
自己的可能性，但同时我也要
own probabilities but together I have to

794
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:29,475
问你知道所以这里有两个容易
ask you know so here here are two easy

795
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,125
案件假设我正在翻转两个硬币
cases suppose I'm flipping two coins so

796
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,255
我可能会得到头的头我可能会
that I might get heads heads I may get

797
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,805
尾巴尾巴尾巴或尾巴尾巴
heads tails tails heads or tails tails

798
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,595
是否有可能的产出
for possibility for possible outputs

799
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,675
可能的对没关系，如果我
there for possible pairs okay and if I

800
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,225
如果你正在翻转一枚硬币我就是
if you're flipping one coin and I'm

801
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,845
再翻一遍那些
flipping another one those are

802
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,545
那些是独立的结果
independent results those are

803
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,945
那里的独立结果不会有
independent results there there won't be

804
00:49:54,950 --> 00:50:00,315
协方差所在的地方
a covariance where where some where

805
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,315
在哪里知道我的翻转是什么
where by knowing what my flip was I

806
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,785
会更了解你的翻转，但现在
would know more about your flip but now

807
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,875
胶粘剂的另一种可能性
the other possibility would be to glue

808
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,895
如果我翻转，硬币现在在一起
the coins together now if I do a flip

809
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,285
他们总是头上或头上或者
they always come up heads and heads or

810
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,565
尾巴和尾巴所以头尾巴
tails and Tails so the heads tails

811
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:27,705
事实上，组合是不可能的
combination is not possible in fact one

812
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,345
输出完全取决于另一个
output is totally dependent on the other

813
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:32,865
输出，这是我们的另一个极端
output so that's the other extreme we

814
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,955
具有协方差的独立输出
have independent outputs with covariance

815
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,515
0，我们完全依赖输出
0 and we have totally dependent outputs

816
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,315
其中一件事只是粘在上面
one of the things are just glued

817
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,925
当一个结果告诉我们什么时，一起
together when one result tells us what

818
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:48,375
另一个结果是那种情况
the other result is then that situation

819
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,215
在哪里
where the

820
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,034
协方差是最大不可能的
the covariance is a maximum couldn't be

821
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,525
比他们大，他们在民意调查中说
bigger than that and they say in polling

822
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,574
如果你拉一个家人说
if you were pulling a family say

823
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:03,665
政治民意调查就好了
political polling well there would be it

824
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,544
预期会有一些协方差
there would be some covariance expected

825
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:12,794
有两个或三个或五个人
there the two or three or five people

826
00:51:12,799 --> 00:51:14,534
你住在同一栋房子里
that you living in the same house

827
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:17,475
不会完全独立
wouldn't be independent entirely

828
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,364
独立但他们也不会
independent but they nor would they

829
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:23,745
总是说所有五个都给出相同的答案
always say all five give the same answer

830
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,685
因此协方差矩阵将具有
so the covariance matrix would be have

831
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,935
一些非对角线，但它会
some off-diagonal but it would it would

832
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,635
实际上仍然是不可逆的
still be not invertible and actually

833
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,854
我想告诉你下一次
what i want to tell you about next time

834
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:42,584
一开始就是协方差矩阵
at the start is that covariance matrix

835
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:44,594
这是我来定义，你会
which i have to define for you would be

836
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:47,895
将是对称的正定或
will be symmetric positive definite or

837
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,804
或半确定什么是半
or semi definite what's the semi

838
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:53,354
当然是明确的情况
definite case of course that's the case

839
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,745
硬币粘在一起的地方是的
where the coins are glued together yeah

840
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,985
是的，好的，谢谢，那就是你
yeah okay thanks that's that's so you

841
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:02,084
我知道周五会发生什么
know what's coming Friday I know that

842
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:04,905
假期也在周五即将到来
holiday is also coming Friday and just

843
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:10,480
you'll make a good plan and I'll move on

844
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:13,960
你会制定一个好的计划，我会继续前进

845
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,960
休息后好
after the break good
