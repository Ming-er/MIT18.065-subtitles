9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,195
我们应开始我只想说，这是一个
shall we start let me just say this is a

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,515
对我来说是一次伟大的冒险
great adventure for me to be here all on

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,335
我自己教授涉及的课程
my own teaching a course that involves

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,255
从数据中学习，令人兴奋
learning from data so it's exciting

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,585
主题和很多线性代数
subject and a lot of linear algebra goes

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,285
进入它所以这是第二道菜
into it so it's sort of a second course

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,905
在线性代数我可以
in linear algebra can I just

16
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,685
你会知道什么是有恒星的
you'll know what so there is a stellar

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,074
网站建立，将成为
site established and that will be the

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,855
我们使用这个基本的东西是公众
basic thing that we use this is a public

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,005
网站方法mit.edu
site method mit.edu

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,985
从数据中学习，所以有一本书
learning from data and so a book is

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,795
未来很快，因为我们说话或
coming pretty quickly as we speak or

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,245
在我们发言之后，那个网站就有了
after we speak and that site has the

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,105
这本书的目录
table of contents of the book which

24
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,355
会让你知道可能是什么
would give you an idea of what could be

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,055
在课程中，我和我打印出一个
in the course and I and I printed out a

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,785
只为那一页的每个人复制
copy for everybody just of that one page

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,035
这可能是最后的第一个也是最后一个
that's probably the final first and last

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,085
可能与表的讲义
handout maybe with with the table of

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,415
你会在那里看到的内容
contents which you'll see there and also

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,695
你会看到前两个部分
you'll see there the first two sections

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,855
这本书的是什么，我会跟
of the book which is what I'll talk

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,915
关于今天和一点点
about today and and on a little bit in

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,154
到星期五，这是线性的
to Friday so that's that's linear

34
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,864
代数当然是因为课程
algebra of course because the course

35
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,095
有点从线性代数开始
sort of begins with linear algebra

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,474
实际上你会知道的事情
actually things that you would know from

37
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,245
1806但是你这是一种说法
1806 but you but this is a way to say

38
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,515
这是非常重要的事情
this is really important stuff so that's

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,984
我今天要做什么我想做点什么
what I'll do today I'd like to do some

40
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,925
从今天的线性代数开始
start on the linear algebra today

41
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,925
这是关于这个的重要事实
and here's the great facts about the

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,615
当然至少我们知道有这样的我们
course at least we knew there were so we

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,745
去年我们几个人教过它
taught it last year several of us

44
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,704
在一起，我们知道不会有
together and we knew there wouldn't be a

45
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,615
期末考试，但我们想象有可能
final exam but we imagined there might

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,035
一路上是测验但是我们
be quizzes along the way but then we

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,594
想不出什么可以穿上的
couldn't think of anything to put on the

48
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,044
测验，所以我们取消了那些，但你做了
quizzes so we canceled those but you do

49
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:45,255
尽管如此，我还是学到了很多东西
learn a lot nevertheless and so I guess

50
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,434
我们立足档次的家庭作业等等
we base the grades on the homeworks so

51
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,164
作业将是部分线性的
the homeworks will be partly linear

52
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:55,965
代数问题，部分在线你
algebra questions and partly online you

53
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,594
知道像识别手写
know like recognizing handwriting

54
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,225
将图像拼接在一起很多其他
stitching images together many other

55
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,624
事情，我会像我们一样谈论这些事情
things and I'll talk about those as we

56
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,954
好吧是的
go right good yeah

57
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,055
所以这就是一般情况和
so this that's the general picture and

58
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,704
今天我会说更多，我可以
I'll say more about it today and I could

59
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,444
回答任何关于它的问题所以我们是
answer any question about it so we're

60
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:22,335
录像带，如果有人的话
getting videotaped so if anybody's

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,965
害羞地坐在远处，但它会
bashful sit at the far back but it'll be

62
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,844
有趣的是啊，你可知道视频
fun yeah you may know the videos for

63
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,194
1806所以这就像下一步1806
1806 so this is like the next step 1806

64
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,324
五，这对我来说非常令人兴奋
five that's pretty exciting for me so

65
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,305
任何问题或我应该做一些数学
any question or shall I do a little math

66
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,874
为什么不然后我会说一个
why not and then and then I'll say a

67
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,074
多一点对课程只是让你
little more about the course just so you

68
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,134
知道前方是什么，是的
have an idea of what what's ahead yeah

69
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,145
它看起来就像这个房间
and it looks like this room is exactly

70
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,245
对我来说合适的尺寸所以我很高兴
the right size to me so I'm pleased okay

71
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:10,414
那么线性代数的交易是什么呢？
so so what's the deal in linear algebra

72
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,474
如果我开始的话，让我开始原谅我
let me I'll start forgive me if I start

73
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,264
与我做的第一天
with what I do the very first day in

74
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,024
1806将矩阵乘以a
1806 which is multiply a matrix by a

75
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,105
矢量然后我就毕业
vector and then I'll graduate to

76
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,755
将矩阵乘以5月
multiplying a matrix by a May

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,185
这样的技巧，你会说我知道
tricks so that and you will say I know

78
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,885
那些东西，但你知道它是正确的
that stuff but do you know it the right

79
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,655
你说，乘法
way do you think of the multiplication

80
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,145
正确的方式让我告诉你我的意思
the right way so let me tell you what I

81
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,725
相信是正确的做法太让我
believe to be the right way so let me

82
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:48,405
拿一个矩阵说两三五一一
take a matrix say two three five one one

83
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,145
七，三四十二好吧
seven and three four twelve okay and

84
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:02,595
我总是把矩阵称为好
I'll always call matrices a okay so

85
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,975
第一步只是X次的一次
first step is just a times X a times a

86
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,695
矢量所以我乘以a乘以说x1
vector so I multiply a a by let's say x1

87
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,385
x2x3以及如何查看答案
x2 x3 and how do I look at that answer

88
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,805
所以选择是想想行
so the choice is think of the rows of

89
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,215
矩阵或想到列和
the matrix or think of the columns and

90
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,465
如果你想到的行是
if you think of the rows which is the

91
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,885
标准的乘法方式
standard way to multiply you would take

92
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,885
点积，因此第一种方式是
the dot product so the first way is the

93
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:41,775
第一种方式是RowRow的点积
first way is dot product of Row Row

94
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,565
点缀着X右2X1加X2plus
dotted with X right 2 X 1 plus X 2 plus

95
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,595
3X3它给你答案a
3 X 3 it gives you the answer a

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,215
组件在低级别的时间
component at a time that's the low level

97
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,845
看待它的好方法就是矢量
way the good way to see it is vector

98
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,775
明智地看到这个X1倍增
wise see this as X 1 multiplies that

99
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:10,175
第一列X是第二列的2倍
first column X 2 times the second column

100
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,145
117和X3倍于第三列34
1 1 7 and X 3 times the third column 3 4

101
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,445
12
12

102
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,065
好，所以它是矢量的组合
good so it's a combination of vectors

103
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,345
当然它会产生一个矢量和
and of course it produces a vector and

104
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,115
在这里，我们有一个三点矩阵和三个
here we have a three by three matrix and

105
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,745
我们的载体在r3和大多数载体中
our vectors are in r3 and most vectors

106
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,925
将在R3或RN本课程使
will be in r3 or RN for this course so

107
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,605
这是正确的答案，当然
that's the right answer and of course

108
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,735
第一个分量是2X1+1X2+3
the first component is 2 X 1 + 1 X 2 + 3

109
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,455
X3相同的213相同的点积
X 3 the same 2 1 3 the same dot product

110
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,035
出来正确，但你看它就像排序
comes out right but you see it like sort

111
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,245
各一次，而不是零碎所以
of all at once instead of piecemeal so

112
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,915
那是你知道课程的一部分我
that's you know part of the course I

113
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,435
猜猜我希望得到的部分内容
guess part of what I hope to get across

114
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,765
正在考虑矩阵矩阵作为
is thinking of a matrix of a matrix as a

115
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,345
整件事不仅仅是一堆9或者
whole thing not just a bunch of 9 or or

116
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,225
M乘以n个数字，但将其视为
M times n numbers but thinking of it as

117
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,055
a矩阵乘以a
a as a thing a matrix multiplies a

118
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,775
向量给另一个向量是的想
vector to give another vector yeah think

119
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,575
所以，当我说斧头你
so that when I say ax that you

120
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,575
马上立刻想到你
immediately think that you immediately

121
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,845
认为好的斧头有一个明确的含义它是一个
think okay ax has a clear meaning it's a

122
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,795
现在这样的列的组合
combination of the columns of a so now

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,755
让我采取下一步和下一步
let me take that next step and the next

124
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,985
步骤是考虑所有的组合
step is think about all combinations of

125
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,835
我们采用矩阵a的列
the columns of a we take the matrix a

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,005
我们采取所有的X，我们想象所有
and we take all X's and we imagine all

127
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,765
输出和我想问你的意思
the outputs and what I want to ask you

128
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,765
是是什么样子，如果我只是
is what does that look like if I just

129
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,215
取1X1向量XI得到一个向量
take 1 X 1 vector X I get a vector

130
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,515
输出将矢量传递给矢量但是
output takes a vector to a vector but

131
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,755
现在我把所有的X都拿走了
now I take all X's the hole all of

132
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,355
矢量X在3d中或在3d中我得到了所有
vectors X in or in 3d and I get all

133
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,055
这些答案我想起了所有这些
these answers and I think of them all

134
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,465
在一起，所以我有一堆
together and so I've got a bunch of

135
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,895
实际上向量无限多个向量
vectors infinitely many vectors actually

136
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,885
问题是如果我绘制那些
and the question is what if I plot those

137
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,955
无限多的向量我有什么
infinitely many vectors what do I have

138
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,745
线性代数的美妙之处在于
and the beauty of linear algebra is that

139
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,305
像这样的问题
questions like this

140
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,164
你可以回答他们，他们就是你
you can answer them and they you

141
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,515
直观地看到你肯定会看到它
intuitively see it you certainly see it

142
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,065
在3D中，你有权利和
in 3d and you kind of have the right and

143
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,605
正确的想法甚至十个维度
the right idea in ten dimensions even

144
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,545
虽然我们大多数人看不太清楚
though most of us don't see too well in

145
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,565
在我们的10中10D但在这里我们得到了3个
10 D in our 10 but here we got three

146
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,285
好的，所以你看到我在说什么
okay so so do you see what I'm saying

147
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:05,625
我现在把所有的X都拿走，所以一切都是X.
I'm taking all X's so now so all a X

148
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,215
给了我们一大堆矢量和那些
gives us a big bunch of vectors and that

149
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,095
载体的集合称为
collection of vectors is called the

150
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,325
它的列空间是其他的空间
column space of a it's a space in other

151
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,625
这是那里的关键词
words that that's the keyword there the

152
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,315
a的列空间，我只会写它
column space of a and I'll just write it

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,665
当我需要一封信的时候，作为一个C的
as C of a when I need a letters for it

154
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,435
好的，所以我会问你是做什么的
okay so I'm going to ask you what does

155
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,005
这个列空间看起来像那样
this column space look like and that

156
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,375
有时取决于矩阵
depends on the matrix sometimes the

157
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,725
列空间将是整个r3
column space would be the whole of r3

158
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,475
有时它是r3或更小的一组
sometimes it's a smaller set in r3 or

159
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,345
空间
space

160
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,834
你知道在这种情况下它是什么吗？
do you know what it is in this case do I

161
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,795
得到我从这些家伙得到所有的3D
get do I get all of 3d out of these guys

162
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,084
通过选择所有X1和X2以及X3
by choosing all X 1 and X 2 and X 3 it

163
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,475
似乎它是一个随机矩阵
seemed like if it was a random matrix

164
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,495
答案肯定是肯定的，如果
the answer would be surely yes if the

165
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,575
随机3x3矩阵是它的列空间
random 3x3 matrix is its column space is

166
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,275
将成为我们三个栏目中的所有栏目
going to be all of our three its columns

167
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,795
将是独立的行
are going to be independent its rows are

168
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,415
将会是独立的
going to be independent it's going to be

169
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,265
可逆的它会变得很棒但是
invertible it's going to be great but is

170
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,075
这个矩阵是什么与基质回事
this matrix what's up with that matrix

171
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,334
不，这不对
no it's not right

172
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,084
所以我得到了什么，而不是我们所有的
so what do I get instead of all of our

173
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,435
三，如果你得到那架飞机，我会得到一架飞机
three I get a plane yeah if you get that

174
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,215
在望所以采取所有X
in sight so by taking all X's

175
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,145
每个人都和我在一起所有X都是如此
everybody's with me all X's here so so

176
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,245
这意味着像它填充
that means that like it fills in

177
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,545
无论如何，因为它是线性的
whatever and well because it's linear

178
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,295
代数它可能会成为我们所有人
algebra it's gonna be likely all of our

179
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,105
三
three

180
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,215
是什么让我的飞机甚至是一条线
or a plane or even a line what let me

181
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,005
在这里揍一会儿
just bat over here for a moment

182
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,815
给我一个矩阵，其中的
give me a matrix which would whose

183
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,625
列空间只是一行
column space would only be a line all

184
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,095
一个人还好，哇，这让我活了下来
one's okay wow that's a let me liven it

185
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,925
上三点三三八
up a little three three three eight

186
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:19,014
八，八我觉得还好，所以我想
eight eight I think okay so I think that

187
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,115
这些列的组合是
the combinations of those columns are

188
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,685
所有在同一条线上看起来就是这样
all on the same line look that says that

189
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,045
列空间只是一行而我
the column space is just a line and I

190
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,355
然后会说矩阵这么一个
would say then that the matrix so a

191
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,704
这个a的列空间是另一行
column space of this a is a line another

192
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,195
我可以说这就是排名
way I could say this is that the rank of

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,475
矩阵是等级的一种
the matrix is one the rank is sort of

194
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,565
列空间的维度很好
the dimension of the column space well

195
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,574
不排序的，这就是它是排名
not sort of that's what it is the rank

196
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,195
在塔的尺寸看
is the dimension of the column see

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,905
每个人都看到你得到一条线
everybody sees that you get a line

198
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,935
因为任何组合x1加上
because any combination x1 of that plus

199
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,875
其中x2加x3即将发生
x2 of that plus x3 of that is is going

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,595
沿着这条线进入这里是
to go in in along that line here's the

201
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,815
第一列是第二列
first column here's the second column

202
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,334
他们都在一条线上所以我永远不会得到
they're all on a line so I'll never get

203
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,425
如果我允许所有的X，那就离开那条线
off that line if I allow all X's I'll

204
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,565
得到整条线
get the whole line

205
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,215
现在在这里你说的不是正确的
now here you said not a line right what

206
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,074
这是什么是列空间
was what was the column space for this

207
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,144
帅哥现在为什么不是我们所有人
guy plain now why isn't it all of our

208
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:24,055
三，你看到了什么是什么
three what what is what do you see that

209
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,105
特别的，因为它很特别
special there because it is special

210
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,334
这使得列空间变得有点像
that's making the column space sort of

211
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:34,704
特别是飞机而不是整体
special a plane instead of the whole

212
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,795
事情是的，这三个是怎么回事
thing yeah what's up with these three

213
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,985
列第三列是总和
columns the third column is the sum of

214
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,204
这两个这样的第一列是罚款
these two so the first column is fine to

215
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,115
3/5秒列是不同的
3/5 second column is in a different

216
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,635
方向，当我采取组合
direction and when I take combinations

217
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,415
我会得到前两列的内容
of the first two columns what will I get

218
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,155
很抱歉继续问你的问题但是
sorry to keep asking your questions but

219
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,845
就是这样
that's that's

220
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,055
反正这是我一直做下去，从而使
anyway that's what I always do so so so

221
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,035
毛皮是那些第一组合
the fur the combinations of those first

222
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,085
两列是一架飞机，因为它们是
two columns are a plane because they're

223
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,155
在不同的人看到的那种
in different everybody kind of sees that

224
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,705
图片我们已经有一列了
picture we've got one column one going

225
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,475
那样，叫他们走那条路
that way and call them to go in that way

226
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,665
然后，如果我采取任何倍数
and then if I take any multiple of

227
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,035
列一个我有一整行的任何
column one I've got a whole line any

228
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,285
第二列的倍数然后当我
multiple of column two and then when I

229
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,155
把它们放在一起就填满了
put the two together it fills in the

230
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,515
填写飞机是的，是的，我们的耳朵
fills in the plane yeah yeah our ear

231
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,665
直觉说这是对的所以这是一个
intuition says that's right so this is a

232
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,605
排名矩阵是什么排名
matrix of rank what's the rank of this

233
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,745
矩阵二，因为它有两个
matrix two because it's got two

234
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,295
独立的列，但第三列
independent columns but the third column

235
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,635
是依赖第三列是
is dependent the third column is a

236
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,975
这是其他人的组合
combination of the others so this is

237
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,715
像这样的矩阵真的是
matrices like this are really the

238
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,515
线性代数的构建块
building blocks of linear algebra

239
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,585
它们是数据的构建块
they're the building blocks of data

240
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,065
科学他们是一个矩阵和
science they're rank one matrices and

241
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,345
让我告诉你一个特殊的方式来思考
let me show you a special way to think

242
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,415
写下我认为的那些排名第一的矩阵
write those rank one matrices I think of

243
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,325
该矩阵作为列向量111次
this matrix as column vector 1 1 1 times

244
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,355
行向量138所以它是一列
the row vector 1 3 8 so it's a column

245
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,745
乘以排名第一的矩阵
times a row that's a rank one matrix do

246
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,605
你知道这是真的
you see that it's a that's a true

247
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,315
乘法它看起来有点
multiplication there it looks a little

248
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,775
奇怪，但它是一个三个矩阵
weird but it's a three by one matrix

249
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,375
乘以这些数字的1乘3矩阵
times a 1 by 3 matrix these numbers have

250
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,325
是相同的，然后输出是3
to be the same and then the output is 3

251
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:46,955
3，就是这样，你看到了它
by 3 and it's that and you see that it

252
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,075
因此，我将继续这样做
factors so I'm going to move on to that

253
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,025
想法下一个想法即将到来
idea the next idea coming up will be

254
00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:02,525
我们可以很好地看到那个
that that we we can see well that's

255
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,705
即将到来，我们将看到矩阵
coming that we're going to see matrices

256
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:09,425
有两个因素好吧让我让我
in with two factors okay let me let me

257
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,455
移动到那，但他们回来了
move to that but but they're back for

258
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,375
这个原始矩阵
this original matrix

259
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:20,195
好吧，这个专栏是什么
okay so what's with this the column

260
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,825
如果我现在想的话，空间就是一架飞机
space is a plane so if I think about now

261
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,305
独立列的关键思想如何
the key idea of independent columns how

262
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,535
我来到这里有很多独立专栏
many independent columns have I got here

263
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,795
如果我想要更正到第三列
to correct to the third column if I want

264
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,805
特别挑选那个，所以我
to especially pick on that one so I

265
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,715
经常从左到右，所以我会说
often go left to right so I'll say the

266
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,325
第一个家伙的好第二个人的好
first guy's good second guy's good the

267
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,565
第三个家伙不是独立的
third guy not is not independent of the

268
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,355
其他所以我只有两个独立的
others so I just have two independent

269
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,225
列和那些是那两列
columns and those are those two columns

270
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,085
这将是列空间的基础
would be a basis for the column space so

271
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,515
这就像是关键的想法
that's the like the critical idea of

272
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,315
你计算的线性代数
linear algebra that's what you compute

273
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,165
与你找到一个基础和每一个
with you find a basis and and every

274
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,025
列空间中的东西是一个
thing in the column space is a

275
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,195
包括那些在内的这些组合
combination of these including that is

276
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,055
这也已经是一个组合了
also that's already a combination of

277
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,125
除了列中的其他所有内容
those but everything else in the column

278
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,335
空间是这两者的组合所以
space is a combination of those two so

279
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,555
所以有一个基础可以，所以你有
so there a basis for it okay so you have

280
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,925
你有这个想法的时代X的想法
the idea of a times X you have the idea

281
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,725
允许所有XS的列空间
of column space of a which allows all XS

282
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,375
那么现在我们正在进入这个想法
then now we're moving into the idea of

283
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,795
独立列和数量
independent columns and the number of

284
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,245
独立柱是为秩如此
independent columns is is the rank so

285
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,055
我应该把这个等级写在某个地方
the rank shall I write that somewhere

286
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,125
也许这里的排名是多少
maybe here the rank is the number of

287
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:00,625
独立专栏
independent columns

288
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,605
而现在这是什么意思的
and right now what do I mean by

289
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,245
独立专栏让我们看看
independent columns well let's just see

290
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,924
通过使用它意味着什么呢？
what that means by by using it are we

291
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,304
好我知道我在这里回顾但是
good I'm I know I'm reviewing here but

292
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,664
请允许我参加第一堂课和第一堂课
allow me for this first class and part

293
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,914
下次还要复习，但你会
of next time also to review but you'll

294
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,074
看到一些新的事实为什么我们不看
see something new fact why don't we see

295
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:29,885
马上就有新东西让我跟随
something new right away let me follow

296
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,674
上现出了独立的想法
up on the idea of Independence in a

297
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:39,325
系统的方式所以这里是我的矩阵一个罐头
systematic way so here's my matrix a can

298
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,765
我再写两三五一
I write that again two three five one

299
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,395
一七，这家伙是他的总和
one seven and this guy was the sum of

300
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,125
那些好了，所以这是我的矩阵确定，所以
those okay so that's my matrix a ok so

301
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,995
让我们从头开始，找到一个
let's start from scratch and find a

302
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,544
中的列空间的基础
basis for the column space in in the

303
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,635
最自然的方式，所以我要带
most natural way so I'm going to take a

304
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,044
基础我会找到什么基础a
basis I'm going to what's a basis a

305
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:13,924
基础是独立的列所以
basis is independent columns so all

306
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:16,985
三个一起不会成为基础而是
three together would not be a basis but

307
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,804
必须不仅仅是独立的
there have to be not just independent

308
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,965
但他们必须填补空间
but but they have to fill the space

309
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,735
他们的组合必须填补
their combinations have to fill the

310
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,025
所以二三五可以让我们这么说
space so so two three five can let's say

311
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,235
我想创建一个我称之为的基础
I want to create a basis I'll call the

312
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,505
矩阵C的列的列的基础
matrix C column a basis for the column

313
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,965
空间，所以这是一个自然的方式来做到这一点我
space so here's a natural way to do it I

314
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,005
看看第一列它不是零
look at the first column it's not zeros

315
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,975
如果它全是零我不想要那个
if it was all zeros I wouldn't want that

316
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,605
在一个基础上但不是我把它放进去
in a basis but it's not so I put it in

317
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,924
这是我基础中的第一个向量
so that's the first vector in my basis

318
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:59,135
如果，我继续进入第二列
then I go on to the second column if

319
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,245
那个专栏是四点六十分
that column was four six ten what would

320
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,664
如果第二列是四六，那我就这样做
I do if that second column was four six

321
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,225
十，我会把它放在基础上，但是
ten would I put it in the basis no but

322
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,475
一个七个就可以了
one one seven is okay right one one

323
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,195
七是
seven is

324
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,665
不同的方向它不是一个
different direction it's not a

325
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,515
什么，我们已经有了这样的组合
combination of what we've already got so

326
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,155
我说好的，增加了新的东西
I say okay that adds something new put

327
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,705
然后我转到第三栏
it in then I move on to the third column

328
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,185
我把它放在你知道的基础上
do I put that into a basis you know the

329
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,245
答案现在没有，因为我期待
answer by now no because I'm looking to

330
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,215
看到这是这些家伙的组合
see is it a combination of these guys

331
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,085
它是其中之一
and it is it's one of that plus one of

332
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,185
所以它不是独立的，所以我
that so it's not independent so I've

333
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,185
我现在已经完成了我有一个矩阵C.
I've finished now I've got a matrix C

334
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,955
这就像直接从a和
which was like taken directly from a and

335
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,295
我只保留了独立的列和我
I kept only independent columns and I

336
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,045
从左到右工作，我可以看到
worked from left to right and I can see

337
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,285
这马上现在的等级是
that right away now that the rank is to

338
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,465
列列我应该说列
the column rank I should say the column

339
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,195
排名一些独立的列是
rank a number of independent columns is

340
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:20,195
太好了，现在是我要走的关键一步
too good now comes a key step I'm gonna

341
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:27,365
产生第三个正在进行的矩阵R.
produce a third matrix R which is going

342
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,225
告诉我如何从这些列中获取这些列
to tell me how to get these columns from

343
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,395
这些列及其形状将会发生
these columns and its shape is going to

344
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,615
做好它的形状我没有
be well its shape I don't have any

345
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,655
选择这是3乘2所以R必须是
choice this is 3 by 2 so R has to be to

346
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,085
买东西，所以我喜欢我
buy something so so so I'm like so I

347
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,035
猜猜它必须是2比3，因为我想要
guess it has to be 2 by 3 because I want

348
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,505
以这种方式出现2乘3我是什么
to come out this way 2 by 3 what am I

349
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,655
要在这里做，我只是要投入
gonna do here I'm just going to put in

350
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,235
这些数字是正确的
the numbers are that make this correct

351
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,655
所以这是第一个矩阵分解
so this is a first matrix factorization

352
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,025
它不是很好，它是一个着名的
it's not well it is a famous one

353
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,705
实际上，当我们看到它时，我们会认出来
actually when we see it we'll recognize

354
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,115
它是什么，它是，但它出名了
what it is it's but it's famous in

355
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,275
现在教授近代数
teaching the near algebra but now

356
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,515
实际上看时间是列时间
actually see times are columns times

357
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,605
行已经变得非常重要了
rows has become very very important in

358
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,414
大规模数值线性代数
large scale numerical linear algebra

359
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:33,235
是的，让我们弄清楚会发生什么
yeah so let's figure out what goes into

360
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,935
我们还好，所以我在做什么
our okay so what's going in what am I

361
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,384
想在这里我把我们的那
thinking here I'm putting in our that

362
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:45,024
tel所以这些列中的每一列都是
tel so every one of these columns is a

363
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:46,884
这些就是整体的组合
combination of these that's the whole

364
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,524
我只想把它放进去
point and I'm just going to put in the

365
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:52,884
你需要的数字，以便进行什么
numbers that you need so what goes in

366
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:55,585
我们的第一列是什么
the first column of our what goes in the

367
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,075
我们的第一栏，所以我想看看
first column of our so I want to look

368
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,374
那个专栏和那个专栏的组合
what combination of that column and that

369
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:05,685
专栏给了我这一个是零
column gives me this one yeah one zero

370
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:12,195
一零，因为你记得我们是怎样的
one zero because you remember how we

371
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,855
当I时，将矩阵乘以向量
multiply a matrix by a vector when I

372
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,835
将该矩阵乘以该向量I.
multiply that matrix by that vector I

373
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,715
取其中一个加零，我看到了
take one of this plus zero of that I see

374
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,384
它是矢量明智的，当然我明白了
it vector wise and of course I get it

375
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:27,235
对，第二栏怎么样？
right and what about the second column

376
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,115
的R所以第二列应是
of R so the second column should be the

377
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,935
产生第二个的组合
combination that produces the second

378
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,894
正确的列将是什么
column of a correctly what will that be

379
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:40,735
零谢谢，最后是第三个
zero one thanks and finally the third

380
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,674
第一栏是的，因为其中之一
column one one yes right because one of

381
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,894
加上其中一个产生第三个
this plus one of this produces the third

382
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:52,524
所以我所做的一切都放在了
column so so all I did was put in the

383
00:22:52,529 --> 00:23:04,904
正确的数字真的是对的
right numbers there really right and

384
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:09,835
这是正确的，现在SC乘以R等等
this is correct now a SC times R and so

385
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,075
这就像我在这里所做的那样
that's this is like what I've done here

386
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,164
就像前两页一节
is like the first two pages of section

387
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:27,054
这些说明中的1.1如此1.1和实际上
1.1 in these notes so 1.1 and actually

388
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,865
所以我直截了当地告诉你发生了什么
so I tell you literally what happened

389
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,975
今年早些时候我希望我写这个
earlier this year I wish this I wrote I

390
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,274
用另一个例子写下来
wrote this down with a different example

391
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,164
然后我意识到了那个
and then I realized something that that

392
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:47,604
坐在我面前的是
sitting here in front of me was the

393
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,825
线性代数中的第一个大定理
first great theorem in linear algebra

394
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,685
列等于等于的事实
the fact that the column rank equals the

395
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,734
排名如果我有一个事实
row rank the fact that if I have a

396
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:04,945
矩阵，那列加上那个
matrix where that column plus that

397
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,884
专栏给了那一个哦，我是什么
column gives that one oh so what am I

398
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:12,744
要说这里我变得紧张
going to say here I'm getting nervous

399
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:16,494
我相信它的组合
about it I believe that a combination of

400
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:21,264
行给出0你相信我吗？
the rows gives 0 do you believe that I

401
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:22,974
意味着你必须相信它，这是像
mean you got to believe it this is like

402
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:25,854
矩阵不是线性代数
a linear algebra the matrix is not

403
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:30,205
可逆的是方形而是列
invertible it's square but the columns

404
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,325
是依赖所以行必须是
are dependent so the rows have to be

405
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,604
依赖，我不完全看到我
dependent and I don't exactly see I

406
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,674
那个行和。的某种组合
there's some combination of that row and

407
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,404
该行中给出了一个，当我
that row that gives that one and when I

408
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:44,935
当然，当我看第一个
of course when I looked at the first

409
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,094
专栏中，我想确定它的将是
column I thought ok it's going to be

410
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,514
这将成为其中的太容易了一个
it's going to be too easy one of that

411
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,094
其中一个给了那个，但后来我的
and one of that gives that but then my I

412
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,494
我去了第二栏
went over to the second column and I

413
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:58,584
意识到这根本不容易，所以你是
realize it's not easy at all so you're

414
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:02,455
有权拿出你的手机
entitled to pull out a your phone and

415
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,394
想出这个，但有一些该死的
figure this out but there is some damn

416
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:09,084
这两行的组合
combination of those of those two rows

417
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,575
它给人的第三排它的，否则
it gives the third row it's otherwise

418
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,935
就像课程结束我们停下来但很好
like the course is over we stop but well

419
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,695
也许我们会找到它或以某种方式
maybe we're gonna find it or somehow

420
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,344
是啊是啊所以所以这是这是
yeah yeah so so that's this is the

421
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,164
定理，所以我必须告诉你我
theorem so I so I have to tell you I

422
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:30,114
意思是你知道我真的很高兴
mean you know I was like really pleased

423
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,144
所以前两页还有两个
so the first two pages got two more

424
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:36,474
页面跟进那个想法
pages to follow up on that idea that

425
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:38,274
在这里我们看到的东西，我
here we were seeing something that I

426
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:43,065
有点证明在1806年，但你不知道
sort of proved in 1806 but not you know

427
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,744
没有在第一讲这是肯定的
not in the first lecture that's for sure

428
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:49,705
而且我现在也许不是那么清楚
and I'm not not maybe so clearly but now

429
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,105
我可以尝试证明这一点
I can I try to prove it

430
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,745
某某，所以这里不会有
so and so here's the there won't be a

431
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,774
这个课程中有很多证明，但这是
lot of proofs in this class but this is

432
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,894
这样一个重要的事实是等于CR
such an important fact a equals CR is

433
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,835
重要的分解和出
important factorization and and out of

434
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,255
它我们可以连接它们，所以我是什么
it we can connect them so what am I

435
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:14,475
说我就是那么说的
saying I'm saying that all that that

436
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,054
那排是什么排排名是啊
that the row so what's the row rank yeah

437
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,664
我可以回到这里，这是什么行
I could go back up here what's the row

438
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:24,625
排行什么是行空间所以行
rank what's the row space so the row

439
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,845
排名将是明确的
rank is going to be the definite the

440
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,294
那个空间的尺寸让我看看
dimension of that space so so I look at

441
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:34,995
我矩阵是什么的行空间
my matrix a what's the row space of a

442
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,565
我现在可能会看看它的行
I'm gonna look at its rows now maybe

443
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,565
所以我们没有得到一个全新的信件
just so we don't get a whole new letters

444
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:47,455
对于那里的行空间我是给我的
for the row space there I'm for me the

445
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,884
的一个矩阵的行的空间，以便所以第一
row space of a of a matrix so so first

446
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:55,365
所有这些都用语言告诉我它是什么
of all tell me in words what it is

447
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,884
什么是矩阵的行空间
what's the row space of the matrix all

448
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:04,884
所有行的组合
combinations of the rows all

449
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,005
这些行的组合
combinations of the rows that's the

450
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,725
太空所以我会采取所有组合
space so I would take all combinations

451
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,205
那些行来获得组合
of those rows to get combinations of the

452
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,115
我有两种方法可以获得
rows I well two ways I can get

453
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,914
行和方式的组合
combinations of the rows and the way

454
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,144
我会这样做的
I'll do it is

455
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:25,495
我只是将矩阵转置为那些
I'll just transpose the matrix so those

456
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,164
行变为列，然后我回来
rows become columns and then I'm back to

457
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,095
我做了什么，所以a的行空间是
what I did so the row space of a is the

458
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:37,195
转置的列空间和这个
column space of a transpose and and this

459
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,085
我们没有优势
has the advantage that we don't

460
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,414
介绍一封新信，这样就可以了
introduce a new letter so it's it'll be

461
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:48,235
转置的列空间，所以我们
the column space of a transpose so we

462
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,995
不要介绍我们保留的新信
don't introduce a new letter we keep the

463
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,705
传统是列的惯例
convention that vectors are column

464
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,644
矢量将是MATLAB和
vectors which would be the MATLAB and

465
00:27:55,649 --> 00:28:03,985
和朱莉娅和Python的惯例是这样的
and Julia and Python convention so is

466
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,265
没关系
that okay

467
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,945
行空间是组合
the row space is the combination of

468
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,615
这些行，但我会翻转我会做出来的
these rows but I'll flip i'll make them

469
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,555
站起来21322B列向量所以
stand up 2 1 3 2 2 B column vectors so

470
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,765
这是一个完全不同的空间，
it's a totally different space and

471
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,105
实际上在我身上我碰巧拿3乘3
actually in my I happen to take a 3 by 3

472
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,635
示例，以便列空间是一部分
example so that the column space is part

473
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,695
我们的三个和行空间也是
of our three and the row space is also

474
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,795
我们三个的一部分，因为我的矩阵是
part of our three because my matrix is

475
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,235
三个三个更好的例子我的意思
three by three a better example I mean

476
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,185
并且数据数据的整个点没有
and the whole point of data data doesn't

477
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,635
进来方阵幸运的
come in square matrices fortunately for

478
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,035
我们的数据非常经常出现
us data very very often comes in

479
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,505
矩阵，但列可能是
matrices but the to the columns might be

480
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,715
采样可能是患者和行
sampled might be patients and the rows

481
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,285
可能是疾病或我的意思
might be diseases or something I mean

482
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,125
他们是不同的空间
they're they're different spaces so

483
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:04,005
矩阵不太可能是方形的，但
matrices are not likely to be square but

484
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,455
无论如何我们在这里很好没关系，所以
anyway we're good here okay okay so the

485
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,055
行空间
row space

486
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,995
现在我可以回到证明
now now can I come back to the proof

487
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,725
因为我们想说的就是那个
because we what I want to say is that

488
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,275
这个基本事实的证明是
the proof of this fundamental fact is

489
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,245
盯着我们，但我们并没有看到它
staring at us but we don't quite see it

490
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:29,735
然而，我想看到它，所以我声称
yet and I want to see it so I claim that

491
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:38,465
这些行是行空间的基础
these rows are a basis for the row space

492
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:44,285
我们已经看到了这些专栏
and we already saw that these columns

493
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:53,745
我们的列空间基础和两个
our basis for the column space and two

494
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,155
在这里等于两个右两个向量或a
equals two right two vectors here or a

495
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,405
如果可以的话，现在可以用于列空间的基础
basis for the column space now if I can

496
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,835
看看为什么这会告诉我这两个
see why this shows me that these two

497
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,045
向量是行空间的基础
vectors are a basis for the row space

498
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,125
然后我有我的榜样是对的
then then I have my example is right

499
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,955
这两者都会给予
both both of these will give to the

500
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,595
列排名是行的两列
column rank is to two columns the row

501
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,075
等级是两行所以
rank is to two rows so

502
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,215
我必须解释为什么我相信这一点
I have to explain why I believe that

503
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,125
这两行是行的基础
these two rows are a basis for the row

504
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,775
空间权有我，我要证明给
space right with me I have to prove to

505
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,955
当我说的时候，先看看为什么会这样
see why first are there so when I say

506
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,855
我有什么检查基础是
basis what do I have to check basis is

507
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,855
这是我的关键想法
is just is the critical idea it I have

508
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,885
检查他们是独立的，所以我
to check that they're independent so I

509
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,105
没有得到太多的矢量我有
haven't got too many vectors I've got

510
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,745
那里还有任何额外的载体，我也是
any extra vectors in there and I also

511
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,625
必须检查他们的组合
have to check that their combinations

512
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:05,055
如果我这么说就产生所有的行
produce all the rows should I say that

513
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,285
再次那是因为那就是我的意思
again that's because that's what I'm

514
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,875
要检查我会检查
going to check I'm gonna check that

515
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,825
那些家伙很独立，你可以
those guys are independent well you can

516
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,745
看到他们是独立的，我是
see that they're independent and I'm

517
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,385
要检查那是他们的
going to check that the that their

518
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,785
组合产生所有这三个
combinations produce all three of these

519
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:25,845
行如果我们没有创建这些数字
rows if we didn't create those numbers

520
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,575
为了这个目的，但我所说的是
for this purpose but what I'm saying is

521
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,565
他们工作，所以我声称这是一个
they work so I claim that this is a

522
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,955
因为什么组合的基础
basis because what what combination of

523
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,985
那两行会产生这个
those two rows would produce this this

524
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,655
第一排是啊让我问你那个
first row yeah let me just ask you that

525
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,075
什么组合应该是什么数字
what combination what numbers should I

526
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,715
乘这两行通过获得
multiply these two rows by to get the

527
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,025
第一排任何两个，一个和哪里
first row of any two and one and where

528
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,595
你找到两个和一个吗？
do you find two and one

529
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,565
它坐在那里，看看我和我
it's sitting there in see what I'm and

530
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,865
它会再次发挥作用吗？
will it work again does three of this

531
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:11,315
加上其中一个给三个一个是的
plus one of that give three one four yes

532
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,275
到现在为止还挺好
so far so good

533
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,725
其中五个和七个看到了
does five of this and seven of that see

534
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,985
我在成倍增长我想我正在做矩阵
I'm multiplying I guess I'm doing matrix

535
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,205
乘法一种落后的等待
multiplication a sort of backward wait

536
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,685
或者我正在采取不同的方式
or a different different way I'm taking

537
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,265
第二行的组合
combinations of the rows of the second

538
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,635
人这是另一种方式是一个
guy that's another way that one

539
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,685
关于矩阵的小心
careful thing about matrix

540
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,815
乘法是你可以做很多的
multiplication is you can do it a lot of

541
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,485
各种各样的方式和方式
ways it comes out the same every way and

542
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,045
每路告诉你的东西，所以5
each way tells you something so 5 of

543
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,865
那行加上那行的7肯定了
that row plus 7 of that row sure enough

544
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:50,055
在这里，你看到那不是那样的
is here do you see that that is not like

545
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:55,095
事实证明这是真的
accident that that the proof is really

546
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,645
看看这个乘法C次
to look at this multiplication C times

547
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,705
有两种方式首先看它
are two ways look at it first as

548
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,255
C列的组合给出
combinations of columns of C to give the

549
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,285
列看第二个得到它
columns look at it second to get as

550
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,345
R和那些行的组合
combinations of the rows of R and that

551
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,975
生成行以使分解
produces the rows so that factorization

552
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:24,815
等于CR是关键的想法和
a equals C R was what's the key idea and

553
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,495
实际上这是我们想出来的R.
actually this R that we've come up with

554
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,075
有一个名字
has a name

555
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,325
任何人都记得足够1806这里是一个
anybody remember enough 1806 here's a

556
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:40,305
比如你们都花了1806我不是我
like have you all taken 1806 I'm no I

557
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:47,255
看到我们有多少让我们好的好
see us how many have let's yes okay good

558
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,655
有一段时间1806教了一个非常
for a while 1806 was taught in a very

559
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,165
抽象的方式我说的是发生了什么但是
abstract way I said what's going on but

560
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,255
无论如何，如果你在那个学期学习
anyway so if you took it that semester

561
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,015
你可能从未听说过专栏
you maybe never heard of the column

562
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,185
空间我不确定或不同
space I'm not sure or by a different

563
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,985
命名它有另一个名字
name it has another name

564
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,745
列空间的另一个名称是什么
what's its other name the column space

565
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,935
对于矩阵范围，我认为它是范围
of a matrix range I think it's the range

566
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,205
是的，是的，是的，是的，当然
yeah right right yep yep and of course

567
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,625
这一切都是基础
it's all this is fundamental in

568
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,015
数学当然是一切
mathematics so of course it everything

569
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,005
这里有不同的语言和
here is is has different languages and

570
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,275
不同的重点，但你看到了什么
different emphasis but you see what the

571
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,975
重点在这里好，所以你看到了
emphasis is here okay so you see the

572
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,445
证明等于CR只是揭示
proof that a equals C R is just reveals

573
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,315
一切都那么它的第一个想法
everything so it's a first idea of a

574
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,894
矩阵的分解
factorization of a matrix

575
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,945
并且，我们已经看到倍增时间为
and and we've multiplied see times are

576
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,674
现在我可以说因为这样
now I could just say cuz so that's

577
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,195
真的，你已经看到了现在的主力
really you've seen the now the main

578
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,104
部分的音符的1.1的点
point of section 1.1 of the notes to

579
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:01,034
想出那个因素化和那个
come up with that factorization and that

580
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:08,145
结论和，你知道为什么C有
conclusion and and and you see why C has

581
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,185
相同数量的列数
the same number of the number of columns

582
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,675
的C的温度将我们的行数和
of C will the number of rows of our and

583
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,104
这些是列排名和行
those are the column rank and the row

584
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:19,485
排名是的它只是非常整洁和在这里
rank yeah it's just pretty neat and here

585
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,814
是那些专栏的特例
was the special case where those column

586
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:25,304
空间列空间都是倍数
space the column space is all multiples

587
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:28,034
你这一行是排成一行的
of you it's a line through you the row

588
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,034
空间是V的倍数它是一条线
space is all multiples of V it's a line

589
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,215
通过V，这是基本建筑
through V and that's the basic building

590
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,405
阻止是啊我可以再说一点
block yeah can I just say another little

591
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,544
在我超越CR之前的那个词
word before I push on beyond CR that

592
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:46,844
如果你有一个巨人，这就成了
that this has become if you have a giant

593
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,925
矩阵像大小10到五分之一
matrix like size 10 to the fifth that's

594
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,175
你知道你不能把它放进去
that you know you can't put that into

595
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,685
快速记忆你是它的一团糟
fast memory you it's it's it's a mess

596
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,875
你如何处理与大小为10的矩阵
how do you deal with a matrix of size 10

597
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,344
当你无法处理时到第五个
to the fifth when you cannot deal with

598
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:03,725
所有的条目，这只是不
all the entries that that's just not

599
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,324
可能
possible

600
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:09,435
你会因此在后面的样本时
will you sample it so later in the

601
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,774
当然我们会做随机抽样的
course we'll be doing random sampling of

602
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:14,475
一个矩阵，你的样本怎么样？
a matrix so how could your sample a

603
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,104
矩阵，所以你当然有一个矩阵
matrix so you have a matrix of course

604
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,965
你不是在看它，因为但是
you're not looking at it because but

605
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,074
它是你想要得到一些典型的
it's and you want to get some typical

606
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,794
列好吧，这是你的自然想法
columns okay here's the natural idea you

607
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:34,094
当你拿X时，只要看看任何xx
just look at any x x when you take let X

608
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:37,665
是随机向量随机向量R和R.
be a random vector random vector R and R

609
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:43,364
因此它有M行和一列
and of so it's got M rows and one column

610
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:50,804
这是一个载体，我能说些什么
it's a vector and what can I say about

611
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,195
斧头
ax

612
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,095
它位于列空间的空间中
it's in what spaces it in column space

613
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,255
谢谢，这是第一个想法
thanks that was the first idea in this

614
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,615
在这个讲座中，ax就在专栏中
in this lecture ax is in the column

615
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,745
空间，所以如果你想要一个随机向量
space so if you want a random vector in

616
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,025
列空间我不建议它
the column space I wouldn't suggest it

617
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,325
只需随机选择其中一列
just randomly pick one of the columns

618
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,535
最好采取混合列
better to take a mixture of columns by

619
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,815
采取随机向量X，看着
taking a random vector X and looking at

620
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,365
看着斧头，如果你想要一个
looking at ax and if you wanted a

621
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,985
一百个随机向量你
hundred random vectors you take a

622
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,335
一百个随机X和那将给
hundred random X's and that would give

623
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,425
在很多情况下你都是个好主意
you a pretty good idea in many cases of

624
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,335
列空间看起来是什么样的
what what the column space looks like

625
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,185
这足以经常使用
that would be enough to work with often

626
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,265
是的好的我可以直接投入
yeah okay okay can I just throw in

627
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:42,105
另一个问题，所以斧头就在
another question so so ax is in the

628
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,865
列空间让我问你
column space of a let me just ask you

629
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:52,725
这个问题是ABCX就是在
this question is is ABC X is that in the

630
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,545
我有一个假设的列空间
column space of a suppose I have

631
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,775
矩阵aB和C以及向量X和I.
matrices a B and C and a vector X and I

632
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,205
拿他们的产品那样给我
take their product does that give me

633
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,955
在列空间中的某些东西是肯定的
something in the column space of a yes

634
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,535
对你有好处为什么你怎么知道
good for you why how do you know that

635
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:16,305
没错这就是一个时间正确的事情把
yeah it's a time something right putting

636
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,225
在正确的地方括号是
parentheses in the right place is the

637
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,235
线性代数的关键，他们没关系
key to linear algebra and they're okay

638
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,885
这是一个问题，只是发生在我身上和
it's a question just occurred to me and

639
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,925
我想好了，我想知道你是否这样做
I thought well I wonder if you'd do it

640
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:32,475
好的，所以我们还有时间成倍增加
okay so we have still time to multiply

641
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,655
矩阵哦我会说C
matrices oh I was going to say about C

642
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,245
和R所以这些是来自a的真实列
and R so these are real columns from a

643
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:45,105
但R是不直接采取的行
but R is the rows are not taken directly

644
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,595
从一排实际上有一个
from the rows of a actually there's a

645
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,295
这个名称叫做行
name for this it's called the row

646
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,325
减少矩阵的梯形和
reduced echelon form of the matrix and

647
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:58,455
这是一个很大的目标，在1806年它有
it's a big goal in in 1806 it has the

648
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,045
那里的身份然后另一个
identity there and then the other

649
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,645
专栏告诉你正确的
columns are tell you the right

650
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:10,055
组合yepyep另一个大
combinations yep yep another big

651
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,575
分解将采取列
factorization would be to take columns

652
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,805
从一个所以这是另一个所以我会
from from a so this is another so I'll

653
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:23,805
也许或者我们不会这样做
put maybe or and we won't be doing this

654
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,415
一个月
for a month

655
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,465
我们可以开始列列
we could start take columns of columns

656
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,925
a并把它们放进去看看它们是不是
of a and put them in to see if they were

657
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:37,365
独立，假设我采取了一排
independent and suppose I took rows of a

658
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,645
现在我要采取字面意思
now I'm going to take literally rows of

659
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,895
a把它们放入或放好，所以我称之为
a and put them into or well so I call it

660
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,475
我们的旋风或者其他东西，因为它将是一个
our twiddle or something cuz it'll be a

661
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,745
不同的R我会用实际不
different R I'm gonna use actually not

662
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,775
我不打算使用那些行但是我
I'm not going to use those rows but I'm

663
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,155
那将要拿两个实际的行
gonna take two actual rows of a then

664
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,365
这是什么，这是重要的分解
what so that's important factorization

665
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:05,295
但这不正确我不会，如果我
but it's not correct I wouldn't if I

666
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,415
拿了另外两行我们不会
took two other rows of our it wouldn't

667
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,055
工作，所以你必须放在中间
work so you have to put in the middle

668
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,465
你创造了一些二乘二矩阵
some two-by-two matrix you that makes it

669
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:20,265
只是你会在里面看到正确的
correct just you'll see on the in the in

670
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,405
第1.1节我很兴奋
that section 1.1 that I got excited and

671
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:28,155
写了一个关于看到你的页面
wrote a page about seeing you are yep

672
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,685
固体只是提到他好了，所以现在我
solid just mention that okay so now I'm

673
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,815
准备哦，我想说些什么
ready oh I wanted to say something about

674
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,835
课程决定了关于质量的事情但是
the course decided thing about mass but

675
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:47,085
有这个课程，所以这是怎么回事
there is this course so what's up so

676
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,985
有线性代数问题，但是
there be linear algebra problems but but

677
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,655
是什么让这个过程特别是
what makes this course special is the

678
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:59,445
其他在线和你的作业
other homeworks which are online and you

679
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:04,515
会使用让我们原则上看你
would use let's see in principle you

680
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,295
可以使用任何语言
could use any of the languages

681
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,854
MATLAB的Python这已成为
MATLAB Python which has become the

682
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:15,645
最常用于深度学习或
biggest most used for deep learning or

683
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,895
朱莉娅这是热门
Julia which is the hot

684
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:26,765
最后一个学期的新语言
new language and so last semester the

685
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:31,445
问题哦，所以去年发生的事情
problems oh so what happened last year

686
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,015
这个课程中的一切都是颂歌
well everything in this course is ode to

687
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,065
一位来自大学的教授
a professor who visited from University

688
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,965
密歇根大学教授rah-rahsRao
of Michigan professor rah-rahs Rao

689
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,005
谁教给了大部分的演讲的
who taught gave most of the lectures a

690
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,195
一年前带来了这些功课问题
year ago brought these homework problems

691
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,695
在线作业问题让人们如此
online homework problems so that people

692
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,765
带上笔记本电脑上课，我们做到了
brought laptops to class and we did

693
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:00,225
课堂上的东西，所以他曾经和
things in class and so he had had and

694
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,875
在EE中有非常成功的EE课程
has very successful course in EE in

695
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,135
密歇根州，但他从这里获得博士学位
Michigan and but he was a PhD from here

696
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,175
他回来后在休假，他
and he came back on a sabbatical and he

697
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,355
创造了这让我们开始和我们
created this got us started and we

698
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,455
真的欠他很多
really owe a lot to him

699
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,335
阿德尔曼教授也参与其中
also professor Adelman was involved with

700
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,945
这个课程，你可能会知道他
this course and you may be know that he

701
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,435
创造了朱莉娅有多少人喜欢知道什么
created julia how many like know what

702
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,045
朱莉娅很棒哦
julia is Oh wonderful

703
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:35,265
这将使他的一天，他告诉我每一个
that will make his day he tells me every

704
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,725
时间我看到朱莉娅很好，我告诉他
time I see him Julia's good and I tell

705
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,735
不管怎么说，我相信它还可以
him I believe it ok anyway and it's

706
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,395
成为1806年的教授约翰逊
become the professor Johnson in 1806 has

707
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,625
使用朱莉娅和每学期的斯蒂芬
used Julia and every semester Stephen

708
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,485
约翰逊在第一周给出了一个
Johnson gives in the first week a

709
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:59,715
关于朱莉娅的教程，所以他就是这样
tutorial on Julia and so he's that's

710
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,935
安排我答应告诉你
arranged and I promised to tell you

711
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,735
哪里哪里的时候是这样的，我认为，如果
where where when that is so I think if

712
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,445
你不知道任何关于朱莉娅尝试
you don't know anything about Julia try

713
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:13,875
去星期五的Stata吧
to go it's in Stata it's on Friday at

714
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,345
5:005:00到7:00所以Julia来自
5:00 5:00 to 7:00 so Julia from

715
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,455
约翰逊教授
professor Johnson

716
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,315
所以他多次这样做了
so he's done this multiple times he's

717
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,265
擅长
good at it

718
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:36,195
所以这是McQueen的哦，但我我猜
so that's McQueen Oh yet what I I guess

719
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,055
我希望你有一个选项，
I'm hoping that you'll have an option to

720
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,285
使用三种语言中的任何一种，但是
use all any of the three languages but

721
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,405
我们提供的在线产品
the the the online thing that we give

722
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:48,375
你是朱莉娅创建的教授
you was created in Julia so professor

723
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,375
去年春天，饶必须学习朱莉娅
Rao had to learn Julia last spring and

724
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,475
虽然他们的班级也做了，而且有
though their class did too and there was

725
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,185
关于它的一定程度的婊子
a certain amount of bitching about it

726
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,875
但我想也许只有一个例外
but I think with maybe one exception who

727
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,715
仍然有一个A我们每个人都有点
still got an A we everybody was kind of

728
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,985
好吧，是兰欣茱莉亚
okay and was glad to learn Julia and

729
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,175
饶教授现在完全使用朱莉娅
professor Rao now uses Julia entirely

730
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,795
像这样，他是创造上匝道一个新的与
like so he's creating a new on-ramp with

731
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,455
朱莉娅
Julia

732
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,825
顺便说一下，MATLAB刚发布了一个
MATLAB by the way has just issued an

733
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,885
我会告诉他们深入学习的过程
on-ramp to deep learning that I'll tell

734
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,665
你可能会得到一个MATLAB
you about and probably get a MATLAB

735
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,695
有数学人的工作要说
somebody from math works to to say

736
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,425
关于它的事情是的，所以这是什么
something about it yeah so that's what's

737
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,615
即便如此，我们还不太清楚
coming that we don't quite know exactly

738
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,285
我们将如何组织这些家庭作业
how we'll organize those homeworks would

739
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,195
只需要拿第一个，看看有什么
just take the first one and see see what

740
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,825
发生
happens

741
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,165
所以我肯定会说更多
so I'll certainly say more about

742
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,305
作业的时候甚至可能
homeworks when when the maybe even

743
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,795
周五但还有其他问题
Friday but are there other questions

744
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,735
我应该这么回答，因为有些人
that I should answer so because some

745
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,265
人们会好好想的我会去
people will be thinking okay am I going

746
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,815
要做到这一点，还是我要坐六点哦
to do this or am I gonna sit in six oh

747
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,505
三个六或其他一些深入的课程

可以给我发电子邮件，以便我们有一个恒星
can email me so we will have a stellar

750
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:13,365
网站，你会看到所有的TAS
site and you'll see all the the TAS are

751
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,645
仍然被命名但是精彩
still to be named but the wonderful

752
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,165
拿东西的是本科生
thing is that undergraduates who took

753
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,795
这门课程去年是志愿者
this course last year are volunteering

754
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,255
为你们做分级，所以他们会
to be graders for you guys so they will

755
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,655
知道那些在线作业是什么
know what those online homeworks were

756
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,265
关于它没问题，这就是它的意思
about it okay so that's what's it's a

757
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:37,935
排序第一个字将会发生什么
sort of first word about what's coming

758
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,145
关于语言还可以
about about the language okay

759
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,975
我要完成一个非常重要的事情
I'm gonna finish by a very important

760
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,935
主题乘以一次B哦看
topic multiplying a times B oh look

761
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,564
清洁板，所以我知道我想要倍增
cleaning board so I know I want multiply

762
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:56,045
将矩阵乘以向量
multiply a matrix by a vector

763
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,765
好的，大家都知道怎么做你
okay everybody knows how to do it you

764
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:06,675
排成一排让你排成一排
take a row of a so you take a row of a

765
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,445
你拿了一列B然后你就拿走了
and you take a column of B and you take

766
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:16,114
这个点产品让你得到点积
that dot product so you get dot product

767
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:24,795
行行得到列行点再次
row row got column row dot that's again

768
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,275
低级别对初学者来说还可以，但是我们
low level like okay for beginners but we

769
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,755
想要看到矩阵乘法a
want to see that matrix multiplication a

770
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,614
B更深入，更深层次
B in a deeper way and the deeper way is

771
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:45,314
列乘以行的行列
columns times rows columns of a rows of

772
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:48,584
B列时间排得很好我们有一个
B columns times rows well we had a

773
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:53,114
列是右边一行就是这个
column times a row right that was this

774
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,125
排名我们有列时间的例子
rank one example we had our column times

775
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,165
一行，它产生了一个矩阵和
a row and it produced a matrix and

776
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,564
这就是它的样子，它的排名
that's what it looks like and it's rank

777
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:08,495
是一个所以那些是什么
was one so those are what

778
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,614
我们有一个好的所以它是一个组合
we have a good so it's a combination of

779
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:17,525
它非常像斧头我真的很公正
it's very like ax I'm really just

780
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:22,895
将斧头的想法扩展到B所以这样
extending the ax idea to a B so so this

781
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,675
这是旧的方式，一种新的方式是列
this is the old way a new way is columns

782
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,315
所以有K列它会成倍增加
so there's column K it will multiply

783
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,425
果然它会倍增r好吧
sure enough it multiplies r okay

784
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,945
每个人都认为会发生这种情况
everybody sees that it will happen that

785
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,344
如果你这样做的方式，你做的方式
way if you do it the old way when you do

786
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:43,445
这里的东西的点积
a dot product of something here

787
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,425
你正在做这些事
something here you're doing these

788
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,495
乘法和当你击中列时
multiplications and when you hit column

789
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,705
K在这里你打了K行所以这些
K here you hit row K there so so these

790
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:58,285
是连接所以我得到的东西
are connected so so I get things like

791
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:08,465
B和I的时间R好的列K.
column K of a times R okay of B and I

792
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,235
我不知道你的记号
don't know what notation to you so I

793
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,584
只是写了他们写的话好吧
just wrote them wrote the words okay

794
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:18,695
但现在这一块的的
but now that's one piece of the of the

795
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,334
最终答案的乐趣B是一个
fun of the final answer a B that's a

796
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:23,614
排名像建筑物一样的一块
rank one piece that's a like a building

797
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:29,945
阻止所以我从k等于1汤姆1
block so I add from k equal 1 tom 1

798
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,665
时间排一列一列Row
times Row one column one of a times Row

799
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:38,225
其中一个B加da加列K加和
one of B plus da plus column K plus and

800
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,055
当然，我有时会停止它
of course I stop it column in of a times

801
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:52,555
因此它是外部产品的总和
row in so it's a sum of outer products

802
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,825
因此，每个人都会看到一笔款项
some of so everybody sees a sum because

803
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:03,215
II列1列第1列K列
I I have column 1 times Row 1 column K

804
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,705
时间Rok称他们n次排入和
times R ok call them n times row in and

805
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:12,084
然后我添加那些它只是
then I add those pieces it's just the

806
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:17,165
那里有X2矩阵B的推广
generalization of a X 2 matrix B there

807
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,185
所以这是它的总和
so it's the sum of

808
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:30,245
B的Roque的m'kay流氓，也许我们
m'kay rogue of a Roque of B and maybe we

809
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,675
我们应该检查那给了我们的
should we check that that gives us the

810
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,915
正确的回答也许我不会那么做
right answer or maybe I won't do that

811
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,375
在这里，但它就是我们所做的一切
here but it it's it's all we're doing is

812
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,725
相同的乘法在不同的
the same multiplications in a different

813
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,175
订单实际上让我们退出一个
order actually let's just quit with one

814
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,525
我们可以弄清楚有多少
minute we can figure out how many

815
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,535
乘法有多少
multiplications are there how many

816
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,525
乘以做一个M乘n矩阵a
multiplications to do a M by n matrix a

817
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:59,045
时间是P矩阵B的结束，所以是a
time's the end by P matrix B so that's a

818
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,045
次数B个别数字
times B how many individual numbers

819
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,505
因为这是决定它的成本
because this is determine the cost of it

820
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:10,555
我们需要多少个数字
how many numbers would we need well

821
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,995
假设我们在内心深处做旧的方式
suppose we do it the old way by in inner

822
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,375
产品行x列那么多少怎么样
product row x column so how many how

823
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,985
很多次乘法我做了一次
many multiplications to do a row times I

824
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:25,235
给他们打电话，得到的一个条目
call them and get one entry in the

825
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:30,425
回答n右边的行有长度
answer n right the row has length in the

826
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:32,735
列的长度为n次乘法
column has length in n multiplications

827
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,005
这是N，现在有多少人这样做了
so that's N and now how many of those do

828
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:42,245
我必须做MP，因为它的大小
I have to do MP because what's the size

829
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,305
这个答案大小的答案
of this answer the size of this answer

830
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:51,125
是的，所以如果我这样做，他们就可以了
is n by P okay so if I do they do it in

831
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:54,755
那个旧命令就像n乘法一样
that old order like n multiplications to

832
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,364
做一个点产品，我有这么多
do a dot product and I've got this many

833
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:00,005
在答案中点了产品，所以我得到了M.
dot products in the answer so I've got M

834
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:08,285
和P多次乘法现在假设我
and P multiple multiplies now suppose I

835
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,975
这样做
do it this way

836
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,864
做多少次乘法
how many multiplications to do one of

837
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:18,505
那些家伙将一列乘以一列
those guys to multiply a column by a row

838
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:24,005
将此列乘以一行
to multiply a column by a row this this

839
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:29,675
是一个M，这是1乘P1
is an M by one and this is a 1 by P one

840
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,785
第一列
column one row

841
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,815
多少次乘法那家伙在
how many multiplications for that guy in

842
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,625
P和那些排名的人中有多少人
P and how many of those ranked ones do I

843
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:45,945
你必须得到它的MP时间
have to do you got it it's MP times in

844
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:53,345
现在是另一种方式是n次
now it's the other way was was n times

845
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:59,085
MP所以给出相同的答案MNp
MP so it gives the same answer MN p

846
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,545
事实上，他们完全一样
mostly in fact they're exactly the same

847
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,615
乘法只是一个不同的顺序
multiplications just a different order

848
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,425
好的，我们在155感谢您的光临
