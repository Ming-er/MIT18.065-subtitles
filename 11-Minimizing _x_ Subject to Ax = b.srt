好吧，有三件事要提一个
well so three things to mention one was

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,895
你还记得我上次列出的一份清单
you remember last time I made a list of

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,835
六七种不同的情况
six or seven different situations where

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,554
他们X等于B和可能的问题
they X equal B and problems that could

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,125
出现上一次是当只是
arise the last one was when a was just

14
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,605
方式太大，不适合核心，但在
way too big to fit into core but in the

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,105
中间是那么其他的其他方法
middle were other methods so other

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,575
像列一样的问题
issues like columns being nearly

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,075
当克斯施密特出现时依赖
dependent when gram-schmidt will come up

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,355
首先，我想说我知道那里
first I want to say that I know there

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,965
在这两个页面II思想错别字
are typos in the two pages I I thought

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,695
你可能只想看到它
you might just like to see the very

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,175
书的两页初稿所以
first draft of two pages of the book so

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,825
人们有时会问我多长时间？
people sometimes ask me how long does

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,545
这本书采取写，所以我开始时
the book take to write so I started when

24
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,245
1806年五年开始，所以我进入
1806 five started a year ago so I'm into

25
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,435
第二年通常需要两年
the second year and it usually takes two

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,985
年，系统是我手工编写的
years and the system is I write by hand

27
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,625
所以我写了那些你打开的页面
so I wrote those opening pages that you

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,034
手工看了两页然后我扫描了它们
saw two pages by hand then I scan them

29
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,215
到孟买我最好的朋友
to Mumbai where my best friend in the

30
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,924
世界
world

31
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:46,894
用拼写错误输入他们没问题因为
types them with typos no problem because

32
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,715
我要让这么多的变化，一个
I'm gonna make so many changes that a

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,704
几个错别字是反正没事，所以他扫描
few typos are nothing anyway so he scans

34
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:58,445
他们回到我打字然后我开始
them back to me typed and then I start

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,504
如果我很幸运并有了改变，那就做出改变
making changes if I'm lucky and have the

36
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:03,695
我在这里谈论它的机会
chance to talk about it in here then I

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,605
实现更好的事情，我扫描
realize better things to do and I scan

38
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,915
回到他身边然后回到我身边
back to him and back to me and back to

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,855
他回到我身边那就是那个地方
him and back to me so that's where that

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,204
无论如何我两年都消失了
two years disappear anyway I'm quite

41
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,195
在我开始之前对这两页感到高兴
happy with those two pages until I start

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,895
改善它们还有另一个话题
improving them okay and one other topic

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,165
从过去我认为是那样的
from the past that I thought was that

44
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,805
在课堂上出来的不在笔记中
came out in class wasn't in the notes

45
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,995
但你还记得那一天吗？
yet do you remember the day that we

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,355
最小化
minimized

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,745
不同的规范
different norm

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:44,705
l1或l2或maxL无穷大范数
l1 or l2 or max L infinity norm for with

49
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,895
解决问题的条件
the condition of solving with a

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,195
约束这个方程
constraint that this equation was

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,895
我很满意我在2d能够画出一个
satisfied I'm in 2d to be able to draw a

52
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,165
图片和约束是一行
picture and the constraint is one line

53
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,265
这就是线条看起来的样子
and that's about what the line looks

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,905
像这样我会再次提请这里这么
like so I'm gonna draw here again so

55
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,235
我正在做的是放一些数字
what I'm doing is putting some numbers

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:14,495
在以这种洞察力，我画了一个左右
in to that insight that I drew about a

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,375
一周前你还记得那个，因为我
week ago do you remember that because I

58
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,245
以为这真的说明了为什么如何
thought that really illustrates why how

59
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,185
L1和L2以及L无穷大是不同的
L 1 and L 2 and L infinity are different

60
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,755
让我让我在这里画出L21
let's let me draw the L 2 1 here so

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,115
哪来的这条线，因此X点
where's the point on this line so the X

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,865
必须躺在这条线上，在哪里
has to lie on this line and where is the

63
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,135
具有最小总和的点
point that has the smallest sum of

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,175
正方形标准L2范数如此
squares norm standard L 2 norm so

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,465
几何上哪个点好
geometrically where is that point well

66
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,245
什么是具有规范的点集
what does the set of points with norm

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,165
一个看起来像L2它是一个圆圈
one look like for L 2 it's a circle

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,525
是的，所以我们只是把那个圈子吹了起来
right so we just blow that circle up or

69
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,525
缩小它直到触及它
shrink it down until it touches this

70
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,925
事情，现在它会触及它的位置
thing and now it'll touch where it

71
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,264
接触它会触及我们的半径
touches it'll touch where our radius is

72
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,195
垂直所以有圆圈
perpendicular so there's the circle

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,795
L2中有我们最好的一点，因为如果
there's our best point in L 2 because if

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,615
因为如果我们选择另一个点，我们就会
because if we picked another point we'd

75
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,405
有吹的规范，即规范会
have to blow the norm that norm would

76
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,025
必须更大才能完成
have to be bigger to go through that

77
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,395
这点显然是第一个
point so that's clearly the first one

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,975
实际上我们可以看到
and and actually we can probably see

79
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,435
它是什么，因为如果我们知道的话
what it is because those if we know

80
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,765
那些是垂直的，我知道斜率
those are perpendicular I know the slope

81
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,375
这条线所以我认为是斜坡
of this line so I think that the slope

82
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,115
这条线就像是3/4
of this line is something like 3/4

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,195
可能来自那里或者可能是4/3
probably coming from there or maybe 4/3

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,325
我能算出来，我认为是的
I can we'll figure it out I think it's

85
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,625
三分之三是的，我想我会找到的
four thirds yeah I think that I'll find

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,265
那一点是最有趣的一点
that point then the most interesting one

87
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,475
是l1规范，因为是什么
was the l1 norm because what was the

88
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,175
单位球的形状为l1a钻石
shape of the unit ball for l1 a diamond

89
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,695
对钻石那么钻石那么
right a diamond so the diamond that

90
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:13,055
第一接触线在这里，真实
first touches the line is here that's

91
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,865
获胜点，如果线是3X.
the winning point and if the line is 3 X

92
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,655
1加4X2等于1然后我知道
1 plus 4 X 2 equal 1 then I know that

93
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,235
那一点是XX1将是0和X2
that point is X X 1 will be 0 and X 2

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,685
将是1/4，这是胜利点
will be 1/4 so that's the winning point

95
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:36,125
在l1，我想我计算了这个
in l1 and I think I calculated this

96
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,405
这是l2的胜利点
right that's a winning point in l2

97
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,935
我想会让我们看到这种情况发生了变化
I think will be let's see this goes up

98
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,195
对我来说，我想是这么想的
to I I'm so moving down the line I think

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,915
这将有三个二十五分之一
this would have three twenty fifths for

100
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,115
二十五分之二，我不会停下来
twenty fifths I won't stop to derive

101
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,995
这一点，但至少现在这是的，这
that but at least now this yeah that

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,805
斜坡看起来像4/3上升为
slope is looking like 4/3 goes up for

103
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,105
当它穿过三个那四个和
when it crosses three and that four and

104
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,535
三个人当然是从那里来的
the three came from there and of course

105
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,355
你注意到我选择了我已经缩放了
you notice I've chosen that I've scaled

106
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,025
它适合行3米乘3
it to fit the line three times three

107
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,385
2015年3月9日第25届五分之一
fifths in 3 2015 9 25th

108
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,605
加上162525th是1，最后是什么
Plus 16 25th 25th is 1 and finally what

109
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,945
关于L无限是什么画面
about L infinity what was the picture

110
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,945
那里的单位球是什么样的
there what's the unit ball look like in

111
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:33,365
最大标准为2d，右边是正方形
2d for the max norm it's a square right

112
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,445
因此广场将击中这两个
so the square will hit there these two

113
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,065
在广场上，这是一个45度
on the square are this is a 45-degree

114
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,935
现在在那个广场上划线它
line now on that square it hits it at

115
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,055
那个尖点等x1和
that sharp point and so the x1 and the

116
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,215
x2是平等的，我认为它们是
x2 are equal and I think they're

117
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,065
大概
probably

118
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,045
如果我们的话，让我们看看他们是否平等
let's see if they're equal if me if we

119
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,465
使它们成为1/7
made them 1/7 that would be

120
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,295
然后我有三个七分加四分
then I have three sevenths plus four

121
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,325
sevens等于7/7是的我想我们做的
sevens equals 7/7 yeah I think we make

122
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,365
那么一点七七七
some one seventh one seventh then so

123
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,535
这将是X无穷远点3/7
that would be the X infinity point 3/7

124
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,395
再加上4/7给出一个，为什么我要提到
plus 4/7 gives one so why do I mention

125
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,495
这首先是因为我之前做过的
this first because when I did it before

126
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,815
我没有真的扔过照片
I just threw pictures without really

127
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,675
解决问题，其次是因为
solving the problem and secondly because

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,455
在思考这个项目的未来
in thinking of ahead about projects this

129
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,085
是我想要的那种项目
is the kind of project that I would

130
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,275
觉得挺有意思的明显
think is quite interesting obviously as

131
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,965
这是P等于1这是P等于
this is P equal 1 this is P equal to

132
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,685
这是P等于无穷大，我猜
this is P equal infinity and I guess

133
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,635
从图片中可以清楚地看到
it's pretty clear from the pictures that

134
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,985
随着P的增加，这一点开始于此
as P increases this point starts up here

135
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,495
和向下移动一行，并在这里结束了
and moves down the line and ends up here

136
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,155
而且我不知道该怎样移动
and I have no idea like what to move

137
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,525
什么解决方案是一个不同的P
what the solution is for a different P

138
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,525
以及如何移动并使其成功
and how it moves and to make it make it

139
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,055
更多关于项目在3d中发生的事情
more about project what happens in 3d

140
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,635
如果我有一个在3d中3d中会发生什么
what happens in 3d in 3d if I have one

141
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,385
在3d中的方程然后我有一个平面和
equation in 3d then I have a plane and

142
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,914
这些将成为3D钻石
these this would become a diamond a 3d

143
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,675
钻石这将是一个3d球体
diamond this would be a 3d sphere this

144
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,875
将是一个他们将扩展到的3d立方体
would be a 3d cube they would expand to

145
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,355
打那架飞机，我不知道有多少
hit that plane and I don't know how many

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,224
在这种情况下，你会得到零
zeroes you get in that case so that

147
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,435
将是一个等式的情况
would be the case of one one equation so

148
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,034
这架钻石有一架飞机
there'd be a plane that these diamond

149
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,865
Q的球体和Q扩展直到它们击中
Q's sphere and Q expand until they hit

150
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,165
它或你可以有两个约束二
it or you could have two constraints two

151
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,135
方程所以，如果我们有两个方程和
equations so if we had two equations and

152
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,205
三个未知数将成为一条线
three unknowns that would be a line

153
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,715
再次，但我们会得到多少零
again but would we get how many zeroes

154
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,515
我们会遇到这些不同的情况吗？
would we get in these different cases

155
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,165
我是多么稀疏l1会好起来的
how sparse is l1 gonna be okay can I

156
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,075
只是像的夺回我们
just that's like a recapture of what we

157
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,065
我觉得这很好吗？
did I thought it was a it's nice

158
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,095
偶尔
occasionally

159
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,115
有图片展示什么什么
have pictures showing what what a

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,775
解决方案现在是我的解决方案
solution where the solution is now I'm

161
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,055
来到当天的主题
coming to the to the topic of the day

162
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,085
这是克施密特等等
which is gram-schmidt and so

163
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,985
克-施密特第一是标准
gram-schmidt number one is the standard

164
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,825
将在1806年教授的方式和
way that would be taught in 1806 and the

165
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,445
结果是什么克斯施密特
result is so what's gram-schmidt about

166
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,415
我会在这里放下一般性的
and I'll just put down here general

167
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,235
克-施密特的事实我们从一开始
facts of gram-schmidt we start with a

168
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:59,085
矩阵a它有n列，但它们是
matrix a it's got n columns but they're

169
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,055
不正交，事实上它们可能是
not orthogonal and in fact they may be

170
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,655
条件严格的列可能是
badly conditioned columns might be

171
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,625
几乎依赖于别人我要
nearly dependent on the others I'm gonna

172
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,115
假设列是独立的但是
assume the columns are independent but

173
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,855
他们可能几乎没有独立
they might be barely independent so

174
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,615
克施密特所以他们就是那些线
gram-schmidt so they're those lines then

175
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,655
会有点像指点
would be sort of like pointing very

176
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,655
几乎平行，但克施密特打开了
nearly parallel but gram-schmidt opens

177
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,425
上图得到一个矩阵qan
up the picture to get a matrix q an

178
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,785
具有列Q1至Q的正交矩阵
orthogonal matrix with columns Q 1 to Q

179
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,725
n是正交的，所以它得到了一个
n which are orthonormal so it gets a

180
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,095
Q的完美基础，这就是什么
perfect basis of Q's and so that's what

181
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,375
克施密特做的就是这些
gram-schmidt does and these are

182
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,505
以不同的方式做不同的方式
different ways to do it different ways

183
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,365
我真的要组织计算
to organize the computation I really

184
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,515
只把标准的方式放在什么地方
only put the standard way in what is

185
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,815
这个神秘的RI声称，所以他们
this mysterious R I claim that so they

186
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,415
来这些Q的是
come these these the Q's are

187
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,085
A的组合所以有一些
combinations of the A's so there's some

188
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,975
矩阵告诉我那些是什么
matrix to tell me what those

189
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,335
组合是或如果我回去
combinations are or if I go back go

190
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,085
倒退，并说A好
backwards and say well the A's are

191
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,095
Q的组合就是我的意思
combinations of the Q's that's what I'm

192
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,275
关于做，如果我说的每一个是一个
about to do if I say each a is a

193
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,265
Q的组合意味着我的一个
combination of Q's that means that my a

194
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,775
可以
may

195
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,555
Trix是我的Q矩阵时间，有些是矩阵
Trix is my Q matrix time some are matrix

196
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,205
这告诉我组合正确
which tells me the combinations right

197
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,275
当我乘以右边的R时，我就是
when I multiply by R on the right I'm

198
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,365
采用Q列的组合
taking combinations of the columns of Q

199
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,305
并得到一个如此公正的列
and getting the columns of a so just

200
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,755
像Lu一样，你可以继续前进
like Lu it's kind of you go forward with

201
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,775
我们去的算法到达你这里
the algorithm to reach you here we go

202
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,115
用算法转发到达Q.
forward with the algorithm to reach Q

203
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,415
但是当我们想了解put时
but then when we want to understand put

204
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,015
它把它在一个简单的公式就
it put it in one simple equation it

205
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,965
事实证明最好去
turns out to be like better to go

206
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,525
向后说，原来是怎么回事
backwards and say how is the original a

207
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,655
与最终的Q有关，必须有
related to the final Q and there has to

208
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,515
当我说话的时候我总觉得有些好
be some R ok I always feel when I talk

209
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,855
关于克施密特，我通常以
about gram-schmidt I usually end with

210
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,035
相当于QR，当然还有MATLAB
that equal Q R and of course the MATLAB

211
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,185
在MATLAB中命令正好是QR
command is exactly Q R so in MATLAB

212
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,725
你问的命令是Q
you're asking for the command would be Q

213
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,245
R的一个而不是一个如此的Lu
R of a instead of Lu of a so it would

214
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,065
给你一个Q和R这就是MATLAB
give you a Q and R that's what MATLAB

215
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,255
现在将输出，因为我说Q是事情
will output now as I say Q is the thing

216
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,175
我们正在构建R是组合
we're constructing R is the combinations

217
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:50,625
我们需要得到我们想要的东西
that we need to get what we want and so

218
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,305
这是一个有点它是在结束
it's a little it comes at the end

219
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,765
什么是R，但实际上R是
what the heck was R but actually R is

220
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,005
真是一个简单的想法，所以我想展示
really a simple idea so I want to show

221
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,825
在开始而不是结束
that at the beginning instead of the end

222
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,265
好的，所以我打算把Q移到这里
okay so I'm going to move Q over here as

223
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:11,775
Q反向但Q反Q是什么
Q inverse but what is Q inverse Q

224
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,055
转换正确因为我创造了一个
transpose right because I've created an

225
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,845
正交矩阵所以这个神秘的R
orthogonal matrix so this mysterious R

226
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,845
是Q转置一个让我放
is Q transpose a and let me just put

227
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,645
让我有点让它成长
here the let me sort of make it grow out

228
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,395
进入具有Q的矩阵
into matrices that has the Q's along the

229
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,405
行Q转换当然是QN转置
rows Q transpose of course QN transpose

230
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,434
Q1我只是转置
Q 1 transpose I just

231
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:41,924
我正在将矩阵转置到它上面
I'm transposing the matrix above it so

232
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,744
这些列成为A的行数
these columns become rows times the A's

233
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:54,764
a1到nn什么是典型的条目
a 1 to a n so what is a typical entry in

234
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,454
我们这就是我想说的原因
our that's really why I want to say

235
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,004
你能做到这一点并不神秘
nothing mysterious about this you can

236
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,494
看看你最终的结果是对的
see what you end up with it'll be right

237
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,424
在我们面前这是什么典型的
in front of us here what is a typical

238
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:12,314
第I行J列中的条目是什么
what is the entry in row I column J of

239
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:18,724
我们确定这就是所有这些
our ok this this says that all those

240
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:26,014
我们的Qi中的条目转置时间AJ
entries in our our Qi transpose times AJ

241
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:28,904
对，这是繁殖的旧方式
right that's the old way to multiply

242
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,454
矩阵和它是最好的方法
matrices and on it's the best way for

243
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:36,494
换句话说，这一行乘以一列
this a row times a column in other words

244
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:41,054
我们的只是内在的产品
the ours are just the inner product the

245
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,174
Q的第8个积分
dot product of the Q's with the 8th of

246
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:47,654
Q与A的那就是那种
the Q's with the A's that's that's sort

247
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,744
对我们来说并不神秘
of like nothing mysterious about our

248
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:53,434
因为Q是我们的正交矩阵
because Q is an orthogonal matrix we

249
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,345
能够把它放在这里
were able to put it over here

250
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,274
得到一个很好的表达R，看看是什么
get a nice expression for R and see what

251
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,364
这真的是你能做到的好
it really is so are you good you can do

252
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:10,154
在最后或在路线上，但它是
are at the end or on the route but it's

253
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,014
只是Q的内在产品
just the inner product of the Q's with

254
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,034
A现在好了，克我施密特可以
the A's ok now what's gram-schmidt can I

255
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,364
我有点想你已经看过了
I'm sort of thinking you've seen the

256
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:22,034
克-施密特的基本思想，但让我们来
basic ideas of gram-schmidt but let's

257
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:32,324
回顾所以我从一开始就是这样开始的
review so I start with I start with a so

258
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:37,064
什么是克施密特从1开始
what does gram-schmidt begin with a 1 it

259
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,734
取第一列所以这些是z'
takes that first column so so these a z'

260
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:47,474
一般不是正交但是
are not orthogonal generally but the

261
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,635
第一个方向没问题
first direction is okay

262
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,675
我对第一个没有任何抱怨
I have no complaints about the first

263
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,405
方向，除了一个可能不是
direction except that a one might not be

264
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:01,455
一个单位向量，所以q1只是一个
a unit vector so q1 will just be a one

265
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,015
在其范数有一个单位矢量的
over its norm to have a unit vector the

266
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,095
克-施密特的整个想法是在q2中
whole idea of gram-schmidt is in q2 so

267
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,965
什么是q2整个想法来到这里
what is q2 the whole idea is coming here

268
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,125
是的，这是你唯一需要的东西
yeah it's the only thing you need to

269
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,545
知道，图片显示它如此q2我
know and the picture shows it so q2 I

270
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:26,145
从a开始-但它不是正交的
start with a - but it's not orthogonal

271
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,365
到a-1
to a-1

272
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:33,165
所以我该怎么做才能弄清楚
so what do I do I figure out the

273
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,095
在一个a2的一个队列的部件
component of a queue of a2 in the a one

274
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,855
方向和我删除它，所以我采取这一
direction and I remove it so I take that

275
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,565
矢量路程，我留下了这
vector away and I'm left with this

276
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,845
矢量所以有一个我会打电话的矢量
vector so there is a vector I'll call

277
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:51,425
a2所以a2是原来的小a2
that a 2 so a2 is the original little a2

278
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:58,935
与一个单向除去，从而A2
with the a One Direction removed so a2

279
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,605
像这样什么有什么公式
is like so what what's the formula for

280
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,055
我刚刚做的就是关键的洞
what I just did this is the hole the key

281
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,385
那克克施密特重复的步骤
step that that gram-schmidt repeats over

282
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,055
一遍又一遍，这是真的
and over and over again it's truly

283
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,685
无聊
boring

284
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,204
好了，所以它减去记得非常清楚
okay so it subtracts well remember that

285
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,175
这与q1和q1的方向相同
this is the same direction as q1 and

286
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,465
最好使用q1，因为
it's better to work with q1 because

287
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,365
我们发现那个人我们已经得到了它和我们
we've found that guy we've got it and we

288
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,515
知道我们知道这是一个单位向量
know we know it's a unit vector so

289
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,445
这是我的线性代数问题是什么
here's my linear algebra question what's

290
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,835
我想要的2的组成部分
the component of a 2 that I want to

291
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,015
减去其中的组件
subtract off its the component in the

292
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,515
Q1的方向就是这个
direction of Q 1 it's this in the

293
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,825
Q1的方向让我公正
direction of Q 1 and let me just

294
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,565
记得
remember

295
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,965
很明显，这个角度正在形成
so obviously that angle is coming into

296
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:59,675
所以这将是一个2转置Q1
it so that'll be an a 2 transpose Q 1

297
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,585
时间Q1就是这样
times Q 1 that's it

298
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:11,415
这是我们删除的组件
that's the component that we removed

299
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,495
也许我也许我更愿意把它写成
maybe I maybe I'd prefer to write it as

300
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,305
q1转置a-我不知道
q1 transpose a - I don't know

301
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,625
管点当然没关系
doesn't matter of course the tube dot

302
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,785
产品在那里说也许我会
products are there saying maybe I will

303
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:35,275
只是，是的，现在好了，是什么
just yeah yeah well okay now what is

304
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,165
应该做什么做到这一点
supposed to what does what does that

305
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,435
矢量应该实现它的假设
vector supposed to achieve it's supposed

306
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,575
作为这个向量这是这个向量
to be this vector this is this vector

307
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,815
我真打算叫两个因为
I'm really going to call a two because

308
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,895
它正朝着q2的正确方向发展
it's on in the right direction for q2

309
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,615
但它还不正常，那么q2是什么
but it is not yet normal so what is q2

310
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,005
那么我就说这个家伙得到了
then so I'm saying this guy got the

311
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,365
方向对这个东西减去了
direction right this thing subtracted

312
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,195
这个向量得到了正确的方向
off this vector got that direction right

313
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,815
它得到了它-现在是什么q2我
it got it as a - what is q2 now that I

314
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,795
想要完成我有方向
want to finish I've got the direction

315
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,545
我想做的就是让它成为一个单位
all I want to do is get it to be a unit

316
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,355
矢量，所以我只需要2
vector so I just take a 2 over its

317
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,815
正常，双步是整体
normal that double step is the whole

318
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,285
整个事情在克施密特的事情
thing in gram-schmidt the whole thing

319
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,325
减去关中的组件
subtract off the components in the

320
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,705
方向已经设定，你得到
directions already set and you get

321
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,415
一些全新的方向
something in a totally new direction

322
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,305
称为资本A然后你分裂
called a capital A and then you divide

323
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,435
通过它的长度使它成为一个单位向量
by its length to make it a unit vector

324
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,875
这给你新的Q所以你看
and that gives you the new Q so you see

325
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,545
只是为了表明我们已经明白了
just to show that we've got the point

326
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,975
那么针对q3的下一步呢？
what about the next step aiming for q3

327
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,635
所以告诉我3我应该是3
so tell me what a 3 should be a 3 I'm

328
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,035
从这开始，我要去
gonna start with this and I'm going to

329
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,415
减去一些东西我要去的东西
subtract off some stuff what am I going

330
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,845
减去
to subtract off

331
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,585
是组件III转置右x
is the component III transpose right x

332
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,375
q1q1我还没检查那个
q1 q1 and I didn't yet check that that

333
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,855
这使得这与正交
makes that this came out orthogonal to

334
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,915
Q1我会回来的，现在我有我
q1 I'll come back to that now I have I

335
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,965
我做了我应该做的一切吗？
have I done everything I should do here

336
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,335
有三个没有，我还有一步
with a three no I've got one more step

337
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,765
采取，我应该采取这两个步骤
to take and I should take the two steps

338
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,725
分别
separately

339
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,505
它被称为修改过的gram-schmidt和
it's called modified gram-schmidt and

340
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,415
我想做的是减去q2
what I want to do is subtract off the q2

341
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,035
组件那么q2的多重做什么
component so what what multiple of q2 do

342
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,065
我需要因为q2已被设置
I need to because q2 has been set by the

343
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:04,554
时间我到了a3所以这里发生了什么
time I get to a3 so what what goes here

344
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:12,965
a3转置Q2谢谢你，如果
a3 transpose Q 2 thanks thanks you if

345
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,554
你看一个代码说一个MATLAB代码
you look at a code say a MATLAB code to

346
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,495
做克施密特哦最后的q3是什么
do gram-schmidt Oh what's the final q3

347
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:28,145
然后将其标准化，以便你拿3个
then normalize it so you take a 3 which

348
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,215
是在正确的方向，你分裂
is in the right direction and you divide

349
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,815
通过它的长度得到一个单位向量是啊
by its length to get a unit vector yeah

350
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,455
让我回来写一下
let me just come back and write and

351
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,585
重新检查我做得对，我得到了
recheck that I did it right that I got

352
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,595
正确的方向所以我的意思是什么
the right direction so what do I mean by

353
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,665
正确的方向我应该拥有什么
the right direction what should I have

354
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,685
我该怎么检查那个人我
what should I check about that guy I

355
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,915
应检查其内积
should check that its inner product with

356
00:21:52,920 --> 00:22:00,125
q1如果这是正确的方向
q1 is it if this is the right direction

357
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,465
走那条路然后我应该检查一下
to go that way then I should check I

358
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,495
我希望能得到它
have to check hopefully I got the

359
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,495
正确的公式，它是点积
formula right that it's dot product

360
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,115
Q1的内积为0
inner product with Q 1 is 0

361
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,575
谢谢你，让我这样吧
thank you so let me just so is it

362
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,615
很明显它是内心的
obvious that it is take the inner

363
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,355
与之相关的点积的产物
product of the dot product of that with

364
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,105
你能得到什么？
q1 what do you get you get

365
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,925
你得到相同的数字Q1a2
you get the same number Q 1 a 2

366
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,445
转置Q1你得到那个数字和
transpose Q 1 you get that number and

367
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,745
在这里你得到一个Q1转置
over here you're getting a Q 1 transpose

368
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:41,065
Q1用Q1换位，所以我看到了
Q 1 transpose with Q 1 so I'm you see

369
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,225
我正在做什么和Bobby看起来像
what I'm doing and Bobby it looks like

370
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,925
我检查那个Q本来会更好
it would have been better I check that Q

371
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:58,045
1转置2是0是啊它是Q1
1 transpose a 2 is 0 yeah it is Q 1

372
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,945
在这里转置2Q1转置2或
transpose a 2 here Q 1 transpose a 2 or

373
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,035
a2转置Q1我不介意和我
a 2 transpose Q 1 I don't mind and I

374
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,965
在这里有另一个Q1转置Q1
have another Q 1 transpose Q 1 here and

375
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,475
那是什么什么是Q1转的Q1
what is that what is Q 1 transpose Q 1

376
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:21,375
它是1所以检查
it is 1 so check

377
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,345
好吧那是克-施密特标准拉姆
okay that's gram-schmidt standard Ram

378
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:33,025
你之前见过的Smit我是
Smit which you have met before now I'm

379
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,465
准备好更好的克施密特你
ready for a better gram-schmidt you

380
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,435
可以说我是更好的克施密特
could say I'm better gram-schmidt

381
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,135
因为这里有啥这将是
because here so what's it going to be

382
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,985
差异在这里，我拿了A的
the difference here I took the A's in

383
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:54,205
他们原来的订单现在假设我做了
their original order now suppose I did

384
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,805
消除消除
that with elimination elimination

385
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,565
通常我们这样写作为行
usually we write as acting on the row so

386
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,905
所以考虑消除我所看到的
so thinking of elimination I'm seeing in

387
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,035
行将是什么危险
the rows what would be the danger in

388
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,825
采取行顺序不做行
taking the rows in order doing no row

389
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,415
交流只是弄清楚每一个角度
exchanges just figure out the pivot each

390
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,925
时间并杀死列的其余部分
time and kill the rest of the column and

391
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,135
然后继续往下走
then move on so taking the rows in the

392
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,405
命令他们来到任何可能的地方
order they came whatever it might be

393
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,845
什么是风险，为什么会这样
what's the risk and what why would

394
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:32,455
MATLAB没有这样做，因为有些东西可以
MATLAB not do that because something can

395
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,355
非常小，完全炸毁你的
be very small and totally blow up your

396
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,565
计算，那是枢轴数
calculation and that's that pivot number

397
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,345
有问题的是你知道a2
sort of the question is you know if a2

398
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:49,734
非常靠近一个，所以让我画一个新的
is very near a one so let me draw a new

399
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,004
图片所以这是a1的风险
picture so here's the risk so a1 was

400
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,315
无论如何2真的很接近
whatever it was if a 2 is really close

401
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,224
相同的方向，然后我
to the same direction then I'm

402
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:03,534
减去几乎所有的和
subtracting off almost all of it and

403
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,534
我有一些小小的东西
I've got some tiny little bit for the

404
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,315
像枢轴一样的新方向
new direction that's like the pivot in

405
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,244
消除它的数量
elimination it's the number that sort of

406
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:19,164
测量什么是新的什么是新的行和
measures what's new what's a new row and

407
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,284
淘汰或新的专栏
elimination or the new column in

408
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:27,774
克施密特给你，如果是的话
gram-schmidt gives you and if that's too

409
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,294
小我的意思是在淘汰我们
small I mean like in elimination we

410
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:34,014
我会说我们永远不会使用
would as I say we would never use an

411
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:36,054
消除一般矩阵的代码
elimination code on a general matrix

412
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,695
没有检查枢轴的大小
that didn't check the size of the pivot

413
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,624
和交换行，必要时也
and exchange rows when necessary well

414
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:46,284
与gram-schmidt类似，它可以采取
similarly with gram-schmidt it can take

415
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:49,254
那些列是为了那个
those columns in order that's the

416
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,504
标准克-施密特参加专栏
standard gram-schmidt taking the columns

417
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:56,065
按顺序，但只有每次检查
in order but only if it checks each time

418
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:02,604
那一点点好一点
that a little bit that a little bit well

419
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:05,784
在新的部分将是什么
that the in the new part what would be

420
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:12,624
新的部分是足够大的能够
the new part is is big enough to be able

421
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:16,134
以我们的东西，如果分
to we have to divide by the thing and if

422
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,315
即A2是微小的是一个很小的载体，这是
that a2 is tiny is a tiny vector this is

423
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,404
除以2和之后是
dividing by a 2 and and onwards is

424
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:27,864
建立在我们不能的舍入错误
building in roundoff error that we can't

425
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:31,284
再次删除它是我们坚持它所以
remove again it's we're stuck with it so

426
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:36,325
这是列交换列
that's the column exchange column

427
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,734
转发想法更多
pivoting idea in a sort of a more

428
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:48,225
专业的克施密特，它需要
professional gram-schmidt and it needs

429
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,405
这样做我必须能够检查
to do it so i have to be able to check

430
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,555
比较这一点，如果它
compare this this little bit if it is

431
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,495
什么我会去做什么
little with what what am I going to

432
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,485
与淘汰相比我看了
compare with in elimination I looked

433
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,135
在列的其余部分为更大的
down the rest of the column for a bigger

434
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,725
在这里，我想知道我猜是什么
number here I want to know I guess what

435
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,465
我要做的是我必须找到这个
I have to do is I have to find this this

436
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:19,505
组件不仅来自a2而且来自所有
component not just from a2 but from all

437
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,425
剩下的A和我会选择
the remaining A's and I'll pick the

438
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,505
最大的就是那句话我
biggest so there in in that sentence I

439
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,675
说列交换的主要思想
said the main idea of column exchanges

440
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,625
一旦你获得Q1一套是
is once you get q1 set which was

441
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,265
肯定q1是最简单的一个
certainly q1 was the easiest one in the

442
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,215
世界，但也许甚至q1哦我猜
world but maybe even for q1 oh I guess

443
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,505
它甚至可能发生
it could even happen

444
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,025
你喜欢那样的开始
you like that would be starting like

445
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,425
从左上角的a0开始
starting with a0 up in the upper left

446
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,005
消失的角落就像是什么样的
corner for elimination like like what a

447
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:57,155
如果a1如果我的话，在这里开始新的一天
way to start the day here if a1 if my

448
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,325
矩阵a有一个小小的a1然后我
matrix a had a tiny little a1 then I

449
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,535
应该寻找更大的一个来获得
should look for a bigger one to get the

450
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,575
第一个Q选择让我们假设给予
very first Q chosen let's suppose give

451
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,785
我们这里有一个合理的机会
ourselves a reasonable chance here let's

452
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:19,055
假设一个是一个体面的大小所以
suppose a one was a decent size so so as

453
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,485
我已经画了，但是2可能不是或者
I've drawn then but a 2 might not or the

454
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,055
下一步可能不是，如果我使用2作为我
next step might not be if I use a 2 as I

455
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,335
说它可能与a1方向相同
say it could be same direction as a1

456
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,725
几乎然后我正在与之合作
virtually and then I'm just working with

457
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,455
那个小小的东西是什么呢
that little piece so what's the what do

458
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,025
我必须做不同的我必须
I have to do differently I have to be

459
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,865
能够比较这个小块
able to compare this little piece with

460
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,665
所有其他的潜在可能性，所以
all the other potential possibilities so

461
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,845
所以，让我写下你的所作所为
so let me just write down what you have

462
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,275
你必须做一个与众不同的事情
to do you have to do in a different

463
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,545
订单所以现在这是列
order so this is now with column

464
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,905
枢轴柱交换柱旋转
pivoting column exchange column pivoting

465
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:06,244
允许或尽可能
allowed or as possible

466
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:13,094
所以我必须找到它
so to make it possible I have to find

467
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:21,044
不仅仅是一件小Q的
not only a to the piece of Q of little a

468
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:25,784
-我必须找到一件我刚才的作品
- I have to find a to the piece I'm just

469
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:28,364
要复制我必须拿第二个
gonna copy that I have to take my second

470
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:35,504
列减去q1部分和那个
column subtract off the q1 part and that

471
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:38,354
可能很小所以我必须比较它
could be small so I have to compare it

472
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,104
同
with

473
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:42,614
哦，我没有，我没有写这个页面
oh I haven't I haven't written this page

474
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,864
所以我没有想到一个符号
up so I haven't got a notation in mind

475
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:45,435
然而
yet

476
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,284
让我，我不会，我不会给它一个名字我
let me I won't I won't give it a name I

477
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:54,764
还必须在此步骤之前计算
have to also compute at this step before

478
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,274
在决定q2之前决定这是非
deciding before deciding q2 this is non

479
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:06,404
描述如何决定q2如何
describing how do how to decide q2 the

480
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:11,294
第二矢量和我说，
second vector and I'm saying that the

481
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:15,254
决定q2的方法不仅仅是看
way to decide q2 is not only to look not

482
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,984
只有采取计件的A2也
only to take the piece of a2 but also

483
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:24,214
在这片作品A3的外观和
the piece of a3 look at this piece and

484
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:36,864
看看所有其他作品
look at all the other pieces

485
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:44,304
现在我的政策标准是什么
and now what will be my policy standard

486
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,104
克施密特接受了这个和
gram-schmidt accepted this one and

487
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:50,164
没看这些，但现在我要去了
didn't look at these but now I'm gonna

488
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:52,744
看看他们所有，我会采取的
look at them all and I'm gonna take the

489
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:56,134
最大的我要拿最大的
largest I'm gonna take the largest and

490
00:30:56,139 --> 00:31:00,364
这将是我想要的2想法
that will be a 2 thought I want so it

491
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:04,024
如果这个人是，那可能不是这个
might not be this one if this guy is

492
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,595
最大的我先是第3列
largest then I'm taking column 3 first

493
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,154
这将是我的a2，然后我会说
and that will be my a2 and then I'll say

494
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,815
细，然后Q2将是这一点，A2
fine and then Q 2 will be this that a2

495
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:21,174
在它的正常情况下你会看到差异
over its normal you see the difference

496
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,335
它并不令人兴奋，你可能会想到
it's not exciting and you might think

497
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,164
等一下，这是一个很大的问题
wait a minute this is a heck of a lot

498
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:31,354
更多的工作，但事实并非如此
more work but it isn't it isn't actually

499
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,114
更多的工作，因为这些都是
more work because these are all the

500
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,424
那些看起来像我们的东西
things these ones that look like we're

501
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:39,264
付出代价，我们正在计算所有这些
paying a price we're computing all these

502
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:42,424
替代方案，但我们必须这样做
alternatives but we had to do that

503
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:45,815
最后无论如何你看到了让我
eventually anyway do you see that let me

504
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,345
再说一遍这个标准
say it again and and that the standard

505
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:57,215
办法把所有的组件，如用于
way took all the components like for

506
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,075
这里有标准的方式等到你有了
here a standard way waited until you got

507
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,894
到第3列然后减去它
to column 3 and then subtract it off

508
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:08,435
两件作品等到你到达
both pieces waited until you got to

509
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,835
第4栏减去了三件
column 4 subtracted off three pieces

510
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,134
这样你就减掉了
this way you're subtracting off the

511
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:15,935
一旦你知道它是什么，第一件
first piece as soon as you know what it

512
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,004
一旦你知道q1你就应该
should be as soon as you know q1 you

513
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:23,554
从所有剩余的向量中删除它
remove it from all the remaining vectors

514
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,984
而且你希望看到最大的东西
and you look to sees what's the biggest

515
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:28,595
你选择我说过的最大的一个
you pick the biggest one I said maybe

516
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,384
是这个人所以你移动那个
it's this guy so you move that one

517
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:33,754
你是一些排列矩阵
you're some permutation matrix is going

518
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,484
将它移动到第二列看到它
to move it to the second column see it

519
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:38,884
从第三栏开始，但我是
started in the third column but I'm

520
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,715
要把它移到第二个，因为它是
gonna move it to the second because it's

521
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,544
最重要的是我做对了
the biggest then I do the right thing I

522
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:51,235
发现Q2现在我去
find q2 and now I go on

523
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,034
-先生
- sir

524
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:59,465
第三个急性或朝向q3以及如何
the third acute or toward q3 and how

525
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:04,235
我会找到q3，我会说橄榄我
will I find q3 it'll be I'll say olive I

526
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,065
想要挑选最大的专栏
want to pick the biggest column to work

527
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,255
所以我减去了q2组件
with so I subtract off the q2 components

528
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,595
这很容易说，但我从来没有
this is like easy to say but I had never

529
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,174
喜欢弄清楚之前让我来
liked figured it out before so let me

530
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,784
再说一遍然后我会离开
just say it again and then I'll leave

531
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:24,445
和你在一起我如何获得q3
that with you how do I get q3 I've got

532
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:30,835
我已修复了他们碰巧的两列
I've fixed two columns they happen to be

533
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,384
也许不一定是前两个但是
maybe not necessarily the first two but

534
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,725
两列两个队列设置，我是
two columns two queues are set and I'm

535
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,664
寻找下一个好吧，我继续
looking for the next one okay I go on

536
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:41,705
我看看剩下的所有专栏
and I look at all the remaining columns

537
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,554
所有这些都被减去了
all of which have had subtracted off

538
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,355
他们的q1和q2部分
their q1 and q2 parts

539
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,664
所以我与q1正交
so I've orthogonalize with respect to q1

540
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:54,544
和q2我看剩下的所有
and q2 I look at all the remaining

541
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:57,725
我必须与之合作并挑选的东西
things that I have to work with and pick

542
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,174
最大的就像挑选一样
the biggest just like picking the

543
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:03,695
进入枢轴的最大数量还可以
biggest number to go into the pivot okay

544
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,715
那就是我不认为我能说出来
that's that's I don't think I can say it

545
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,634
不再重复自己了
any more without just repeating myself

546
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,545
我把它带到课堂上，因为我
and I bring it here into class because I

547
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,394
我没有意识到这一点
had not sort of appreciated the point

548
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,564
没有额外的工作涉及到你
that that no extra work was involved you

549
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:24,414
刚做了这些减法
just did these subtraction off

550
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:29,104
所有剩余的减法
subtractions for all the remaining

551
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:33,814
你开始之前的一列
columns of a before you start on the

552
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:36,114
接下来的工作是好的
next job is that okay

553
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,624
最后这些笔记将描述这一点
eventually the notes will describe that

554
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:42,364
也许他们甚至做是的，我认为他们
maybe they even do yeah I think they

555
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:44,495
即使我写了它，但我没有
even do I wrote it but I didn't

556
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,414
现在明白了
understand it now

557
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:54,574
一点点改善没关系，是的，是的，是的
little improvement okay so yes yeah yeah

558
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,735
只有我们不称他们为枢纽或我们
only we don't call them pivots or we

559
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,145
应该也许我们应该，我不知道是什么
should maybe we should I don't know what

560
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,025
word用来获得最大的专栏
word is used to get the biggest column

561
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,785
其余
remaining

562
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,825
什么，是的，是的，是的
or something yeah yeah yeah each time

563
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,285
对吧，只是你知道是否列
right it's just you know if the columns

564
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,955
是在一个愚蠢的为了这使他们在
were in a stupid order this puts them in

565
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,275
正确的订单好吧终于来了
the right order okay finally come these

566
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,085
奇怪的名字叫喊俄罗斯没有
weird names cried off Russian are no the

567
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,455
实际上我不知道他不是我
actually I don't know what he isn't I

568
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,005
不应该承认在磁带上如此
shouldn't admit that on the tape so

569
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:32,025
那是什么意思
what's the what's the idea there so

570
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,235
再次，我们正在解决斧等于B上这
again we're solving ax equal B so this

571
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,505
什么是真的会被哭掉
is gonna be cried off what's what was

572
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,045
他的想法很好，我想解决斧头等于B
his idea well I want to solve ax equal B

573
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:50,505
a当然是一个非常大的矩阵我
a is a big matrix pretty big of course I

574
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,325
不打算反其道而行，将是
don't plan to invert it that would be

575
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:57,765
疯狂的我用大矩阵做什么a
insane what I can do with a big matrix a

576
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,225
特别是如果它很稀疏的话
especially if it's sparse which made it

577
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,825
使这将是一个大型稀疏一
so that that would be a large sparse a

578
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,405
会是一件好事会很好
would be a good would be a good

579
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:13,635
候选人克雷洛夫所以它是什么，
candidate for Krylov so what is it that

580
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,925
你可以用一个大的便宜和快速的我
you can do cheap and fast with a large I

581
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,985
意思是真的很大，但真的很稀疏
mean really large but really sparse

582
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:26,055
矩阵a你可以做矩阵乘以a
matrix a you can do a matrix times a

583
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,025
矢量，这是我们的矩阵，有
vector and here's our matrix and there's

584
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,475
我们的载体所以或者是的，我们可以开始
our vector so or yeah we could start

585
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,005
使用向量B，我们可以乘以一次
with a vector B we can multiply a times

586
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:42,465
B我们可以乘以B和B倍
B we can multiply a times a times B and

587
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,865
当然，我这样写，我从来没有
of course I write it that way I never I

588
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,315
从来没有我的意思，如果你乘以aa
never I mean like if you multiply a a

589
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,915
第一次，然后就像你知道的那样
times a first then like you know

590
00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:00,465
转到你的MATLAB账户吧
turn in your MATLAB account you just

591
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,785
必须这样做的
have to do it that way

592
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,245
好吧，然后你继续下去，其中
okay and then you keep going which of

593
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,345
当然这是一个平方B但你没有
course that's a squared B but you didn't

594
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,645
形成在一个平方，然后就高达
form a squared and then on up to in the

595
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,085
结束你得到一些说KK
end you get to some a to the say K K

596
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,104
减一
minus one

597
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:19,244
当然，这是计算为a
be but of course that's computed as a

598
00:37:19,249 --> 00:37:21,885
是前一个八次的时间
times the previous one which was eight

599
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,054
是前一次的，所以有一个
times the previous one so there is a

600
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:29,594
束，其很可能是载体的
bunch of vectors which are likely to be

601
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,975
独立，所以他们跨越空间
independent that so they span a space

602
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,534
它被称为Krylov空间
and it's called the Krylov space so

603
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:41,405
这些跨度是他们的组合
there's these span they're combinations

604
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,244
组合
combinations

605
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:46,215
给，给
give-give

606
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,784
哦，我不喜欢那封信K因为那是
oh I don't like that letter K cuz that's

607
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:54,405
还有Krylov所以我该怎么说J所以我
also Krylov so what shall I say J so I

608
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,244
有J矢量z'原始BaBa
have J vector z' the original B a B a

609
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:02,375
将B平方组合起来
squared B up to that so combinations

610
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:13,064
给Krylov空间说它会命名
give the Krylov space say it will name

611
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:15,165
在哭泣之后，我们需要我们
it after crying off and we need we need

612
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,324
下标J表示它有多大
a subscript J to show how big it is it's

613
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:26,824
因此，这将是一个想法
dimension so so that will be the idea

614
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:30,705
让我完成这个想法的想法
well let me complete the idea the idea

615
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,435
将是如此组合所以这是一个
will be so there combination so that's a

616
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,524
空间的子空间蛮大的，如果我们做，如果
space a subspace pretty big if we do if

617
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:43,064
J是很大的，我要去看看了
J is big and I'm going to look for the

618
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:48,854
在那个空间的最佳解决方案，所以我要去
best solution in that space so I'm going

619
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,195
我不打算解决等于B的斧头
to I'm not going to solve ax equal B

620
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,754
我确切地想找到最好的解决方案
exactly I'm gonna find the best solution

621
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:58,395
最接近的解是最小二乘法
the closest solution the least square

622
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,205
在这个Krylov空间的解决方案我会
solution in this Krylov space I'm gonna

623
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,024
让J变大，所以这个空间有
let J be pretty big so this space has

624
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:08,774
有很多载体我有一个
got plenty of vectors in it I have a

625
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:15,524
这个空间的基础是我和一些人
basis for this space what I and some

626
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:17,955
这些基础向量的组合将
combination of these basis vectors will

627
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:26,495
是我的XJ所以我再次XJ将是最好的
be my X J so I again XJ will be the best

628
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,834
矢量或最接近的矢量最接近的
vector or the closest vector the closest

629
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:38,715
矢量在这个Krylov空间KJ的赌注
vector in this Krylov space KJ the bet

630
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,364
将是该领域的最佳载体
will be the best vector in that space

631
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:44,415
最近的一个，所以我知道空间是什么
the closest one so I know what the space

632
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,985
我把尺寸缩小到了J.
is I've reduced the dimension down to J

633
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:54,675
我可以找到这个最佳的因素还有的
and I can find this best factor there's

634
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,045
只有一个捕获，它是相同的捕获
just one catch and it's the same catch

635
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,745
我们的目标是帮助克格施密特
that gram-schmidt we're aiming to help

636
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:09,844
删除这是我的基础
to to remove that is this basis that I'm

637
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,985
现在我和所有人一起工作
right now I'm working with all

638
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,525
这些家伙和那些人的组合
combinations of these guys and those

639
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,925
可能是非常非常依赖可能
could be very very dependent that might

640
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,295
随时随地成为一个糟糕的基础
be a terrible basis anytime you wanted

641
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,475
至
to

642
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,465
重大计算是什么样的基础
big computations what kind of a basis do

643
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:33,705
你想要是的，那么基础是什么
you want yes so what sort of a basis is

644
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,755
很高兴找到投资找到
good to find to project on to to find

645
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,745
该子空间内的最佳解决方案
the best solution within that subspace

646
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,245
所以你有点想要投射
so you're sort of finding a projection

647
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:48,314
而且你已经拥有了矢量
and you've got you've got vectors that

648
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,834
跨越空间让你知道你是什么
span the space so you know what you're

649
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:56,745
投射到那些矢量可能
projecting on to but those vectors might

650
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:01,035
不是他们可能几乎依赖
not be they might be nearly dependent

651
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,165
他们可能都指向了几乎
they might all be pointing almost the

652
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,045
同样的方向你的情况
same direction in which case your

653
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,165
计算很可怕所以你呢
calculations are terrible so what do you

654
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:16,245
做正确的，然后是正确的
do orthe orthogonalize right and that's

655
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,555
我们的nolde进来的地方就在那里
where our nolde comes in and there's

656
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:26,205
也是一个名叫LAN的匈牙利人
also a Hungarian guy named LAN shows so

657
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,275
他们贡献的是如何做到的
that's what they contribute is how to

658
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,665
将该基础正交化然后一次
orthogonalize that basis and then once

659
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,525
你做到了
you've done that you

660
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,345
有一个正交的基础，当然
have an orthogonal basis and of course

661
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,055
正交基础是完美的做法
an orthogonal basis is perfect to do a

662
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,435
投影你看到每个人都必须这样做
projection do you see everybody has to

663
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,435
知道为什么这是正交基础
know that why is an orthogonal basis so

664
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,925
伟大的正统甚至让我们只是
great orthonormal even let's just

665
00:41:53,930 --> 00:42:00,405
记得假设我有一个向量X它
remember suppose I have a vector X it's

666
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,655
这里不知道，但假设我想我
unknown here but suppose I suppose I

667
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,025
有它，我想将它写为我们
have it and I want to write it as our

668
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:14,205
这些正统人员的组合如此
combination of these orthonormal guys so

669
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:20,165
你说是啊是什么样的
you say yeah what is it about

670
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,025
正交Q的，使这个容易
orthonormal Q's that makes this easy to

671
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,995
做它不会与a
do which it would not be with a

672
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,455
任意的基础，所以这是真的
arbitrary basis so this this is really

673
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,125
可爱我看到这个向量的Q倍
cute I'm see right Q times this vector

674
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,535
C'S列的Q的Q的是在
of C's column the Q the Q's are in the

675
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,295
Q的列是C的，我们乘以a
columns of Q the C's we're multiplying a

676
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,205
矩阵由一个矢量，这是好的
matrix by a vector that's just okay it's

677
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,975
列的组合是什么
a combination of the columns that's what

678
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,025
我们得到了什么是什么时候
we get and what's the point of when

679
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,455
当Q是正交的时候
these when the Q's are orthogonal

680
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,305
我们能得到答案的答案是什么？
what's the answer we can get the answer

681
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,835
马上所以我们在这里我们试图
straight away so we here we're trying to

682
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,505
我们试图找到系数
we're trying to find the coefficients

683
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,235
关于a的基矢量Q.
with respect to the basis vectors Q of a

684
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,225
给出向量X，答案是什么
given vector X and what's the answer to

685
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,065
这一问题的点通常是
that question the point is usually to

686
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,305
找到它们必须的系数
find their coefficients C would have to

687
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,215
是Q逆X我们必须解决这个问题
be Q inverse X we'd have to solve that

688
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,425
我们必须解决的方程组
system of equations we do have to solve

689
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,825
那个方程组但是什么
that system of equations but what

690
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,165
哪里是收益或思想
where's the payoff from or thought

691
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:36,015
whoresonnormalbasisqinverse是Q.
whoreson normal basis q inverse is Q

692
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,895
转移那是收益，所以它是
transpose that's the payoff so it's

693
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,955
告诉我
telling me

694
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,375
那找到c1我怎么找到c1这个
that to find c1 how do I find c1 this

695
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,225
这说是先进行q1转置
this says take the first q1 transpose

696
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,285
用X，我会在这里说同样的话
with X that I'll say the same thing here

697
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,255
把第一个组件作为第一个组件
take the first component the first

698
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,425
向量与X的关系将是关于c1Q1
vector with X that'll be about c1 Q 1

699
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,155
转置Q1我只是拿点
transpose Q 1 I'm just taking the dot

700
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,495
Q1和Q的一切产品
product of everything there with Q 1 and

701
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,645
然后是C2Q1转置Q2，依此类推
then a C 2 Q 1 transpose Q 2 and so on

702
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,375
但有什么好再告诉我的
but what's good it tell me again the

703
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:24,695
这些都是0，Q1转置Q.
these are all 0 and the Q 1 transpose Q

704
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,465
1是1所以它是完美的C1是Q1
1 is 1 so it's perfect C 1 is Q 1

705
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,735
转置X，这就是那个
transpose X and that's exactly what that

706
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,605
告诉我们的第一个组件是
tells us the first component is the

707
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:40,445
第一行Q转置，即Q1
first row of Q transpose which is Q 1

708
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:47,525
转换X是的，所以这是主意
transpose with X yeah so that's the idea

709
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,485
所以这就是这个想法在这里
so that's the idea here

710
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,235
这就是我们的nolde和lan的原因
that's the reason for our nolde and lan

711
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,315
显示出名的是他们的想法
shows being famous is that they figured

712
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,575
找出正交化的好方法
out a good way to orthogonalize that

713
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:11,995
基础是啊是啊我们想看看是什么
basis yeah yeah do we want to see what

714
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,755
他们做了或只是那些将在
they did or just those would be in the

715
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,195
注意到它是如何做到这一点的
notes it's a well how do you do it so

716
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,925
这是我们不好的基础
this is the basis this is our not good

717
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:27,755
基础，然后我们的良好基础正在进行
basis and then our good basis is going

718
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,995
要Q，所以我会把B作为Q1的意思
to be Q's so I'll take B to be Q 1 will

719
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,825
什么是正确的选择
be what what would be the right choice

720
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:40,775
对于Q1井，我将采用第一个向量
for Q 1 well I'll take the first vector

721
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:46,415
并规范它，但它只是我们只是
and normalize it but it just we're just

722
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,005
这样做的施密特会是什么Q的
doing gram-schmidt what would q to be

723
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,635
我怎么能找到Q2
how would I find Q 2 following the

724
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,235
克施密特的想法
gram-schmidt idea

725
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,505
我将BI减去其组件
I take a B I subtract off its component

726
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:06,844
在这个q1方向，我正常化和
in this q1 direction and I normalize and

727
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:10,425
他们都没有Leland显示算法
all they are no Leland shows algorithm

728
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,735
就是那个克-施密特的想法
is is that same gram-schmidt idea

729
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:20,415
应用于这些Krylov载体也是如此
applied to these Krylov vectors so so so

730
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,084
我们都知道土地表演没有租约
are know the land shows are no lease for

731
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:25,065
a的任何矩阵和LAN选择
any matrix and LAN choices for a

732
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,045
对称矩阵，你得到一些
symmetric matrix where you get some

733
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,965
特别的好处所以他们所做的只是
special benefit so what they did is just

734
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:36,125
你现在可以说他们刚刚写下来了
you could say now they just wrote down

735
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:41,655
事实上，克施密特可能上涨了
gram-schmidt in fact probably up the

736
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,145
标准克施密特，因为我们这是
standard gram-schmidt because we this is

737
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,215
我们真的不想要的情况
a case where we really don't want to

738
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,415
交换列
exchange columns

739
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,015
我不想突然被推入
I don't want suddenly to be pushed into

740
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,645
这个我宁愿把它们整理好
this one I'd rather take them in order

741
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,015
因为它恰好是正确的
because it just turns out right and that

742
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,295
这是在说明中，让我告诉你
that this is in the note so let me tell

743
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,385
你在哪里这将是部分
you where this is this would be section

its fourth edition it's the Bible for

773
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,605
所有数值线性代数人和
all numerical linear algebra people and

774
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:08,865
它是由golem和vanloan编写的
it's written by golem and van loans so
