好的，我们走了
okay here we go

10
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:29,655
今天的所有设置和两个主题是
all set and two topics for today one is

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,935
回到SRA教授的演讲
to go back to Professor SRA's lecture

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,315
这是上周五，他答应了
that was last Friday and he promised a

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,245
定理和证明，今天早上他
theorem and proof and this morning he

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,025
把它发给我，这就是收敛
sent it to me so it's the convergence

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,275
它证明了它的融合
it's proving the convergence of

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,095
随机梯度下降和真的
stochastic gradient descent and really

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,815
什么是重要的可能和有用的不是
what's important maybe and useful is not

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,695
这么多的证明细节
so much the details of the proof which

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,925
我只是学习但是假设
I'm just learning but the assumptions

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,444
你知道这里的逻辑是什么
you know what's the logic here what do

21
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,555
你必须假设渐变到
you have to assume about the gradient to

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,245
以及获得该算法的算法
and about the algorithm to get the

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,375
回答，但现在我回头看
answer and but now I actually look back

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,315
在他的演讲视频中，它是
at the video of his lecture and it was

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,335
优秀的，我看它有
excellent and as I look at it there were

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,185
讲座后面的几件事
a couple of things later in the lecture

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,635
我认为会做出很好的项目
that I thought would make good projects

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,695
所以我不知道是否有人仍然开放
so I don't know if anybody is still open

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,345
如何在项目上做什么，但在这里
to what to do on a project but here here

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,525
是我的两个想法，如果你是的话
are my two ideas and and if you if

31
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,875
你已经完成了你的项目
you've already finished your project

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,364
通过考虑其中一个来获得A+
well get an A+ by considering one of

33
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:55,305
这些让你记住，这将是
these so you remember and this will

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,885
提醒你讲课的内容
remind you of the of the lecture which

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,065
是一件好事，所以你记得那个
is a good thing so you remember that

36
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,095
问题一是是否在
question one was whether in the

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,275
随机部分你做完之后
stochastic part do you after you've

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,114
取样
sampled

39
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,384
一个或一些小批量，但让我们只是
one or some mini batch but let's just

40
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,124
说一个
say one

41
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,994
损失函数来自一个
of the loss functions coming from one

42
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,094
样本你还记得整点
sample you remember the whole point is

43
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,684
如果我们做的所有zillions样品
that if we do all zillions samples at

44
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:26,354
每次迭代我们真的很慢
every iteration we're really really slow

45
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:30,555
所以随机的想法是随机的
so the stochastic idea is to randomly

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,085
挑选一个或一小批样品
pick one or a mini batch of the samples

47
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,824
并且只是减少他们的损失就交易
and and just reduce their loss just deal

48
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:43,005
与他们的损失说平方损失
with their the loss say the square loss

49
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,634
或者稍后我们会看到交叉熵损失
or later we'll see cross-entropy loss

50
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,574
但无论成本如何，只需做一些
but whatever the cost is just do a few

51
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,294
或一个然后问题是在之后
or one and then the question was after

52
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,094
你完成了那个你把它放回去的那个
you've done that one you put it back in

53
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,204
锅和你每次品尝
the pot and every time you sample over

54
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,874
整个系列，但那是
the whole collection but that's

55
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,904
贵或者你只是列出一个
expensive or do you just make a list of

56
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,055
所有的随机顺序的随机列表
random list of random order of all the

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,654
样品并通过它们
samples and go through them which is

58
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,835
然后没有替换，这是排序
then without replacement which is sort

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,814
那是半非法的
of semi illegal that is the the the

60
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:32,474
随机化中的逻辑问你
logic in in the randomization asks you

61
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,624
每次更换，但没有人这样做
to replace every time but nobody does it

62
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:39,014
等待成本可能不值得
wait costs a lot probably not worth it

63
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,404
所以这个项目就是你想的
so the project would be suppose you take

64
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:46,115
一千或说一百
a thousand or say just a hundred hundred

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,574
随机数字说你用MATLAB
random numbers say say you use MATLAB

66
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,745
随机只是命令R，所以你得到
random just the command R and so you get

67
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,794
R和平均数为一半的数字
numbers whose averages a half from R and

68
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,064
他们介于0和1之间，所以我们知道什么
they're between 0 & 1 ok so we know what

69
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,574
平均值是让我们计算两个
the average is so let's compute it two

70
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:13,544
一种方法是不更换，那就是
ways one is by not replacing and that's

71
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,014
有趣的人，你这么做
the interesting one do you so so to take

72
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,714
一百个样本我猜我们知道
a hundred samples well I guess we know

73
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,055
在我们完成之后
that after we've got through the full

74
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,355
百我们准备得到的
hundred we're gonna get exactly the

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,255
现在
right now

76
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,414
但无论如何我的问题是
but anyway there my question would be

77
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,555
多大的差别，你看到在
how much difference do you see in in the

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,375
最终的方法所以法律规模很大
eventual approach so the law of large

79
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,224
数字我想我们会告诉我们得到一个
numbers I guess would tell us we get a

80
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:48,495
这些数字的平均值为1/2
average of 1/2 for these numbers with

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,795
均匀分布在0和1之间
uniform distribution between 0 and 1

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,595
我应该在这里写任何东西吗？
should I be writing anything here

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,615
也许我应该没事，所以我就是这样
maybe I should okay so I'm this is

84
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:09,224
项目一个你选择数字K哪个
project one you pick numbers a K which

85
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:17,284
R是R并且从R开始均匀地在01上
is R and from R and so uniformly on 0 1

86
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:24,075
001，然后将我的问题是什么
0 0 1 and then I my question is what

87
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,414
关于收敛到最后的
about convergence to the the final the

88
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,895
平均值是1/2
average is 1/2

89
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,295
它说可能是一个简单的例子，但是
it says maybe too simple an example but

90
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,085
我们可以看到的会发生什么
could we see what happens for the

91
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:44,955
和你一样的平均收敛
convergence of the average as you either

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,594
做替换或不做替换
do replacements or don't do replacements

93
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:50,445
然后其实我想看一个
and then in fact I would like to see a

94
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,015
看起来像他的那些人
figure that looks like those in his

95
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,865
讲课记得了，他开始了它
lecture t remember he started it

96
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,315
在某处开始然后在这里
somewhere start and then here's the

97
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,365
完成，但你记得那是随机的
finish but you remember that stochastic

98
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,435
梯度下降有点漂亮
gradient descent was kind of a pretty

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,465
一开始就很有效了
effective at the beginning well the

100
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,115
开始那些可能是一百
beginning those might be a hundred

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,914
迭代每一个Epoque一个运行
iterations each one Epoque one one run

102
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,645
通过完整的数字，然后当它
through the full number but then when it

103
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,905
它开始越来越近了
got to here got closer it started

104
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,025
振作起来，你记得他确定了
oscillating you remember he identified

105
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,855
事物周围的混乱区域
the region of confusion around the thing

106
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,145
我的建议只是我认为那些
well my suggestion is just I think those

107
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,455
您可以访问视频
videos should be accessible to you on

108
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,895
他们是恒星，所以我很乐意
are they on stellar yeah so I'd love to

109
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:53,504
看到那种行为有些好
see that behavior in some some good

110
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,395
这种行为的例子和一些
examples of that behavior and some

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,795
要使用的图片，这将是一个
pictures to use so that would be one

112
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,795
和安德烈斯的想法哦，是的也是
idea with Andres oh yeah that's also

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,914
想法的想法是好的开始
idea to idea to is the is the good start

114
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,595
再坏的结束为一个随机
and then the bad finish for a stochastic

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,025
渐变血统，当然还有魔力
gradient descent and of course the magic

116
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,615
即使没有这个魔法的话
words in even without this the magic

117
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,305
单词和计算是提前停止
words and computations is early stopping

118
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:36,465
我们不太适合所以我们想要
we we don't over fit so we wanted to

119
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,944
无论如何早点停下来，提前停下来
stop early anyway and early stopping

120
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,775
就像一个好主意一样
just as like a good idea

121
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,645
因为如果那是什么，那就是
for if that's what if that's what the

122
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,555
接近X星的那个
approach to the to the X star that

123
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,075
你正在寻找这将是
you're looking for the this would be the

124
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,765
地方，这就是这X
place where the this is where that's X

125
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,654
我们是毕业生F和X星的明星
star where we're grad F and X star is

126
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,935
哦，这就是最低点
near oh that's that's the minimum point

127
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,125
那个Arg男人究竟是男人
that's Arg men are men exactly what

128
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,944
我们正在寻找的，我们并不觉得
we're looking for and we don't find it

129
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:16,784
很好
very well

130
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,974
但我们接近它快好了2
but we get close to it fast okay two

131
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:28,125
关于项目的想法，所以也许我会
ideas on project so just so maybe I'll

132
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,985
转到今天主题的主题
go to the main topic of today the topic

133
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,615
我答应了反向传播的想法
I promised the idea of back propagation

134
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:45,945
计算这一切都是为了计算
to compute this is all to compute

135
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,725
gradF梯度所有的导数
grad F the gradient all the derivatives

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:09:02,125
这是DFDX1到DFDXM
this is this is the DF DX 1 to DF DX M

137
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:12,055
也许我会说我有MM功能的地方
maybe I'll say where I have M M features

138
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,015
forfor是为了样品好，所以这是
for for is for the sample okay so that's

139
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,555
反向传播就是这样
back propagation and that's the thing

140
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,225
它的发现或重新发现放
whose discovery or rediscovery put

141
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,455
没有那个的地图上的神经网络
neural nets on the map without that's

142
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,435
当然要找到关键的计算方法
the key calculation of course to find

143
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,985
最陡下降的梯度
the gradient in the steepest descent

144
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,535
算法每一步都需要一个渐变
algorithm every step needs a gradient

145
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,735
如果你不能快速计算它
and if you can't compute it quickly

146
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,895
你是个坏人，但是你
you're you're in bad shape so but you

147
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,975
可以通过这种自动计算它
can compute it quickly by this automatic

148
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,235
反向模式的区别
differentiation in Reverse mode which is

149
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,565
否则我不认为那些
otherwise known those I don't think that

150
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,235
人们也许Hinton是第一个
people maybe Hinton was the first was

151
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:11,575
在深入发展的领导者
the leader in in the in developing deep

152
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,815
神经网络深度学习和他
neural nets deep learning and he

153
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,875
实现了，所以我给了他很大的荣誉
realized so I give him big credit for

154
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,395
该反传会工作，
that back propagation would work and

155
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,655
会给他快速的渐变但是它
would give him fast gradients but it

156
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,215
实际上之前已经研究过
actually had been studied before under

157
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,455
名称ad自动区分所以
the name ad automatic differentiation so

158
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,055
优点只是告诉你这个想法
merit just tell you that idea

159
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,355
有些人可能知道它可能知道
some of you may know it may know about

160
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,105
它可能比我更了解并且可能知道
it may know more than I and might know

161
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,325
好的网站看到这个
good a good website to see this

162
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,585
描述
description

163
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,345
当然还有一部分
there'll be of course a section of the

164
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,945
已经是你的笔记了
book of the notes already you you

165
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,215
已经拥有了它部分，这是
already have it section this is

166
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,205
在7.2中这是深入的章节
in 7.2 so this is the chapter on deep

167
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,805
学习和第一部分是关于
learning and the first section was about

168
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,865
你记得X的结构
the structure of f of X and you remember

169
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,935
关于f结构的关键点
the key point about the structure of f

170
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,045
X是我会从X和开始
of X is that it would I start with X and

171
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,585
应用X的一些函数f1和那个
apply some function f1 of X and to that

172
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,915
我应用了X的一些函数f2
I apply some function f2 of X and to

173
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,725
我应用了F3F3的一些功能
that I apply some function of F 3 F 3 of

174
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,785
XF的1F2，这就是事情
F 2 of F 1 of X and that's the thing

175
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,835
我需要的衍生物，所以我只是
whose derivative I need so I'll just

176
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,325
拿你熟悉的普通衍生物
take ordinary derivative you know well

177
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,305
偏导数真的是因为我
partial derivatives really because I

178
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,915
是的，我最好说的偏导数，以便
yeah I better say partial derivatives so

179
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:51,945
假设X是一对XY的例子
suppose X is a pair XY example so so

180
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,135
在这里让我通过例子向你展示
here let me show you by example so

181
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:03,585
假设X的f让我采取简单的方法
suppose f of X is let me take a simple

182
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:12,045
示例X立方倍X加2y即可
example X cubed times X plus 2y okay so

183
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,625
我想以这种方式思考这个功能
I want to think of that function the way

184
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,345
任何人都会像建造一样
anybody would as being built as the

185
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,675
两个功能的产品，所以有一个
product of two functions so there's a

186
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,215
产品规则进入衍生品
product rule to get into the derivative

187
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,845
然后我们需要每个的衍生物
and then we need the derivatives of each

188
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,475
因此，有一个权力规则和一个
piece so there's a power rule and a

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,975
线性和线性组合规则
linear and a linear combination rule so

190
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,895
它有一些我们使用的规则
it's got a few of the rules that we use

191
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:44,265
并且重点是思考
and point is to think about the

192
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,145
X和f的f的计算
computation of f of X and the

193
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,545
DFDX的计算和计算
computation of DF DX and the computation

194
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,145
DFTY是那些衍生物
of DFT Y those are the derivatives that

195
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,915
我们需要这是我们需要的功能
we need this is the function we need and

196
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,945
如何快速完成这些计算
how to do those computations quickly

197
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:09,005
好的，这是第7.2节我
okay so and this is section 7.2 which I

198
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,774
从中受益匪浅
which benefited a lot from

199
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:17,175
博客我不是博客读者或博客
a blog I'm not a blog reader or a blog

200
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:23,355
作家，但不知何故，我发现这个博客，
writer but somehow I found this blog so

201
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:32,584
让我把它的克里斯托弗
let me put its Christopher

202
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,425
奥拉夫是他的名字，他真的写道
Olaf is his name and he's really writes

203
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,024
清除事情让他做出贡献
to clear things so he he he contributes

204
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,785
他为一家大公司工作
he works for one of the big companies

205
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,595
你知道更深入的研究吗？
and does you know the deeper research

206
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,954
但他也是一个非常好的暴露者
but he's also a really good expose etre

207
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,814
他现在使用的网站是
and the the website that he now uses is

208
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:01,064
叫做蒸馏点什么，但我想
called distill dot something but I think

209
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:05,024
也许这个博客是较早之前的
maybe this blog was earlier before the

210
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,605
开始蒸馏，但可能会加载
start of distill but it might be loaded

211
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,905
到提制反正就是这样的地方
onto distill anyway that's that's where

212
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,314
我得到了这个简单的描述
I got this simple description of

213
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,495
反向传播让我们做微积分
backpropagation let's just do calculus

214
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,735
首先，如果我有一个
for first of all if I just have a

215
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,985
甚至一个变量的功能
function of maybe even one variable

216
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,374
DFDX的衍生物是什么？
what's the derivative what is DF DX here

217
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,954
只是想要记住是什么
just to realize just to remember what is

218
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:30,254
它
it

219
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,655
我们必须做什么计算DFDX
what calculation we have to do so DF DX

220
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,274
这是n等于一个变量所以
this is with n equal one one variable so

221
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,064
我会使用普通衍生物而不是
I'll I use ordinary derivative and not

222
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,884
偏导数，但这是什么
partial derivative but this is then what

223
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,264
我这就是真的有工作要做，但
I that's what really has to be done but

224
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,694
那是什么的衍生物
just what's the derivative of that of a

225
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:59,384
当然，功能链很好
chain of functions well of course the

226
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,204
链规则所以椅子是什么的
chain rule so the chair what does the

227
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:09,754
连锁规则说我区分f3我
chain rule say I differentiate f3 I

228
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,574
不知道是什么我也很好，我把
don't know what do I well well I put

229
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,405
它与...有所区别
that it's differentiated with respect to

230
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,644
f3DF3df2就是我应该放的
f3 DF 3 d f2 is that what I should put

231
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,315
好
ok

232
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,515
我在哪里评估该衍生物
and where do I evaluate that derivative

233
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:37,105
所以是的，所以我不在X评价它
so so so yeah I don't evaluate it at X

234
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,225
对，我是不同的有效F-所以
right I'm different effective F - so do

235
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,535
我在F的F到X这个评估它
I evaluate it at F to of F 1 of X this

236
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,885
是链规则得到一点点的地方
is where the chain rule gets a little

237
00:15:51,890 --> 00:16:00,435
cheney好吧那我们知道DF2DF1
cheney okay then we know that DF 2 DF 1

238
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,405
现在又在F1处进行了评估
and again that's now evaluated at F 1 of

239
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:10,725
X然后最终因子是DF1是X.
X and then the final factor is DF 1 be X

240
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,475
在X评估我们是什么
evaluated at X that's somehow what we

241
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,745
必须做，这只是一个
have to do and that's just for an

242
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,255
普通的一个变量函数和我
ordinary one variable function and I

243
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,505
这里有两个变量函数和
have here a two variable function and

244
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,175
深度学习有一百万变量
deep learning has a million variable

245
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,845
功能所以我想我们不会去
function so let's I think we won't go to

246
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,105
一百万，但我们可以管理两个让我们
a million but two we can manage so let's

247
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,955
让我们来计算那些让我们计算的东西吧
let's let's compute those let's compute

248
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:53,515
该函数首先计算F所以
the function first of all compute F so

249
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,535
我给了X等于2和y等于说
I'm given X equal say 2 and y equals say

250
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:08,505
3，我将创造一个什么样的
3 and what do I'm gonna create a

251
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,074
计算图所以这只是为了
computational graph so this is just to

252
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,215
画画，所以我确实要走绘制
draw so I'm actually going to draw the

253
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:26,634
计算图
computational graph

254
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:35,435
为4f计算然后它将是
to compute for for 4f and then it'll be

255
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,744
找到该图的变体
a variation of that graph to find the

256
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:41,164
衍生品，但让我们开始吧
derivatives but so let's just start with

257
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:44,705
该图首先为该函数
the graph first of all for the function

258
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,075
因为我们将再次需要它
because we're gonna need that so again

259
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,215
这是X立方但这么好吧，我写的
it's X cubed but so okay I write that

260
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:57,475
再次功能X立方次X加2y
function again X cubed times X plus 2y

261
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,114
所以我认为我们要迈出第一步
so I think we're going to the first step

262
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,904
将找到X加X立方体
will be to find X plus X cubed that

263
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:12,065
因素将是8，我们必须
factor which will be 8 and we have to

264
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,624
找到另一个因素X加2y然后
find the other factor X plus 2y so then

265
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,715
我要去那里使用Y和X这些
I'm going to that uses Y and X so these

266
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,465
是其向前发展的有向图
are its a directed graph going forward

267
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,185
用这个计算使得X加2y
with this computation so X plus 2 y

268
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,935
等于它是两个和六个哦
equals whatever it is two and six oh

269
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,965
八再没有辉煌
eight again not brilliant

270
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:43,975
我在这里要改变的是3y3y
what shall I change here make it 3 y 3y

271
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,494
只是在这里所以得到不同数量
just to get a different number here so

272
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:51,485
现在X是2y是3我得到11这是一个很好的
now X is 2 y is 3 I get 11 that's a good

273
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,424
数
number

274
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:03,514
好到目前为止这么好，现在是下一步
ok so far so good and now the next step

275
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,855
在这张图上将是我有一个
on this graph will be to I have a

276
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,845
那些将要去的产品
product of those so that will go to the

277
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:21,294
产品F等于1188的8倍
product F equals 8 times 1188

278
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,195
好的，所以我们得到答案88你愿意吗？
ok so we've got the answer 88 would you

279
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,065
通常我不会那么乱
which mess normally I wouldn't take that

280
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,235
计算F的大部分书
much of a book to compute F

281
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,504
我会说2个立方次2加3
I would have said 2 cubed times 2 plus 3

282
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:43,744
第3次，我已经简化了
times 3 and I'd have simplified that to

283
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:51,124
8次11，如果是的话，我会得到88次
8 times 11 and I would have got 88 so if

284
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:53,614
我们只是正常写作会
we were just writing normally that would

285
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:57,304
做到这一点，但是这是对图片
do it but this is the picture of the

286
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,554
计算图确定好不错
computational graph ok good good good

287
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,674
现在它是衍生品的两个衍生品
now it's the derivatives two derivatives

288
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,304
假设我们在fdy中找到FDX
to find the F DX in the f dy suppose we

289
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,935
先行前进
go forward first

290
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,855
我的观点将会是伟大的
my point is going to be or the great

291
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,884
重点是落后是更好的逆转
point is that backward is better reverse

292
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:20,764
模式更好，但我们不知道是什么
mode is better but we don't know what

293
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:22,774
这意味着直到我们向前迈进
that means until we've gone forward so

294
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:25,355
让我继续前进，所以现在我要走了
let me go forward so now I'm gonna go

295
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,815
向前
forward

296
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,364
[掌声]
[Applause]

297
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:41,034
那么我们怎样才能让FDX好呢
so what do we what let's do the F DX ok

298
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,134
每个人都对DFDX有所了解
everybody's up for DF DX the partial

299
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:48,605
衍生规格2x所以这里我们有X.
derivative spec 2x so here we have X

300
00:20:48,610 --> 00:21:00,735
等于2和y等于3
equal 2 and y equals 3

301
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:08,575
好的，然后我必须认为我采取
okay and then I've got to figure I take

302
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,115
该步骤的衍生物是第一个
the derivative of that step the first

303
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,715
步骤是X2x立方，所以我需要
step was X 2x cubed so I need the

304
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,735
衍生广告的全部意义在于
derivative the whole point of ad is that

305
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,875
计算的每次计算
the computation every computation of a

306
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,115
衍生品像这样打破了
derivative breaks down like this and a

307
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,235
非常简单的作品和衍生品
very simple pieces and the derivatives

308
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,695
那些简单的部分也很简单
of those simple pieces are also simple

309
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,815
碎片所以重点是打破
pieces so the whole point is to break

310
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,305
要适当地替换那里
the to replace appropriately the there

311
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:48,565
是那些中间步骤
was those intermediate steps with

312
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,265
导数，以便计算X.
derivatives so so as to compute the X

313
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,395
所以我必须使用这个事实
derivative so so I have to use the fact

314
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,865
x的导数与...相关
that the derivative of x cubed with

315
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,055
尊重X哦我最好做偏
respect to X oh I better do partial

316
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,905
X立方体的衍生部分凹槽
derivative partial grooves of X cubed

317
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,315
加标2x或3x平方所以现在我就是我
spiked 2x or 3x squared so now I'll I'm

318
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,955
抱歉，可能是一个公式，然后是一个
sorry up put maybe a formula and then a

319
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,715
号码，以便给出给出3倍
number so that gives that gives 3 times

320
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,725
412和x立方的衍生物
4 12 and the derivative of x cubed with

321
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:38,815
尊重Y给出0然后再给出
respect to Y gives 0 right and then the

322
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,365
导数所以我正在做X衍生物
derivative so I'm doing the X derivative

323
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,415
所以Y的导数相对于X.
so the derivative of Y with respect to X

324
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:54,535
如果我是的，你能告诉我吗？
is you get to tell me if I'm if I'm

325
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,365
计算偏导数是0是0
computing partial derivatives is 0 is 0

326
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,805
Y和X是独立的，就是这样
Y and X are independent and that's this

327
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,135
在我看来，原因，
is the reason in my view that the

328
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,485
前进的方法是浪费，因为
forward method is is wasteful because

329
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,165
我要做另一个
I'm gonna have to do another

330
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,125
其他y导数的图表
graph for the y derivative in other

331
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,675
跟踪跟踪x的单词
words tracking the tracking the x

332
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,825
衍生品从来没有很多东西
derivatives a whole lot of stuff never

333
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,395
离开地面，所以它永远不应该
got off the ground so it never should

334
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,625
无论如何都看着它，但我做到了
have looked at it so anyway but I do

335
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,545
需要
need

336
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:41,695
我会有这个X加3y所以也许我
I'll have this X plus 3y so maybe I

337
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,555
不知道是否消除，我认为
don't know whether to erase that I think

338
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,375
我只是因为我不知道该怎么做
I will just because I don't know what to

339
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,955
是的，所以现在就让我吧
do with it there yeah so now now let me

340
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,095
拿那些我真正需要的是
take the ones that I really need is

341
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,425
关于x加X的导数
derivative with respect to X of x plus

342
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:09,925
3Y为1，因此，让我
3y which is 1 and so that gives me the

343
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:17,395
回答1对任何X实际上还好，现在
answer 1 for any X actually okay and now

344
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,325
什么
what

345
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,975
哦，我是的，我真的不需要这些
oh I yeah I'm really I don't need these

346
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,095
这是浪费时间不是吗
the this is a waste of time isn't it

347
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,415
是否只有我想要的X衍生物
is it only X derivatives I want anyway

348
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,865
让我们继续吧
let's just keep going

349
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,665
你可以看到这需要一点点
you can see this takes a little

350
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,935
组织，我没有练习
organization and I'm not practiced with

351
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,575
它所以我要做什么我正在寻找
it so what am I going to do I'm looking

352
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,145
对于我的X衍生得使用
for the X derivative of I've got to use

353
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,815
现在我找到了产品规则X.
a product rule now I found the X

354
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,985
该因子的导数是X的12
derivative of that factor was 12 the X

355
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,975
该因子的导数是1，现在
derivative of this factor is 1 and now

356
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,105
产品的X衍生物也是如此
the X derivative of the product so so

357
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,275
现在我要做某种产品规则
now I'm gonna do a somehow product rule

358
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:15,475
这个产品的X衍生物我
the the X derivative of this product I

359
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,265
给这两个术语起一个名字
sort of given these two terms a name

360
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,505
让我打电话让我先打个电话
let let me call let me call that first

361
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,945
术语X立方体和第二个术语
term X cube and the second term

362
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,895
x+31：f所以我会称之为两个
x + 3 1 : f so I'll call that the two

363
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,785
这两个术语CNS所以我现在需要得到我
the two terms CNS so I now need to get I

364
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,295
现在需要得到这样的CD
now need to get so that's the CD s this

365
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,235
是DCDX这是DCDX和这个
is DC DX right this is DC DX and this

366
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:56,805
一个是dsDX和CD我为什么需要
one is d s DX and the CD why do I need

367
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,155
知道我很抱歉我是这个
to know that I'm sorry I'm this

368
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,865
计算图已经抛出了我但是
computational graph has thrown me but

369
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,085
现在我想使用产品规则
now now I want to use the product rule

370
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,975
而且我正在使用X衍生物，所以我
and I'm taking X derivatives right so I

371
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,995
应该有计算C和s啊是的我
should have computed C and s ah yes I

372
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,855
看到我有你需要的那些
see I've got a you need those in the

373
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,135
产品规则，所以我应该计算
product rule so I should have computed

374
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:30,495
看到8+s是正确的5
see as being 8 + s as being 5 that right

375
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,515
2+311是的，我需要八个人
2 + 3 11 yeah I needed the eight in the

376
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:44,565
哦，我刚刚开始跑步了
oh what's up I've just been running

377
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,315
在这里没有让自己进入
along here without getting myself in the

378
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,585
整个图片是的8和11是对的但是
whole picture yeah 8 and 11 is right but

379
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,445
现在我正在寻找衍生品
now I'm looking for the derivatives

380
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,845
对，所以我不会增加那些
right so I don't multiply those that's

381
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,035
不是产品规则所以产品规则
not the product rule so the product rule

382
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:08,505
是什么时候这样的产品规则
is what s times so so this product rule

383
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,265
我应该做这个组合
I should I have to do this combination

384
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:20,385
这是现在的产品规则
of this is now the product rule for the

385
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:26,985
C次的衍生物，所以我想要CD
derivative of C times s so I want C D s

386
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,815
DX+sDCDX我想我现在正在进行中
DX + s DC DX I think I'm on track now

387
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,165
现在我想输入数字
and now I want to put in numbers

388
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:43,305
所以C是8，SDX我们计算了Ds
so C is 8 the SDX have we computed D s

389
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:51,015
DX是的，DX是1而现在是自己的
DX yes the s DX is 1 and now s itself is

390
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,985
计算为11和DCDX我们计算为
computed as 11 and DC DX we computed as

391
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,475
12II不敢看有我我我
12 I I don't dare look have I am I am i

392
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,475
我不认为我会得到哦不，我
I don't think I'm gonna get oh no I

393
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,245
不知道答案是什么，但对不起我
don't know what the answer yet sorry I'm

394
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,255
不要试图让你们得到88分
not trying to get 88 right you guys are

395
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,235
没有帮助你看到我遇到麻烦但是
not helping you see I'm in trouble but

396
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,175
我在这里想象的是8
what I what I imagine here is that's 8

397
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,945
那是132所以我得到了140公顷
and that's 132 so I'm getting 140 ha is

398
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,925
有可能那就是
there any possibility that that's the

399
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,765
正确答案
right answer

400
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:36,045
对于DFDX的D，这是DFDXI.
for D for D F D X this is DF DX I

401
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,775
通过观察我的斗争来计算你
computed you by watching me struggle

402
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:48,735
在这里，你看到了我每一步的想法
here you're seeing the idea I every step

403
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,545
我采取每一步的衍生物
I take the derivative of each step so it

404
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,025
是一个功率步骤X立方体所以我有一个3倍
was a power step X cube so I had a 3x

405
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,735
平方和一步，所以我有一个1
squared and a some step so I had a 1

406
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,275
然后我下一步是
then I the next step was a

407
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,705
乘法，所以我需要产品
multiplication so I needed the product

408
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,515
规则我将这些分开
rule for that I have these separate

409
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,625
数字，所以我把它们放进去，所以它是一个
numbers so I put them in and so it's a

410
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,375
我们只完成了计算图
the computational graph finished we only

411
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,325
需要两个级别，我们得到8和130
needed two levels and we got 8 and 130

412
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,185
140可以，但我们没有得到FD为什么
to 140 okay but we didn't get the FD why

413
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:35,955
是的，为此，我需要另一个需要
yes and for that I'd need another need

414
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,555
再次重做这个，我不想
to redo this again and I don't want to

415
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,675
这样做我宁愿反过来
do that I would rather do the reverse

416
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,525
模式并立即那就是做这两个动作
mode and do them both at once that's the

417
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,575
河的一点
point of the river

418
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,645
抚平的效率非常高这是很
smooth it's very efficient it's very

419
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,815
高效的实际计算
efficient actually computing the

420
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,835
完成后完成渐变
gradient after you've done the done the

421
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,475
首先为功能计算工作
work for the function computing first

422
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,635
衍生工具，你可以计算出N个第一
derivatives you could compute n first

423
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,755
约四或五的衍生物
derivatives with about like four or five

424
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,965
倍的成本不会结束倍，这是
times the cost not end times that that's

425
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,105
对我来说很神奇
amazing to me

426
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,255
这是我可以计算的惊人
that is amazing that that I can compute

427
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:22,155
梯度非常有效地通过将其通过
the gradient very efficiently by it by

428
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,285
后面的道具所以我必须这样做
the back prop so I have to you have to

429
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,425
告诉你向后的方式，但我是
show you the backwards way but so I'm

430
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,055
只是，只是我只是要跟随
just yeah just I'm just going to follow

431
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,265
所有的路径向后，以便我得到
all the paths backwards so that I get

432
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,285
DFDX和DF都是你看到的
both DF DX and D F dy just by you see

433
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,835
我的想法是采取衍生物
the idea is to take the derivative of

434
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,555
每一步都是真正的小步骤
each step each small step that's really

435
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,285
我们在微积分中做什么你知道如果你
what we do in calculus you know if you

436
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,085
想想微积分的开始
think about the start of a calculus

437
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,425
当然你的衍生品是做什么的
course what do you what derivatives do

438
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,875
我们实际上知道我们实际上是否使用XF
we actually know do we actually use X F

439
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,135
在X加DeltaX减F我们是什么
at X plus Delta X minus F do we what

440
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,435
我们研究出来的衍生品我们做了
derivatives do we grind out we do the

441
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,235
每个微积分的X到N的导数
derivatives of X to the N every calculus

442
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,545
本书以x平方和和。开头
book starts with x squared and and and

443
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,975
找到一个导数X到n然后你
finds a derivative X to the n then you

444
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:22,065
做正义X和加X然后其他人
do sine X and plus X then what others

445
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,235
还有吗
are there anymore

446
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,965
即使是对X的X好处也是如此
even e to the X good e to the X and it's

447
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,205
新生中的反函数日志
the inverse function log in freshman

448
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,165
微积分你总是写Ln只是为了
calculus you always write Ln just to be

449
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,495
过时没关系，现在可能是
out of date okay and now that may be the

450
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,395
列表是它，然后链规则在那里
list is it and then the chain rule there

451
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,455
还有其他你真正做过的事
are there others that you actually do a

452
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,375
实际上e到X的计算是
computation of actually e to the X is

453
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,135
酒店所定义的其
defined by the property that its

454
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,705
衍生物是X到X然后你
derivative is e to the X and then you

455
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,095
发现X必须是什么，正弦X
discover what log X has to be and sine X

456
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,985
你是怎么做的
you how do you do

457
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,405
X加DeltaX将比较减去
of X plus Delta X will compare minus

458
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,955
X的正弦你怎么找到你知道的
sine of X how do you find the you know

459
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,185
艰难的方式一劳永逸
the hard way once and for all way you

460
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,855
画一个小单位圆圈，然后弄乱
draw a little unit circle and and mess

461
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,545
你会发现一些角度
with some some angles and you discover

462
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,585
该正弦的衍生物是
that the derivative of the sine is the

463
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:26,174
余弦，如果你已经定义了标志
cosine that's if you've defined the sign

464
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:30,735
来自右边a的比例
from as a ratio of sides in a in a right

465
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,445
三角形，当然你可以定义它
triangle of course you could define it

466
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,605
作为一个无限的系列然后你会
as an infinite series and then you would

467
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:40,785
回到刚好那么好用的那样
be back to just using that okay so so

468
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,885
微积分正是我们正在做的事情
calculus does exactly what we're doing

469
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,174
这里通过链找到所有衍生物
here finds all derivatives by the chain

470
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:52,965
规则适用于它拥有的几个规则
rule applied to a few ones that it has

471
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,865
已经详细研究，但切线
has worked out in detail but tangent of

472
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:02,804
X我们将使用商法则割线
X we would use the quotient rule secant

473
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:05,174
我们将使用商一规则
of X we would use the quotient rule one

474
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:08,385
过余弦和我们使用的产品
over cosine and the products we use the

475
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,315
产品规则所以真正的微积分倾向于
product rule so really calculus tends to

476
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,595
你看的时候看起来相当简单
seem fairly simple after when you look

477
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,935
回来看看你到底做了什么
back to see what actually you did and

478
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,615
然后整合什么是积分
then integration what is integral

479
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,585
关于或多或少猜测的微积分
calculus about more or less guessing the

480
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,435
你必须回答你
answer right you you you have to

481
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,415
集成了XDX的f
integrate f of X DX

482
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,835
你真的和你有什么关系
and you have so really what you what you

483
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,325
要做的就是想想什么
have to do is sort of think okay what

484
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,085
有这个衍生物有什么功能
had this derivative what function had

485
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,825
那衍生物和乱七八糟的东西
that derivative and mess around and get

486
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:52,275
它真的是它呃它就是它
it so that's really it's uh it's it's a

487
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,455
新生当然我觉得还好，所以我在哪里
freshman course I guess okay so where am

488
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,155
一世
I

489
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,554
向后右，这是仍然的事情
backward right that's the thing still to

490
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,545
如何落后的系统工作
do how does the backward system work

491
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,855
好吧，我会尽力尝试
okay I'll try it try my best

492
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,815
好的，所以这里是这个大目标
okay so here's the here's the big goal

493
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:22,124
返回所以反向模式广告权利让我
back so reverse mode ad right and let me

494
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:25,844
让自己有点注意
make myself a little note a little

495
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:27,584
没注意再给你一个
little notice to give you another

496
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:32,505
您执行订单的示例
example where the order that you do the

497
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,154
计算有很大的不同我
computations makes a big difference I

498
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,225
意思是这不是很明显，这将
mean and that's not obvious that it will

499
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,505
对，数学中有很多东西
right there are many things in math that

500
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,344
你可以按任何顺序做它
you could do in either order and it it

501
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,295
从逻辑上看，你已经完成了
seems like logically you've done the

502
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,475
同样的事情，另一个和另一个
same things so another another and

503
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,575
更简单的例子，显示了一种方式
simpler example which shows how one way

504
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,825
可能比另一个快得多
could be fast away faster than another

505
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,265
方式是当我将两个矩阵相乘时
way is when I'm multiplying two matrices

506
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,015
三个矩阵，所以我乘三
three matrices so I'm multiplying three

507
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,955
矩阵B次C和C
matrices a times B times C and the

508
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,285
问题是我先做BC然后再做
question is do I do B C first and then

509
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,455
乘以a或者我先做B和
multiply by a or do I do a B first and

510
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,805
再乘上C和当然，我的
then multiply that by C and of course I

511
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,555
按照ABC的顺序保持它们的顺序
kept them in order in the order ABC but

512
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,594
计算的顺序可以是
the order of computations can be

513
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,025
不同的是你得到的相同
different then you get the same you get

514
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,635
正确回答两种方式，但那些可以
the right answer both ways but those can

515
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,854
完全不同的一个
be completely completely different one

516
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:39,405
可一千倍比快
can be a thousand times faster than the

517
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:43,545
其他所以这只是为了显示它
other so that's just to show actually it

518
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,625
有点连接到这个
kind of connects to this and there is

519
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,285
还有另外一个，所以我也会这样做
also another so I'll I'll do that too

520
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,245
而这也是这个例子
and there's also this so this is example

521
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,485
这意味着两个例子
example two where this is meant to be

522
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:04,715
示例一和示例三将是
example one and example three would be

523
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,725
它会导致称为伴随的东西
it leads to something called the adjoint

524
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,935
微分方程中的方法
method in in in differential equations

525
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,995
或者在计算中的优化
or in in optimization in in computing in

526
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,285
最大化计算最佳-是的
computing optimum in maximizing - yeah

527
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,425
并且具有相同的他们是真的
and that has the same they're really the

528
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,595
它提高速度的根本原因是
underlying reason it gives a speed up is

529
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,955
它在产品中做出了正确的选择
it makes the right choice in a product

530
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,005
三件事是的，这样就足够了
of three things yeah so it'll be enough

531
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,635
做一个例子-好吧让
to do example one an example - okay let

532
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,315
我一个小时的例子
me go with the example one hour all

533
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,205
这是现在的反向传播
right this is now back propagation

534
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,895
最后我们做到了没关系，所以我该怎么做
finally we got to it okay so how do i

535
00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:01,785
我如何嗯，我看我看我的
how do i well i look at my look at my

536
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,305
注意到我这样做是好的
notes it's how I do it okay

537
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,525
所以笔记，这是部分七点
so the notes this is section seven point

538
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,345
这两个计算图和
two does these computational graphs and

539
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:19,065
然后这里是反向模式，所以它开始
then here is reverse mode so it starts

540
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,825
在这里，我将使用
over here with so I'm going to use the

541
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,145
链规则所以DFDF是一个然后和
chain rule so DF DF is one and then and

542
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,905
然后我会倒退-而我
then I going going backwards - and I

543
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,035
必须使用当然我必须拥有
have to use of course I have to I have

544
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,485
采取我必须找到的衍生物
to take the derivatives I have to find

545
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,765
使用正确的规则所以我必须使用
use the right rule so I have to use the

546
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,315
产品规则，然后很快我将不得不
product rule and then soon I'll have to

547
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,315
使用这些权力规则和线性规则
use these power rule and linear rules so

548
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,585
当然没有改变的是
of course no change there the change is

549
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:52,905
通过倒退哦我没有
that by going backwards oh I did I don't

550
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,425
知道我是否完成了那句话
know if I completed that sentence that I

551
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,935
可以找到百分之一
could find the hundred partial

552
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,975
如果函数依赖于导数
derivatives if the function depended on

553
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,685
一百个变量大约五次
a hundred variables in about five times

554
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,295
一个变量的成本三到三
the cost of one variable three three to

555
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,145
这样的成本的五倍
five times the cost of one so so that

556
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,575
你会期待一百个
you would expect a hundred a hundred

557
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,155
连锁规则将花费一百倍
chain rules would cost a hundred times

558
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,835
但是你看到我们正在重复使用这些碎片
but but you see we're reusing the pieces

559
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,895
在链中，只是有一个更大的
in the chain and just having a larger

560
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,935
我们的连锁店更宽，但不会更长
our chain is wider but it's not longer

561
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,965
并且它不会重复，所以我在这里
and it's not repeated anyway so here I'm

562
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:40,025
将使用DFDC和DF的任何东西
gonna use whatever it is DF DC and DF

563
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:47,075
在S记住，在等什么我
the s remembering that so what in my

564
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,655
是的好，所以DFD是DC是和s
yeah okay so so DF D is DC is s and the

565
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,685
FPS是C因为因为
FPS is C that was because because

566
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,185
因为˚F开始了作为C倍的IT
because F started out as C times s it

567
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,225
是一个产品没关系
was a product okay

568
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,975
那么我们现在必须对它们进行评估
then we've got to evaluate those now

569
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,985
我再看看我是不是
I'll look again to see that I'm

570
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,755
希望写下一些
hopefully writing down some of the

571
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:17,595
正确的事情好吧现在我已经做了什么
correct things okay so now I've what

572
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,695
我接下来写的是FTC
I've written down next is the FTC is

573
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,585
关于那个例子的五个或者五个
five or no five on the on that example

574
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:34,625
这是什么FTC是C是X立方
what is it here the FTC is C is X cubed

575
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,605
所以DF哦对不起
so DF oh sorry

576
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:42,855
DFT是啊我想要我正在寻找s
DF T yeah I want s I'm looking for s

577
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:51,375
在这里，我正在寻找屁股，所以我
here yep I'm looking for ass so I'm

578
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,355
寻找s，那是X加三
looking for s and that's X plus three

579
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:04,815
为什么我这样做很好，我想要的
why am I doing this well I I want in the

580
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,635
结束以获得衍生品的尊重
end to get the derivatives with respect

581
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,325
到X和为什么整个梯度好吧我
to X and why the whole gradient okay I

582
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,845
我们认为我们是第一个正确的
think we're started right the first

583
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,525
衍生物是写CNS然后
derivatives is to write C NS and then

584
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,445
让我离开这些箱子打开刚
let me leave these boxes open just to

585
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,765
得到照片然后我会去做
get the picture then I'm going to do

586
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:39,535
然后我需要DCdXDCDYDsDX
then I'll need DC d X DC D Y D s DX

587
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:44,805
和DSD为什么我认为这是正确的
and DSD why I think that's right

588
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:49,195
写在这里我有CNS的产品
write that here I had a product of CNS

589
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,825
所以我需要在这里有两个衍生品
so I needed to had two derivatives here

590
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,865
我有CNS各自区分所以我
I have CNS each to differentiate so I

591
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,235
得到x和ay导数x
get to have an x and a y derivative x

592
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,965
和ay衍生物，现在就是它
and a y derivative and now it just it's

593
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,555
只是把它们放进去
just a matter of putting in those

594
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,745
数字和跟随链
numbers and following the chain

595
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:14,725
倒退也许我不会放
backwards maybe I'm not going to put

596
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,665
这些数字是因为我，如果我没有
those numbers in because I if I didn't

597
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,755
达到140你不会相信回来
reach 140 you wouldn't believe in back

598
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,205
传播，这就像一个
propagation and that would be like an

599
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,575
愉快的结局，所以我会离开你把
unhappy outcome so I'll leave you to put

600
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,145
他们可能或笔记有一个
them in maybe or the notes have a

601
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,145
你可以看到但你做的单独的例子
separate example that you can see but do

602
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,725
你会看到我要找的重点
you see the point that I'm going to find

603
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:44,395
所有到最后我都会找到
all the in the end I'm going to find the

604
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,475
FDX和fdy来自
F DX and the f dy from the from the

605
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,265
链从一个链而不是没有链
chain all in from one chain and not not

606
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,365
不是来自单独的链4x和a
not from a separate chain 4x and a

607
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,755
y的独立链是那个对我来说
separate chain for y that's that's to me

608
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,295
这是反向模式的重点
that's the point of reverse mode it's a

609
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,515
一点点魔力，但你看到了
little bit of magic but you see the

610
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,085
这个成分和你们中的一些人
steps the ingredient and and some of you

611
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,305
之前知道也许已经看到了这
know have seen this before and maybe

612
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,665
知道更好的阐述我发现了这个
know a better exposition I found this

613
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,385
克里斯托弗奥拉的博客清楚和这些
blog by Christopher Ola clear and these

614
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,635
你会看到非常简单的事情很清楚
very simple things you'll see are clear

615
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,555
在笔记中，但可能是另一个博客
in the notes but maybe another blog

616
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,665
使得它带来了其他的点，使
makes it brings out other points to make

617
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,575
在这里制作它可能并不明显
to make here it's not obvious maybe that

618
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,085
我可以有一百个变量和
I could have a hundred variables and and

619
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,535
并在四或五个计算
and do the calculation in four or five

620
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,575
将成本计算四到五倍
times the cost for four or five times

621
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,595
而不是一百
being instead of a hundred

622
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,515
是的，但我可以，我也可以
yeah but it's possible okay so can I

623
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:06,275
今天接近这个怎么可能
come close today with this one how could

624
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,495
那些与你不同的计算方式
those be different your computing the

625
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:14,285
相同的数字相同的AIjbjkSIque
same numbers the same AI j bj k SI que

626
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,885
eles和并做这个总和，但它是
eles and and doing this sums but it's

627
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,735
当然是不同的所以我们就这样做
certainly is different so let's just do

628
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:30,875
那好吧我会在这里做，然后在
that okay I'll do it here and then at

629
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,435
正确的时间，我猜它会
the right time and I guess it'll be

630
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,255
在Rao教授和周五之后
after professor Rao and on Friday and

631
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:39,725
星期一我会回到Fras教授那里
Monday I'll come back to professors Fras

632
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:45,745
一个收敛的简短证明
short proof of the convergence of a

633
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,695
随机梯度下降整体
stochastic gradient descent the whole

634
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,815
重点是向您展示假设的作用
point is to show you what assumptions do

635
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,915
你需要一些假设
you need you need some assumptions on

636
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,885
梯度上的一些假设
the gradient some assumptions on the

637
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,275
步长，他们是一个很好的证据
step size and they've for a good proof

638
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,395
所有的假设都融合在一起，唐
all the assumptions fit together and Don

639
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,395
得出结论和结论
outcomes the conclusion and the

640
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,225
结论会有多快
conclusion would be how fast it

641
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,735
收敛随机梯度下降所以
converges stochastic gradient descent so

642
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:15,845
有一些是预期的
there's some there's some s expected

643
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,905
因为它是随机的，我们期待的
things because it's stochastic we expect

644
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,795
关于平均值和平均值的一些假设
some assumptions about the mean and the

645
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,695
方差进入证明
variance to go into the into the proof

646
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,055
所以你会看到，但也许也是如此
so you'll see that but maybe it's too

647
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,865
今天很多，所以今天我只会
much for today so for today I'll just

648
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,425
回过头来，我甚至可以穿上它
come back to that I might even put it on

649
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:45,245
这是如此的恒星而且近在咫尺
stellar and just close with this so

650
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:53,405
假设a是M乘nB是n乘P而C是
suppose a is M by n B is n by P and C is

651
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,445
P由Q好吗
P by Q okay

652
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:02,755
找到一个步骤需要多少步骤
how many steps does it take to find a

653
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,275
倍B倍C的产物
times B times C the product of those

654
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,304
如果我这样走的话我会好三个矩阵
three matrices well if I go this way I

655
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:13,945
必须倍增我必须首先做BC
have to multiply a I have to do BC first

656
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:18,265
所以不列颠哥伦比亚省需要多少次操
so BC costs how many operations to

657
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:25,074
乘上时间是nPQ不错
multiply that times that n PQ nice

658
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,195
公式nPQ为什么我能做得好
formula n PQ why is that well I could

659
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,135
说答案是由Q和
say that the answer is is n by Q and

660
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,054
那里的每个数字都有一个内在的
every number in there was an inner

661
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:44,415
行和列的长度为P的乘积
product of a row and column of length P

662
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:50,965
所以我有NQ内部产品和每个
so I have NQ inner products and each one

663
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:59,275
成本P乘以广告然后现在
costs P multiply ads and then so now now

664
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,405
我有现在的BC，所以就是这样
I have BC which will be now so it's so

665
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,505
现在我有Mbyn然后我有Mby
now I have M by n then then I have M by

666
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:15,114
n是C乘以B的时间
n which is the a times B by C which is

667
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,485
现在我是Q，这是BC这是ABC和
now n by Q that's BC this is ABC so and

668
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,794
这个花费了M的成本
this one costs what's the cost here M by

669
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:29,935
由Q同样的规则，即将是M.
n n by Q by the same rule that'll be M

670
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:36,594
和Q好这是这是第一个方法
and Q good that's that's the first way a

671
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:41,455
现在公元前第二种方式是B次
times BC now the second way is a B times

672
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,715
C，让我再次写入N和
C and let me write in again and by N and

673
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:52,965
通过PP的Q，所以现在我先做这个
by P P by Q so now I'm doing this first

674
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:58,104
所以B费用再次告诉我现在是什么
so a B costs tell me again now what's

675
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:01,165
矩阵成本的规则
the rule for the cost of a matrix

676
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:07,235
乘以MNpm和p
multiplication MN p m and p

677
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:15,364
然后我就把M增加了
and then then I have I'm multiplying M

678
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:20,735
通过P，这是一个B乘以P的Q，那是C所以
by P that's a B times P by Q that's C so

679
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:29,075
我有MPQ所以我一起拥有它
I have M P Q so I have that together

680
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,195
与或一起与
with that or that together with that

681
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:41,614
将这两个或这两个相加
that sum those two or these two and

682
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:45,425
他们是不同的，让我们放手吧
they're different and let's just let's

683
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,225
只是认识到最重要的
just recognize the most important

684
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:50,975
例如，假设C是列向量C.
example suppose C is a column vector C

685
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,395
对于列向量，所以Q就是一个
for a column vector so Q is one there's

686
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,415
只有一列，所以如果Q是这样的话
only one column so if Q is 1 this way

687
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:06,305
NP让我们专注于这一点
did NP let's just specialize to that so

688
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:15,354
专门用于2C等于列向量
specialize to 2 C equal a column vector

689
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,535
这意味着Q是你只有
which means that Q is 1 you only have

690
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:25,685
一列，所以然后BC是对的
one column so then a times B C is versus

691
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:31,925
ABC时代所以我们就可以认识到这
a B times C so let's just figure that

692
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:37,435
当Q为1时出来，所以nPQ只是np和
out when Q is 1 so n PQ is just n p and

693
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:48,265
mNQ只是MN，其中B是M和Poh
m NQ is just MN where a B is M and P oh

694
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:53,515
那已经是一场糟糕的灾难了
that's a bad one disaster already

695
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,975
乘以这两个可能是两个
multiplying those are potentially two

696
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,364
大矩阵乘以列向量
big matrices multiplying a column vector

697
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,525
所以我在这里做了一个矩阵
so here I've done a matrix

698
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,265
乘法我从来没有做过
multiplication I never should have done

699
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,255
这是它给我的矩阵向量
that this is a matrix vector it gives me

700
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,445
一个向量，然后这是一个矩阵
a vector and then this is a matrix

701
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,495
矢量，所以我得到了很好的数字，但我
vector so I get nice numbers here but I

702
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,035
得到一个B的可怕数字然后我
get a terrible number for a B and then I

703
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,824
乘以C
multiply that by C

704
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:30,905
所以这是MPQmPQ所以MP是因子分解
so that's M PQ m P Q so MP is factoring

705
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:37,474
因为如果我把它写成n次n
out so if I if I write it as n times n

706
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:44,645
加上P对比这个是M的
plus P versus this one is M that's

707
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:52,344
分解时间M不是的
factoring out times M no yeah

708
00:49:52,349 --> 00:50:04,344
什么在这里，对不起，我在做什么
what's up here yep sorry what am i doing

709
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:05,675
是啊
yeah

710
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,754
它是P从这一个因素出来的因素
is it P that factors out from this one

711
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:18,534
好吧P次n加M对不起
okay P times n plus M sorry

712
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:31,444
无论如何，区别在于它
anyway the difference is over it again

713
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:35,185
或者是，让我再让我这样做
or or right let me let me do this again

714
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,935
如果Q是1，如果我这样走，那就是我的
if Q is 1 if I go this way was that's my

715
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,794
Q为1时的最终总数就是这个
final total when Q was 1 and that's this

716
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:48,274
知道M因子n加P
that's know M factors out times n plus P

717
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:54,514
哎呦只是这是哦不适用的因素了
whoops just this is oh no n factors out

718
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:57,474
对不起n因子n加P和
sorry n factors out times n plus P and

719
00:50:57,479 --> 00:51:06,675
所有这些都是这样的
this way was was all these things

720
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,385
M和P因素都没问题
both the M and the P factor out okay

721
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:23,185
谢谢时间加Q和Q加
thanks times and plus Q and plus Q was

722
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:30,505
一个好的，重点是我们有
one okay the whole point is we've got

723
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,995
这三个可怕的倍增
this horrible multiplication of three

724
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,245
大数字，这只有两个大
big numbers and this only had two big

725
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,675
这是他的命令
numbers so this was his orders of

726
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,255
比这更快，当然
magnitude faster than that and of course

727
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,295
你会做计算得知
you would have done the calculation that

728
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,325
你会把这个列乘以的方式
way you would have multiplied the column

729
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:51,235
通过矩阵向量来获得另一列
vector by a matrix to get another column

730
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,185
矢量，你是乘以那个
vector and you were to multiply that by

731
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,334
获取另一列向量的矩阵
a matrix to get another column vector

732
00:51:55,339 --> 00:51:59,334
在这里，你疯狂地繁殖两个大
where here you crazily multiply two big

733
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:02,485
矩阵在一起，然后得到一个列
matrices together and then got a column

734
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:05,175
矢量所以这是有有一个
vector so it was the there's there's a

735
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,295
坏动作好的，谢谢，所以我们已经过去了
bad move okay thanks so we're off past

736
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,594
这个ABC的时间只是为了显示
the time on this ABC it's just to show

737
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,344
那是一个非常熟悉的计算你
that on a very familiar calculation you

738
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:19,185
必须以正确的顺序进行
have to do it in the right order and

739
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,135
反向传播是正确的顺序
backpropagation is the right order for

740
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,344
偏导数好吧谢谢你
partial derivatives okay thank you and

741
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:30,834
所以周五携带笔记本电脑并期待
so bring laptops Friday and look forward

742
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,170
to to professor Ralph give him a good

743
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:38,480
拉尔夫教授给了他一个好的

744
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,480
欢迎
welcome
