9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,335
所以这是数学上的重要日子
so this is a big day mathematically

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,164
说话，因为我们来到这个关键
speaking because we come to this key

11
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:32,984
想法是像一点点
idea which is a little bit like

12
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:35,535
特征值很像特征值
eigenvalues well a lot like eigenvalues

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,615
但因为矩阵现在不同了
but different because the matrix a now

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,895
通常是矩形的，所以对于a
is more usually rectangular so for a

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,935
矩形矩阵的整体思想
rectangular matrix the whole idea of

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,015
特征值是因为如果我
eigenvalues is shot because if I

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,215
乘以n中的向量X的次数
multiply a times a vector X in n

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,635
后尺寸出将并购来的东西
dimensions out will come something in M

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,945
尺寸，它不会相等
dimensions and it's not going to equal

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,215
lambdaX所以ax等于lambdaX不是
lambda X so ax equal lambda X is not

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,264
甚至可能
even possible

22
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,275
如果a是矩形，即使a是
if a is rectangular and even if a is

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,735
方块有什么问题
square what are the problems just

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,245
思考一下特征值
thinking for a minute about eigenvalues

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,515
我在这里写的案例是
the the case I wrote up here is the

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,815
我有一个对称的大案例
great case where I have a symmetric

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,724
矩阵，然后它有一整套
matrix and then it's got a full set of

28
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,175
特征值和特征向量，它们是
eigenvalues and eigenvectors and they're

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,044
正交一切都好，但对于一般
orthogonal all good but for a general

30
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,495
方阵矩阵或特征向量
square matrix either the eigenvectors

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,875
复杂的特征值是复杂的还是复杂的
are complex eigenvalues are complex or

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,114
特征向量不是正交的
the eigen vectors are not orthogonal so

33
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,815
所以我们不能保持特征值
so we we can't stay with eigenvalues

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,245
永远这就是我说的和这个
forever that's what I'm saying and this

35
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,934
是这样做是正确的做法
is the right thing to do a is know so

36
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,224
这些是什么，所以这些是
what are these pieces so these are the

37
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:06,404
左，这些是正确的单数
left and these are the right singular

38
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,644
向量所以这就是新词
vectors so this is the the new word is

39
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,365
单数
singular

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,025
而在之间去的不是
and in between go the not the

41
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,465
特征值，但奇异值，所以
eigenvalues but singular values so that

42
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,685
所以我们现在已经掌握了重点
so we've gotten the whole point now you

43
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,505
得到了这有两套
got pick up on this there are two sets

44
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,645
奇异向量不是一个
of singular vectors not one for

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,035
我们只有一个设置的特征向量
eigenvectors we just had one set the

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,535
队列现在我们有矩形
queues now we have for rectangular

47
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,025
矩阵我们有一组左
matrix we've got one set of left

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,555
m维和特征中的特征向量
eigenvectors in in m dimensions and

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,535
我们有另一套权利
we've got another set of right

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,905
n维和数字的特征向量
eigenvectors in n dimensions and numbers

51
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,415
中间不是图标值而是
in between are not icon values but

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,695
奇异的价值所以这些家伙让我
singular values so these guys are let me

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,734
写下看起来像这样的东西
write what that looks like this is again

54
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,355
对角矩阵说我的两个西格玛
a diagonal matrix say my two two sigma

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,645
或者让我们说这又是一个对角线
or let's say so it's again a diagonal

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,935
中间的矩阵，但数字
matrix in the middle but the numbers on

57
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,454
对角线都是正数或0和
the diagonal are all positive or 0 and

58
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,345
它们被称为奇异值，所以它是
they're called singular values so it's

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,225
只是一个不同的世界真的很好
just a different world okay so really

60
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,225
第一步，我必须做数学题
the first step i have to do the math

61
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,255
步骤是表明任何矩阵都可以
step is to show that any matrix has can

62
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,945
被考虑到你的西格玛时代V
be factored into u times sigma times V

63
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,544
转不过就是这样这就是
transpose so that's that that's the

64
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,935
平行于光谱定理
parallel to the spectral theorem that

65
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,395
可以考虑任何对称矩阵
any symmetric matrix could be factored

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,155
那样你对那部分有好处
that way so you're good for that part

67
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,064
我们必须要做到这一点
we'll have to we just have to do it to

68
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,324
看你是什么，Sigma和V是什么
see what are you and Sigma and V what

69
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,335
是那些向量和那些单数
are those vectors and those singular

70
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,505
值得好，让我们走吧所以关键是
values okay let's go so the key is that

71
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,104
转置a是一个很好的矩阵
a transpose a is a great matrix so

72
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,685
这是这是关键的关键
that's the key that's the key to the

73
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,724
数学是一转的一所以一
math is a transpose a so one of the

74
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,435
转置的属性a
properties of a transpose a

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,725
这是一个矩形，所以也许
this is a is rectangular again so maybe

76
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,705
m-by-natranspose就是这样的
m-by-n a transpose is so this was em by

77
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,595
这是由M得到的，所以我们得到一个结果
n this was n by M so we get a result

78
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,755
这是n和你能告诉你还有什么
that's n by n and what else can you tell

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,465
关于转置这个是一件大事
me about a transpose a that's a big deal

80
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,725
这是正方形的，是的，你可以
and it's square and well yeah you can

81
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,535
现在告诉我更多因为我们谈过
tell me more now because we talked about

82
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,085
这是一个有话题的话题
something a topic that's there's a

83
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,175
它比上次对称还要多
little more than symmetric last time it

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,465
矩阵a转置a将
the matrix a transpose a will be

85
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,735
肯定的是它的特征值是
positive definite its eigenvalues are

86
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,875
大于或等于零，这将意味着
greater or equal zero and that will mean

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,795
我们可以采取他们的平方根和
that we can take their square roots and

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,915
这就是我们将要做的事情
that's what we will do so a transpose a

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,205
会有一个因子化，它是对称的
will have a factorization it's symmetric

90
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,295
它会像QlambdaQ转置一样
it'll have a like a Q lambda Q transpose

91
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,225
但我会称之为Vlambdanoyesaha
but I'm gonna call it V lambda no yeah a

92
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,715
lambda我仍称它为lambdaV.
lambda I'll still call it lambda V

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,605
颠倒
transpose

94
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,495
所以这些V是我们对此的了解
so these V's what do we know about the

95
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,235
特征向量所以这些费用或
eigenvectors so these fees or

96
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,535
这个家伙的特征向量
eigenvectors of this guy square

97
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,145
对称正定矩阵
symmetric positive-definite matrix so

98
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,965
我们处于良好的状态，我们知道什么
we're in good shape and what do we know

99
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,875
关于转置的特征值
about the eigenvalues of of a transpose

100
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,775
他们都是积极的，所以
a they are all positive so the

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,595
特征值恰好等于0和0
eigenvalues are well or equal to 0 and

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,605
这些人是正交的，这些家伙
these guys are orthogonal and these guys

103
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,414
在那里更加平等，好吧
are greater equal there and okay so

104
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,095
那是好的，这是我们的一个
that's good that's one of our that's a

105
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,935
很大程度上取决于你，但也取决于你
will depend a lot on that but also you

106
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,515
我认识到aatranspose是一个
got to recognize that a a transpose is a

107
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,795
不同的家伙aatranspose所以
different different guy a a transpose so

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,855
所以什么什么是一个一个的形状
so what what's the shape of a a

109
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,615
转换我现在有多大
transpose how big is that now I've got

110
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,375
我在哪里得到M乘以n乘以N乘以M.
where do I have M by n times n by M so

111
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,705
这将是M与M不同的大小
this will be what size M by M different

112
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,615
形状
shape

113
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,675
但具有相同的特征值相同
but with the same eigenvalues the same

114
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,414
特征值所以它会有一些
eigenvalue so it's going to have some

115
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,274
其他特征向量你当然是我
other eigenvectors you of course I'm

116
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,744
打算叫你，因为我会
going to call them you because I gonna

117
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:52,194
去那边，他们会一样的
go in over there they'll be the same

118
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,955
好吧，他们说是的，我的意思是不，我
well they're saying yeah I mean no I

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,765
不应该，我不得不说，当我说的
shouldn't I have to say when I say the

120
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,744
同样的，我不能毫不夸张意味
same I can't quite literally mean the

121
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,974
非常相同，因为这有n
very same because this has got n

122
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,494
特征值，这已经有了
eigenvalues and this has got em

123
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:14,554
特征值，但失踪的家伙
eigenvalues but the the the missing guys

124
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,985
在那些身在其中的一个不
the ones that are in one of them not on

125
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,564
另取决于大小
the other depending on the sizes are

126
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,644
零真的是事情的核心
zeros so really the heart of the thing

127
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,244
非零特征值是相同的
that nonzero eigenvalues are the same

128
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:32,524
好吧，现在我实际上已经很好了
okay now well actually I've pretty much

129
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:37,654
揭示了SVD将要使用的内容
revealed what the SVD is going to use

130
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,914
它会使用使用从这里
it's going to use the use from here and

131
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,765
在V从这儿但是这是这样的
the V's from here but that's that's the

132
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,664
故事，你必须看到这个故事好吗
story you've got to see that story okay

133
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:51,184
如此新鲜的奇异价值开始
so fresh start on the singular value

134
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,374
分解我们在寻找什么
decomposition what are we looking for

135
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,515
以及我们正在寻找的分解因素
well as a factorization so we're looking

136
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,605
对于
for

137
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:10,654
我们想要一个我们想要的矢量V这样的时候
we want a we want vectors V so that when

138
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:13,564
我乘以V，如果它是一个本征
I multiply by V so if it was an eigen

139
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:16,295
矢量它将是V等于λV
vector it would be a V equal lambda V

140
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,344
但现在它的长方形不是
but now for a it's rectangular it's not

141
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,925
你没有Argan因素所以AV是
you hasn't got Argan factors so AV is

142
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,834
西格玛新的我奇异值乘以你
Sigma the new I singular value times u

143
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,194
这是第一个人和第二个人
that's the first guy and the second guy

144
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:40,954
和ARESCAG我会在停止是
and the are scag I'll stop at are the

145
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,125
排名是的
rank yeah

146
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,975
是什么我买嘿让我
is that what I bought hey let me just

147
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,035
看到AV是西格玛，你是的，这很好
see AV is Sigma you yeah that's good

148
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,045
好的，这就是取而代之的
okay so this is what takes the place of

149
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,385
斧等于拉姆达XA的一组次
ax equal lambda X a times one set of

150
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,425
奇异向量给了我很多次
singular vectors gives me a number times

151
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,315
另一组奇异向量和
the other set of singular vectors and

152
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,125
我为什么停下来是因为
why did I stop at are the rank because

153
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,274
在此之后，适马是0，所以后
after that the Sigma's are 0 so after

154
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,815
我可以有更多的家伙但是
that I could have some more guys but

155
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,095
它们将在零空间0中
they'll be in the null space 0 on down

156
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,565
VN所以这些是重要的
to of VN so these are the important ones

157
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,595
这就是我在寻找的东西
so that's what I'm looking for

158
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,685
我可以卖掉让我现在用语言说出来
can I sell let me say it now in words

159
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,365
我正在寻找一堆正交
I'm looking for a bunch of orthogonal

160
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,074
向量V，以便当我乘以它们时
vectors V so that when I multiply them

161
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,375
通过我得到一堆正交向量
by a I get a bunch of orthogonal vectors

162
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,834
你不是那么清楚，但它
u that is not so clearly possible but it

163
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,225
它有可能它确实发生我
it it is possible it does happen I'm

164
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,084
寻找一组正交
looking for one set of orthogonal

165
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:01,875
矢量V在输入空间中你可以
vectors V in the input space you could

166
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,995
这样说就是输出中的一个V'
say so that the a V's in the output

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,584
在我们的图片中，空间也正交
space are also orthogonal in our picture

168
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,005
你知道我们的图片
of you know our picture of the

169
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,435
基本的大局
fundamental the the big picture of

170
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,454
线性代数我们在这里有这些
linear algebra we have these in this

171
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,905
空格，然后在零空间中的东西
space and then stuff in the null space

172
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,444
我们在这里有看法
and we have views over here in the

173
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,435
列空间和null中的一些东西
column space and some stuff in the null

174
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,225
在那边的空间，我的想法是
space over there and the idea is that I

175
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,035
这里有正交的V和我
have orthogonal V's here and when I

176
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,394
乘以a乘以a然后我
multiply by a so multiplied by a then I

177
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,565
在这里正交使用正交
get orthogonal use over here orthogonal

178
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,324
正交就是这就是什么
to orthogonal that's what that's what

179
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,084
使V和他们使用
makes the V's and they use

180
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,324
特别的权利没关系就是那个
special right okay that's that's the

181
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,605
财产，然后当我们写下来
property and then when we write down

182
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,105
好吧，让我写下那会是什么
well let me write down what that would

183
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,584
这意味着我刚画了一张照片
mean what so I've just drawn a picture

184
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,994
顺其那些方程式
to go with this those equations that

185
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,675
图片与这些方程式一致
picture just goes with these equations

186
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,134
让我写下它意味着什么
and let me just write down what it means

187
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:23,264
它意味着矩阵所以我写了哦
it means in matrix so I've written it oh

188
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,254
是的我在这里用矢量一写了
yeah I've written it here in vectors one

189
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,865
在一个时间，但当然你知道我
at a time but of course you know I'm

190
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,965
将这些矢量放入列中
gonna put those vectors into the columns

191
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,304
一个矩阵，所以v1倍于let的
of a matrix so a times v1 up to let's

192
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:45,975
说VR会等于哦是的等于
say V R will equal oh yeah it equals

193
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,615
西格玛时代使用所以这就是我的意思
Sigma times use so this is what I'm

194
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,905
之后是u1直到你乘以
after is u1 up to you are multiplied by

195
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:02,074
西格玛一个属于西格玛，我是什么
Sigma one belong to Sigma ha what I'm

196
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,134
现在做的只是说我正在转变
doing now is just to say I'm converting

197
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:12,105
这些单独的奇异向量各V
these individual singular vectors each V

198
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,774
进入au把它们全部放进去
going into au to putting them all

199
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,754
当然，我们一起进入矩阵
together into a matrix and of course

200
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:20,115
我在这里写的是V等于你
what I've written here is a V equals u

201
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,514
SigmaaV等于uSigma就是这样
Sigma a V equals u Sigma that's what

202
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:36,405
这相当于我要放
that amounts to well then I'm gonna put

203
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,194
一个V转置在这一边，我会
a V transpose on this side and I'm gonna

204
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,985
得到一个等于你的西格玛V转置
get to a equals u Sigma V transpose

205
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,274
将两边乘以V
multiplying both sides there by V

206
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,785
转置你我有点写同样的东西
transpose u I'm kind of writing the same

207
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,165
不同形式矩阵形式的东西
thing in different forms matrix form

208
00:12:53,170 --> 00:13:00,434
矢量在时间形式，现在我们必须
vector at a time form and now we have to

209
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,754
现在找到他们我已经用完了
find them now now I've used up boards

210
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,764
说出我们所追求的，但现在我们得到了
saying what we're after but now we got

211
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,644
到达那里什么是V和
to get there so what are the V's and

212
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,945
有什么用？
what are the use

213
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,675
好的想法是想到一个
well the cool idea is to think of a

214
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,095
转移一个所以你和我在一起我们是什么
transpose a so you're with me what we're

215
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,235
对于现在想想转置一个这样
for and now think about a transpose a so

216
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,965
我，如果这是我希望的
I if this is what I'm hoping for

217
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:36,065
什么会转一个练得
what will a transpose a turn out to be

218
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,735
如此重要的时刻即将揭示
so big moment that's going to reveal

219
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,825
如果我形成一个，那么v是什么
what the v's are so if I form a

220
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,805
转置一个这样的转置，所以我有一个
transpose a so a transpose so I've got a

221
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,205
转移这个家伙所以转置是V
transpose this guy so a transpose is V

222
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,865
Sigma转换你的转置权利和
Sigma transpose u transpose right and

223
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:03,195
然后是一个这是你的西格玛V
then comes a which is this u Sigma V

224
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,205
转置，为什么我这样做
transpose so why did I do that

225
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,774
为什么转置a很酷
why is it that a transpose a is the cool

226
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,725
要看问题来解决问题
thing to look at to make the problem

227
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,365
什么使得变成什么更简单
simpler well what what make what becomes

228
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,505
在那条线上写的比较简单
simpler in that line just written u

229
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,575
转置你是我的身份因为我
transpose u is the identity because I'm

230
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,435
实际上寻找正交
looking for orthogonal in fact

231
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,675
正交使用，这是身份
orthonormal use so that's the identity

232
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:37,305
所以这是VSigma转换SigmaV
so this is V Sigma transpose Sigma V

233
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,385
转置将流程围绕在那里
transpose put processes around that

234
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:47,915
因为这是一个对角矩阵没关系
because that's a diagonal matrix okay

235
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,445
那是什么告诉我这是什么呢
what does that tell me what does that

236
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,155
告诉我们所有人一个转置a有这个
tell all of us a transpose a has this

237
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,524
窗体现在我们已经看到了我们之前的形式
form now we've seen that form before we

238
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,915
知道这是一个对称矩阵
know that this is a symmetric matrix

239
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,195
对称甚至是正定的
symmetric and even positive definite so

240
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,075
什么是V的V是本征
what are the V's the V's are the eigen

241
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,995
转置的向量在这里
vectors of a transpose a here where this

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,395
这是QlambdaQ的转置
is the Q lambda Q transpose for that

243
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,245
对称矩阵所以我们知道v是
symmetric matrix so we know the v's are

244
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,785
特征向量
the eigenvectors the

245
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:32,075
转置a和I的特征向量
the eigen vectors of a transpose a and I

246
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,745
我猜我们也会去那里
guess we're also going to get there the

247
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,415
奇异值使Sigma转换
singular value so the Sigma transpose

248
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,775
Sigma将成为SigmaSquared的
Sigma which will be the Sigma Squared's

249
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:50,605
是转置的特征值a
are the eigenvalues of a transpose a

250
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,735
好样的通过寻找正确的
good sort of by looking for the correct

251
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,165
事情你西格玛V转置然后
thing you Sigma V transpose and then

252
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,075
只是使用你转移你的邪恶
just using the u transpose u evil

253
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,625
身份我们把它回到我们的东西
identity we cut it back to something we

254
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,915
我们完全认识到一个转置
we perfectly recognize a transpose a has

255
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,625
那形成所以现在我们知道V是什么
that form so now we know what the V's

256
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,305
是，如果我做的其他方式，其
are and if I do it the other way which

257
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,545
有什么其他的方式，而不是
what's the other way instead of a

258
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:24,065
转移另一种方式是，如果我
transpose a the other way is and if I

259
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,505
写下所有那些是你的西格玛
write all that down the a is the u Sigma

260
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,135
V转置和转置是V
V transpose and the a transpose is the V

261
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,675
Sigma转换你的转置和再次
Sigma transpose u transpose and again

262
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,185
这东西消失了，离开了我
this stuff goes away and leaves me with

263
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,675
你SigmaSigmaSigma转换你
you Sigma Sigma Sigma transpose u

264
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,165
转置所以我知道要使用的是-
transpose so I know what to use are -

265
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:59,485
它们是转移的特征向量
they're the eigenvectors of a a transfer

266
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,995
你不是那种美丽的对称
isn't that a beautiful symmetry you just

267
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,025
a转置a和aa转置他们是
a transpose a and a a transpose they're

268
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,395
两个不同的家伙现在所以他们各自
two different guys now so they have each

269
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,175
有自己的特征向量，我们都使用它们
has its own eigenvectors and we use both

270
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,405
它是正确的，我只需要采取
it's just right and i just have to take

271
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,944
最后一步，我们已经确立了
the final step and and we've established

272
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,265
SVD所以最后一步是要记住
the SVD so the final step is to remember

273
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,055
我要去的地方有一次V是
what I'm going for here a times a V is

274
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,065
应该是西格玛时代的你
supposed to be Sigma times a you

275
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,325
看看我有什么需要处理的
see what I'm what I have to deal with

276
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,764
现在我还没有完成它
now is I haven't quite finished it's

277
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,924
尽管如此，它还是完美无缺的
it's just perfect as far as it goes but

278
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,634
它还没有走到尽头，因为我们
it hasn't gone to the end yet because we

279
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:50,914
可以有双特征值和三倍
could have double eigenvalues and triple

280
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,494
特征值和所有那些可怕的
eigenvalues and all those horrible

281
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:57,414
可能性，如果我有三倍
possibilities and if i have triple

282
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,554
然后是特征值或双特征值
eigenvalues or double eigenvalues then

283
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,264
如果我有什么特征向量的交易
what's the deal with eigenvectors if i

284
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,754
具有双特征值假设矩阵
have double eigenvalue suppose a matrix

285
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:10,774
有一种类型说对称矩阵有一个
has a type say a symmetric matrix has a

286
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,955
双特征值让我只需要一个
double eigenvalue let me just take an

287
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,725
例如对称矩阵如111
example so symmetric matrix like say 1 1

288
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,424
5让它为什么不能有什么处理
5 make it why not what's the deal with

289
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:30,004
该矩阵的特征向量115所以5
eigenvectors for that matrix 1 1 5 so 5

290
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,435
有一个特征向量你可以看到什么
has got an eigenvector you can see what

291
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,024
它是00有关的特征向量1什么
it is 0 0 1 what about the eigenvectors

292
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,754
为此，lambda等于1
that go with lambda equal 1 for that

293
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,705
矩阵怎么了我将会是什么
matrix what's up what I what would be

294
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,445
lambda的特征向量等于1
eigenvectors for lambda equal 1

295
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,614
不幸的是，有一整个平面
unfortunately there's a whole plane of

296
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:55,014
他们任何形式的矢量
them any vector of the full of the form

297
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,075
XY0XY平面中的任何任何矢量
XY 0 any any any vector in the XY plane

298
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,565
会产生XY0
would produce XY 0

299
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,634
特征向量的旅行平面，我
travel plane of eigenvectors and i've

300
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:10,114
有一个选择两个是正交的这
got a pick two that are orthogonal which

301
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,205
我能做到，然后他们必须在
i can do and then they have to be in the

302
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,695
在SVD中是两个正交的人
in the SVD that was two orthogonal guys

303
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,335
一定要到两个正交的家伙
have to go to two orthogonal guys in

304
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,784
换句话说有点像
other words is a little bit of like

305
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:26,274
细节在这里很少进入这个
detail here little getting into this

306
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:34,835
究竟什么才能让我放过
exactly what is well actually let me let

307
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,465
我告诉你步骤好，所以我用它
me tell you the steps ok so I use this

308
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,804
得出结论认为v是
to conclude that that the v's the

309
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,174
奇异向量应该被电离I
singular vector should be ionized I

310
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:48,725
结束了这一步的人
concluded those guys from this step

311
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,455
现在我不会那么多地使用这一步
now I'm not gonna use this step so much

312
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,825
当然，这是我的想法
of course it's in the back of my mind

313
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,695
但是我没有使用它我会得到它
but I'm not using it I I'm gonna get the

314
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:07,025
从这里使用，所以你是一个V1结束
use from here so you one is a V 1 over

315
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:15,995
西格玛1就是西格玛的VR
Sigma 1 the you are is a V R over Sigma

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,165
R请勿你看到我在这里做
R do you see what I'm doing here

317
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:25,715
我正在挑选一架可能的飞机
I'm picking in a possible plane of

318
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,585
我希望他们使用的东西我想要的
things the one I want they use I want so

319
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,195
我选择了V，我选择了
I've chosen the V's I've chosen the

320
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,395
西格玛，他们是固定的
Sigma's they were they're fixed for a

321
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,905
转置特征向量RV的
transpose a the eigenvectors RV's the

322
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,575
这个特征值是西格玛
things this eigen values are Sigma

323
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,505
平方的还好，现在则是这样的
Squared's okay and now then this is the

324
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,815
UI想要你和我在一起，所以我不得不这样做
U I want are you with me so I had to I

325
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,535
不得不给我想要得到这些用途
had to give I want to get these use

326
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,265
正确的，如果我有一个完整的飞机
correct and if I have a whole plane of

327
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,825
我必须选择正确的可能性
possibilities I got to pick the right

328
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,365
一个好的，现在我终于要表现出来了
one okay and now finally I have to show

329
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,365
这是正确的，所以还剩下什么
that it's the right one so what is left

330
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,135
表明我会证明这些用途是
to show I would show that these use are

331
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,525
转置的特征向量和i
eigenvectors of a a transpose and i

332
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,195
应该表明它们是正交的
should show that they're orthogonal

333
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,465
对，这是关键的权利ii会
right that's the key right i i would

334
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,365
喜欢表明这些是正交的
like to show that these are orthogonal

335
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,545
那就是这张照片中的内容
then that's what goes in this picture

336
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,825
v我是正统的伙伴因为
the v's I've got orthogonal guys because

337
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,805
我他们是他们的特征向量
I they're they're the eigenvectors of a

338
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,145
对称矩阵选择更彻底
symmetric matrix pick a more thorough

339
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,415
但是现在我正在增加一个，所以我
but now I'm multiplying by a so I'm

340
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,805
得到U的AV是超过Sigma的
getting the U which is AV over Sigma for

341
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,135
基础向量和我必须表明
the basis vectors and I have to show

342
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,335
他们是正交的
they're orthogonal

343
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,715
所以这就像最后一刻一样
so this is like the final moment does

344
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,145
如果我，一切都在一起
everything come together right if I

345
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,175
选择V作为a的特征向量
picked the V's as the eigen vectors of a

346
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,605
颠倒
transpose

347
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,265
然后我把这些用于使用
and then I take these for the use are

348
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,775
他们正交，所以我想
they orthogonal so I would like to think

349
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,655
我们可以检查那个事实
that we can check that fact and it that

350
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,905
它会好的，你可以吗？
it will come out okay could you just

351
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,145
通过这个帮助我，我永远不会问
help me through this one I'll never ask

352
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,355
只是为了得到任何东西
for anything again just just just get

353
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:32,794
SVD还好，所以我想展示一下
the SVD for okay so I would like to show

354
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,825
那个让你放弃的那个
that a that you one that's so let me put

355
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,075
我正在做的事情我想表现出来
up what I'm doing I'm trying to show

356
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,705
u1转置u2为零
that u 1 transpose u 2 is zero

357
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:54,715
有可溶性好，所以你1是V1
there are soluble okay so u 1 is a V 1

358
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,965
超过西格玛1
over Sigma 1

359
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,885
那是你的转换你和你是一个
that's transpose that's u 1 and u 2 is a

360
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,075
在Sigma2V2，我希望得到0
V 2 over Sigma 2 and I want to get 0 the

361
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,885
整个谈话已经结束了
whole conversation has ended right is

362
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,255
在这里结束为什么这个改变0
ending right here why is that change 0

363
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,875
V是正交的
the V's are orthogonal

364
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,145
我们知道签证正交有
we know the visa orthogonal there are

365
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,125
saga正常的转置特征向量
saga normal eigen vectors of a transpose

366
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,595
a要重复V是的
a to be repeat that the V's are

367
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,304
转置的正交特征向量
orthogonal eigen vectors of a transpose

368
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:39,005
我知道他们在那里我们
a which I know they're there there we

369
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,975
可以找到他们然后我选择使用
can find them then I chose the use to be

370
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,914
这个，我想得到的答案是0
this and I want to get the answer 0 are

371
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:50,065
你准备好做它，我们希望我们要
you ready to do it we want to we want to

372
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,195
计算并得到0所以我得到了什么
compute that and get 0 so what do I get

373
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,595
我们只需要这样做就可以看到了
let's we just have to do it so I can see

374
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,885
分母就是那样的V.
that the denominator is that so is it V

375
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:13,955
1转置右转AV2
1 transpose a transpose right times AV 2

376
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,615
我希望得到零，我得零
and I'm hoping to get zero do I get zero

377
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,525
这里
here

378
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,155
你希望所以是的v1是正交v2但是
you hope so yeah v1 is orthogonal v2 but

379
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,525
我有一个插入棍子的转置
I've got a transpose a stick stuck in

380
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,615
中间那里我该怎么做
the middle there so what do I what

381
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:38,685
发生在这里我怎么看待v2是
happens here how do I look at that v2 is

382
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:45,165
转置的特征向量是一个了不起的
an eigenvector of a transpose a terrific

383
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:51,365
所以这是V1转置，这是
so so this is V 1 transpose and this is

384
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,415
矩阵乘以V2，使得Sigma2
the matrix times V 2 so that's Sigma 2

385
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,465
转置V2不是它
transpose V 2 isn't it

386
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,975
它是具有特征值的特征向量
it's the eigenvector with eigenvalue

387
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,925
Sigma2平方乘以V2yep除以
Sigma 2 squared times V 2 yep divided by

388
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:17,325
西格玛1西格玛2所以A的出局
Sigma 1 Sigma 2 so the A's are out of

389
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,065
我现在就这样做，所以我只是削减
there now and do I so I've just cuts

390
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,485
这些数字西格玛2平方所以
these numbers Sigma 2 squared so that

391
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,965
我会是Sigma2而不是Sigma1
would be Sigma 2 over Sigma 1 is I've

392
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,295
这里的数字占这些数字的时间
accounted for these numbers here times V

393
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:40,965
1转V2，现在什么事有
1 transpose V 2 and now what's up there

394
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:46,215
正交我们得到它的0是0
orthonormal we got it that's 0 that is 0

395
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,285
是的，所以不仅是V的
there yeah so so not only are the V's

396
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,285
彼此正交，但因为
orthogonal to each other but because

397
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,775
他们是转换的RIghen向量a
they're RI ghen vectors of a transpose a

398
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,015
当我这样做时，我发现了一个V的
when I do this I discover that the a V's

399
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,925
超过在相互正交
are orthogonal to each other over in the

400
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,815
在列空间中正交Vin
in the column space so orthogonal V's in

401
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,325
行空间正交AVsover
the row space orthogonal AV s over in

402
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,275
发现的列空间
the column space that was discovered

403
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,635
在特征向量和特征向量之后很久很久
late much long after eigenvectors and

404
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,055
这是一段有趣的历史
it's a interesting history

405
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,375
它只是出来然后它
and it just comes out right and then it

406
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,225
被发现，但没有太多用于哦
was discovered but not much used for Oh

407
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,025
可能是一百年
a hundred years probably

408
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:37,965
然后人们看到它确切地说
and then people saw that it was exactly

409
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,455
正确的事情，数据矩阵成为
the right thing and data matrices became

410
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,625
重要的是大矩形
important which are large rectangular

411
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,245
矩阵，我们没有哦，我更好地说
matrices and we have not oh I better say

412
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,975
实际上，这里只是一个词
a word just a word here about actually

413
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,025
计算v和Sigma和
computing the v's and the Sigma's and

414
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,225
他们如此使用你会如何找到
they use so how would you actually find

415
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,915
他们，你最想说的就是你
them you what I most want to say is you

416
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:14,295
不会为了这个转置根本为什么
would not go this a transpose a root why

417
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,415
为什么这是一个大错误
why is it like it is that a big mistake

418
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,435
如果你有一个矩阵说五千
if you have a matrix a say five thousand

419
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,775
一万个为什么是错误的
by ten thousand why is it a mistake to

420
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,965
实际上使用转置a
actually use a transpose a in the

421
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,915
计算我们用它很大
computation we used it big

422
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,175
大量的证据，我们可以找到
heavily in the proof and we could find

423
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,155
另一个不会使用它的证据
another proof that wouldn't use it so

424
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,215
很多，但为什么我不会为什么这样做
much but why would I not do why would I

425
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,375
不乘这两个在一起很
not multiply these two together it's

426
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,355
非常昂贵它增加了一个
very big very expensive it adds in a

427
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,505
你有一个矩阵
whole lot of roundoff you have a matrix

428
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,745
那是现在它的脆弱性
that's now it's vulnerability to

429
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,985
舍入误差是被调用的平方
roundoff errors is squared that's called

430
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,295
它的条件数得到平方
its condition number gets squared and

431
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,665
你只是不去那里实际
you just don't go there so the actual

432
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,715
计算方法相当
computational methods are quite

433
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,925
不同，我们会谈论那些但是
different and we'll talk about those but

434
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,525
a转置a因为它是
the the a transpose a because it's

435
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,855
对称正定的
symmetric positive-definite made the

436
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,495
证明很好，这就是你的意思
proof so nice that's that's what you've

437
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,615
看到最好的证据，我会说和
seen the nicest proof I'd say of the and

438
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,405
现在我应该考虑几何学
now I should think about the geometry so

439
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,115
什么是平等的
so what does a equal

440
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,985
一个你的sigmat也许我拿另一个
a well you sigmat maybe I take another

441
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,654
董事会，但它会填补它，但它是
board but it's it will fill it but it's

442
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:52,105
就像当你唱我的V置我这样
like when you sing my V transpose I so

443
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,945
它有三个因素，我愿意
it's got three factors there and I would

444
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,044
就像那时每个因素都是一种
like then each factor is kind of a

445
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,794
特殊矩阵U和V是正交的
special matrix U and V are orthogonal

446
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,544
矩阵所以我认为那些是旋转
matrix so I think of those as rotations

447
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,975
Sigma是我想到的对角矩阵
Sigma is a diagonal matrix I think of it

448
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,955
因为现在我正在努力
as stretching so now I'm just going to

449
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,835
绘制图片所以这里是单位向量
draw the picture so here's unit vectors

450
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,784
如果我是第一件事就是这样的话
and the first thing so this if I'm

451
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,274
乘以X这是第一件事
multiplied by X this is the first thing

452
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,904
这发生在这里旋转
that happens so that rotates here's

453
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:31,044
这是Xs然后VtransposeX就是这样
here's X s then V transpose X is that

454
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:35,245
那仍然是一个圆圈长度没有
that's still a circle length didn't

455
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,065
当我乘以一个时，改变那些
change for those when I multiply by an

456
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,245
正交矩阵，但矢量转向
orthogonal matrix but the vectors turned

457
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,855
轮换可能是一种反思
it's a rotation could be a reflection

458
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,034
但是让我们把它保持为现在轮换的东西
but let's keep it as a rotation now what

459
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,894
西格玛是否这样做我有这个单位圈
does Sigma do so I have this unit circle

460
00:29:54,899 --> 00:30:00,325
这些我在2d所以我画了一张照片
these I'm in 2d so I'm drawing a picture

461
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,315
这些是向量的单位
of the vectors these are the unit

462
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,554
在2dXY的矢量他们被转向了
vectors in 2d X Y they got turned by the

463
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,875
正交矩阵
orthogonal matrix

464
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,215
西格玛对这张照片做了什么
what does Sigma do to that picture

465
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,034
它延伸，因为西格玛倍增
it stretches because Sigma multiplies by

466
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,005
Sigma1在第一组分Sigma2中
Sigma 1 in the first component Sigma 2

467
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,435
在第二个，所以它延伸这些家伙
in the second so it stretches these guys

468
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,375
并说让我们假设这是一个数
and say let's suppose this is number one

469
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,385
这是第二个数字
and this is number two this is number

470
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,794
一，这是第二
one and this is number two

471
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,054
所以Sigma我们的惯例是Sigmaone
so Sigma one our convention is Sigma one

472
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,695
我们总是把Sigma1等于更大
we always take Sigma 1 greater equals

473
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,304
西格玛2更大等于更大
Sigma 2 greater equal whatever greater

474
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:45,054
同等的西格玛排名和那个和那个
equal Sigma rank and that's and that

475
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,524
他们都很积极
they're all positive

476
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:52,514
其余的都是零，所以Sigma会的
and the rest are zero so Sigma one will

477
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,134
比西格玛二大，所以我
be bigger than Sigma two so I'm

478
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:56,804
期待这个椭圆它会改变
expecting this ellipse it'll change

479
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:58,994
圈定为椭圆，当你
circle goes to an ellipse when you

480
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:03,644
舒展我没有得到它相当
stretch the I didn't get it quite

481
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:08,384
完美但不坏，所以这就是这个
perfect but not bad so this was this

482
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:14,234
将是Sigma2V2VSigma1V1和
would be Sigma 2 V 2 V Sigma 1 V 1 and

483
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:18,345
这将是Sigma2V2，我们现在
this would be Sigma 2 V 2 and we now

484
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,565
有一个椭圆，所以我们从X开始
have an ellipse so we started with X's

485
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,524
在一个圆圈中，我们旋转，我们伸展和
in a circle we rotated we stretched and

486
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:31,335
现在最后一步是采取这些家伙
now the final step is take these guys

487
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,484
并将它们乘以你所以这就是
and multiply them by you so this was the

488
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:38,835
SigmaV转换X，现在我已经准备好了
Sigma V transpose X and now I'm ready

489
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,374
因为最后来的U部分
for the U part which comes last because

490
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:45,164
它在左边，发生了什么
it's at the left and what happens from

491
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:50,955
现在是什么画面你做了什么
what's the picture now what does you do

492
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,685
椭圆旋转它
to the ellipse it rotates it

493
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,924
它的另一个正交矩阵它
it's another orthogonal matrix it

494
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:05,195
将它旋转到可能存在的地方
rotates it somewhere maybe there and now

495
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:14,595
我们看到使用u2和u1做啊也许
we see the use u2 and u1 do ah maybe

496
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,644
也许他们在那里也许我让我放过
maybe they're there maybe I let me let

497
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:25,154
我认为基本上不是这样
me think about that basically that's not

498
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,784
那就对了
that's right

499
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:31,455
所以这个SVD告诉我们一些事情
so so this SVD is telling us something

500
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,674
每个线性都非常引人注目
quite remarkable that every linear

501
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,965
转换每个矩阵
transformation every matrix

502
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,674
乘法因子变为旋转
multiplication factors into a rotation

503
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,774
拉伸时间不同的时间
times a stretch times a different

504
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:50,715
旋转，但实际上可能不同
rotation but possibly different actually

505
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,374
你什么时候和V一样
when would the u be the same as the V

506
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:57,554
这是一个很好的问题，什么时候是你的
here's a good question when is U the

507
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,225
当两个单数时，与V相同
same as V when are the two singular

508
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,125
向量只是
vectors just

509
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,544
同样的，因为必须是
the same because a would have to be

510
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:09,135
广场，我们希望这是相同的
square and we want this to be the same

511
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,804
如果他们是QlambdaQ转置
as Q lambda Q transpose if they're the

512
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:17,475
同样如此使用将是相同的
same so the use would be the same as the

513
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,914
当矩阵是对称的时，V是
V's when the matrix is symmetric and

514
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,455
实际上我们需要它是积极的
actually we need it to be positive

515
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,485
明确的原因是因为我们的
definite why is that because our

516
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,005
惯例是这些家伙更大
convention is these guys are greater

517
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,585
如果这样的话，这些家伙就等于零
equal zero these guys if it's going to

518
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,485
是一样的然后是积极的
be the same then so for a positive

519
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:45,075
确定对称矩阵的S
definite symmetric matrix the the S the

520
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,145
我们开始的S与之相同
S that we started with is the same as

521
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,475
你是下一行的a耶
the you as the a on the next line yeah

522
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,225
Q是U的Q转置为V
the Q is the U the Q transpose as the V

523
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,885
转置lambda是Sigma所以
transpose the lambda is the Sigma so

524
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,804
那些是好的矩阵，它们是
those are the good matrices and they're

525
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:01,635
那些你无法改进的
the ones that you can't improve

526
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,065
基本上他们真好，你能
basically they're so good you can you

527
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,985
不能使正定对称
can't make a positive definite symmetric

528
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,544
矩阵比它更好
matrix better than it is

529
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,634
好吧也许对角化它或什么的
well maybe diagonalize it or something

530
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,124
但好吧，现在我想起了一个
but okay now I think of like one

531
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:20,535
在这里提问，它有助于帮助我
question here that it helps to helps me

532
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:27,015
无论如何要保持这个数字如何
anyway to keep this figure straight how

533
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:35,614
我想计算一下这里的参数
I want to count the parameters in this

534
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,825
因素分解，所以我是两个两个
factorization so I'm two by two

535
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:46,955
我是两个两个，所以一个有四个数字
I'm two by two so a has four numbers

536
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,644
ABCD然后我想我觉得那四个
ABCD then I guess I feel that four

537
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:57,405
数字应出现在右侧
numbers should appear on the right-hand

538
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,665
侧以某种方式在U和西格玛和
side somehow the U and the Sigma and the

539
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,325
V转置应该总共消耗掉
V transpose should use up a total of

540
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,175
四个数字所以我们有一个美丽的小镇
four numbers so we have a beautiful town

541
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,905
婷左边那间匹配
ting match between the left side that's

542
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,575
有四个数字abcd和右边
got four numbers a b c d and the right

543
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,735
这方面有
side that's got

544
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,545
数字埋在那里的某个地方
number is buried in there somewhere so

545
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,415
我们可以把它们挖出来吗？
can we dig them out how many numbers in

546
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:29,825
西格玛对Sigma1和Sigma非常清楚
Sigma that's pretty clear to Sigma 1 and

547
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:35,045
Sigma2的两个特征值有多少
Sigma 2 the two eigenvalues how many

548
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:41,075
这个轮换中的数字，所以如果我有一个
numbers in this rotation so I if I had a

549
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,505
不同颜色的粉笔我会放两个
different color chalk I would put two

550
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,955
因为我数了四件事
for the number of things I counted four

551
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,465
通过Sigma有两个参数
by Sigma how many parameters does a two

552
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,605
通过两次旋转需要1和什么是a
by two rotation require 1 and what's a

553
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,665
什么是那个或那个好词
what's a good word for that one or that

554
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,025
一个参数就像我有Rcos
one parameter it's like I have R cos

555
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,515
thetasinetheta减去sinethetacos
theta sine theta minus sine theta cos

556
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,805
theta有一个数字
theta there's a number

557
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:12,305
fada它是旋转的角度
fada it's it's the angle that rotates so

558
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,965
这是一个告诉轮换的人
that's one guy to tell the rotation

559
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,535
角度两个家伙告诉弹力
angle two guys to tell the stretchings

560
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,925
还有一个告诉轮换
and one more to tell the rotation from

561
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,495
你将最多四个这样所以那些
you adding up to four so so those

562
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,315
那些与四个匹配的帐户
account those match up with the four

563
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,985
号码我们开始的ABCD
numbers ABCD that we start with of

564
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,255
当然这是一个复杂的关系
course it's a complicated relation

565
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,645
在这四个数字和之间
between those four numbers and and

566
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,745
旋转和伸展，但它是
rotations and stretches but but it's

567
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:49,685
无论如何四等于四，我想如果
four equals four anyway and I guess if

568
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,345
你做了三个三个人，三个人
you did three by threes oh three by

569
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,005
三分之后会发生什么事情
threes what would happened then so let

570
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,535
我带三个你想要照顾
me take three do you want to care for

571
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,925
三个三分之一就是这样
three by threes just it's sort of

572
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,835
满足获得四个相等的4个，也
satisfying to get four equal four but

573
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,895
现在我们得到了三到三个
now what do we get three by three we got

574
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:17,435
这里有九个你好这么多数字
how many numbers here nine hello so

575
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,825
这九个数字在哪里如何
where are those nine numbers well how

576
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,195
这里很多人通常都很容易
many here that's usually the easy three

577
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,035
那么你的客人有多少人
so what's your guests for the how many

578
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,544
你需要旋转三维旋转
and a rotation in a 3d rotation you take

579
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:39,475
一个球体，你旋转它多少
a sphere and you rotate it how many how

580
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,655
许多数字告诉你什么是什么
many numbers to tell you what's what to

581
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,175
告诉你你做了什么，我们希望
tell you what you did three we hope

582
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,604
三，是的，它将是三三和
three yeah it's gonna be three three and

583
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:51,344
三为...为
three for the for the for the

584
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,245
我们生活的三维世界
three-dimensional world that we live in

585
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,195
所以以旋转为生的人
so people who do rotations for a living

586
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,675
明白在3d中旋转但如何
understand that a rotation in 3d but how

587
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,755
你看到了吗我的意思是三个字
do you see this I mean it's three words

588
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,175
我们做对了没关系，是的滚动
and we've got it right okay yeah roll

589
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,074
俯卧和偏航是的，我猜飞行员
pitch and yaw yeah I guess about pilot

590
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:19,165
希望知道那三个是啊
hopefully knows about those three yeah

591
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,735
是的，是的，当这些是滚动时
yeah yeah which is roll when these are

592
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:44,695
喜欢向前和向后哦哦，你在一个
like forward and back oh yo you're in a

593
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,515
你呆在飞机上，没关系
you stay in a plane and you okay

594
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,725
美丽的右边，这导致我们
beautiful right right and that leads us

595
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:54,535
以我们的四个四个维度什么是你的
to our four four dimensions what's your

596
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,215
在4d猜测
guess on 4d

597
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,854
好吧，我们可以再次计算
well let's we could do the count again

598
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,775
如果它是四乘四我们会有
if it was four by four we would have

599
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,385
十六个数字在那里和中间
sixteen numbers there and in the middle

600
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,185
我们总是有一个轻松的时间
we always have a easy time with that

601
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,354
那将是四个所以我们剩下12个
that would be four so we got 12 left to

602
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,915
分享出来，所以6个莫名其妙六六角度
share out so six somehow six six angles

603
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,505
在四个方面，我们留下它
in four dimensions well we leave it

604
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,304
在那里，是的，是的，好的，好吧
there yeah yeah yeah okay okay so

605
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:26,864
有SVD但没有例子
there's the SVD but without an example

606
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:29,665
你知道我必须要做的例子
examples you know I would have to

607
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,544
计算一个转置a并找到它
compute a transpose a and find it so the

608
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:35,665
文本将这样做会为一
text will do that does it for a

609
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,115
特别是矩阵哦
particular matrix Oh

610
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,275
是的，文本是为矩阵做的
yeah the text does it for a for a matrix

611
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,365
三四零五出来了
three four zero five that came out

612
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,325
很好啊，我们可以做的一些事实
pretty well uh a few facts we could

613
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,625
尽管如此，如果我倍增所有
learn though so the if I multiply all

614
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,115
特征值一起然后我一个
the eigenvalues together then I for a

615
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,475
矩阵A我会得到什么，我得到了
matrix a what do I get I get the

616
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,345
行列式
determinant

617
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,735
如果我乘以奇异值怎么办？
what if I multiply the singular values

618
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,565
一起
together

619
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,695
再一次，我得到了你能做到的决定因素
well again I get the determinant you can

620
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,355
看到它的大公式马上
see it right away from the big formula

621
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,125
把决定因素当作决定因素
take determinant take determinants well

622
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,495
假设矩阵a是正方形，那么它就是
assuming the matrix a is square so it's

623
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,445
有一个决定因素，然后我采取
got a determinant then I take

624
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,335
决定因素的决定因素
determinants the determinant of this

625
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,345
产品我可以分开
product I can take the separate

626
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,165
具有决定因素的决定因素
determinants that has determinant equal

627
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:36,835
一个正交矩阵
to one an orthogonal matrix the the the

628
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,355
行列式是1，类似于此
determinant is 1 and similarly here so

629
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,955
所以Sigma的产品也是
so the product of the Sigma's is also

630
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,255
决定因素是啊是的所以产品
the determinant yeah yeah so the product

631
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,295
Sigma的定义也是确定的
of the Sigma's is also the determinate

632
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,335
西格玛的产品将在这里
the product of the Sigma's here will be

633
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,045
15但你会发现Sigma1是
15 but you'll find that Sigma 1 is

634
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,545
小于lambda1所以这里是
smaller than lambda 1 so here are the

635
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,125
特征值lambda1小于等于
eigen values lambda 1 lesser equal

636
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:08,405
lambda2说但是奇异的价值观
lambda 2 say but but the singular values

637
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:13,385
在他们之外是的，但他们仍然
are outside them yeah but they still

638
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,865
将Sigma1乘以Sigma2
multiply Sigma 1 thing times Sigma 2

639
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,795
仍然是15，那是相同的
will still be 15 and that's the same as

640
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,785
lambda1次lambda2yep但总体而言
lambda 1 times lambda 2 yep but overall

641
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:31,685
计算SVD的例子
computing the examples of the of the SVD

642
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,515
花更多的时间，因为你是的
take more time because well yeah you

643
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,305
只计算一个转置a和你
just compute a transpose a and you've

644
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,305
得到了V，你就在路上
got the V's and you're on your way and

645
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:45,275
你必须采取平方根
you have to take the square roots of the

646
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,145
参数使得SVD成为一个
argument so that's the SVD as a

647
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,745
一块纯数学但当然是什么
piece of pure math but of course what

648
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,025
我们会做下一次启动的时候了
we'll do next time starting right away

649
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,075
正在使用SVD，让我告诉你，即使
is use SVD and let me tell you even

650
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,415
今天最重要的是，是的，最重要的
today the most yeah yeah most important

651
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,725
SVD的各个部分，我的意思是什么
pieces of the SVD so what do I mean by

652
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,815
SVD的各个部分我还有一个
pieces of the SVD I've got one more

653
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,885
黑板仍然是正确的，所以我们在这里
blackboard still the right on so here we

654
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,035
走
go

655
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:27,085
所以让我写出一个是你的用途
so let me write out a is you the use

656
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:33,635
西格玛Σ的1倍到R倍
times the Sigma's Sigma's 1 to R times

657
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,535
B的V转置V1向下移调
the B's V transpose V 1 transpose down

658
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:42,385
到VR转置所以那些是跨越的
to V R transpose so those are across

659
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:51,955
是的，实际上我在这里写的是这样的
yeah actually what I've written here so

660
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,505
那里你可以说有一个大的
there you could say there's a large big

661
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,325
经济有一个较小的经济体
economies there's a there's a smaller

662
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,235
尺寸SVD，有真正的东西
size SVD that has the real stuff that

663
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,875
真的很重要，然后有更大的
really counts and then there's a larger

664
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,325
SVD有很多零如此
SVD that has a whole lot of zeroes so so

665
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:12,325
这将是较小的一个M乘R或
this would be the smaller one M by R or

666
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,055
这将是RbyR，这些都是
this would be R by R and these would all

667
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:24,335
是积极的，这将是Rbynso
be positive and this would be R by n so

668
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,595
那是唯一使用的是非
that's the that's only using the are non

669
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,115
所有这些人都大于零
zeros all these guys are greater than

670
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:36,365
零，然后我们可以填补另一个
zero then the other one we could fill

671
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:44,345
得到正方形正交矩阵
out to get square orthogonal matrix the

672
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,205
Sigma和V的V1转换为
Sigma's and square V's V 1 transpose to

673
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,805
是和转置所以形状是什么
be and transpose so what are the shapes

674
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:57,725
现在这个形状是MbyM它是合适的
now this shape is M by M it's a proper

675
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,025
正交矩阵这个也是n乘n
orthogonal matrix this one also n by n

676
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,935
所以这家伙是这是适马
so this guy has to be this is the Sigma

677
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,795
现在所以它必须是什么
now so it has to be what

678
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,205
叹息M由n表示剩下的空间
sighs M by n that's the remaining space

679
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,605
所以它从Sigma的开始
so it starts with the Sigma's

680
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:18,065
然后这一切都为零占
and then it's all zeros accounting for

681
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:24,635
nullspacestuff是的你应该这样做
null space stuff yeah so you should

682
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,015
真的看到这两个是可能的
really see that these two are possible

683
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,115
当你这一切都是零
that that all these zeros when you

684
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,735
多出来就是什么都没有
multiply out just give nothing so that

685
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,525
真的是非零的唯一的东西
really the only thing that non zero is

686
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:42,785
在这些位中，但有一个完整的
in these bits but there's a complete one

687
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:46,085
那么这些额外的用途是什么呢？
so what are these extra use they're in

688
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,295
转置的零空间a
the null space of a transpose a

689
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,565
转置或转置是的两个
transpose or a transpose a yeah so two

690
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,465
尺寸大尺寸和小尺寸
sizes the large size and the small size

691
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,185
但他们就是重要的事情
but they're then the things that count

692
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:07,715
都在那里好，所以我要去
are all in there okay so I was going to

693
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,325
做一件事，我让我看看
do one more thing and I'm let me see

694
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:17,795
这是什么，所以这是
what what it was there so this is

695
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,785
你会看到说明的第1.8节
section 1.8 of the notes and you'll see

696
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:28,745
那里的例子，你会看到第二个
examples there and you'll see a second

697
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,755
找到叶子和B的方法
approach to the finding leaves and B's

698
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,685
和Sigma我可以告诉你那是什么
and Sigma's I can tell you what that is

699
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:44,675
但也许只有两个只是做
but maybe with just two just to do

700
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:50,075
最后一件好事告诉我
something nice at the end let me tell

701
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,265
你关于a的另一个因素分解
you about another factorization of a

702
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,965
这是着名的着名的
that was famous that's famous in

703
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:05,995
工程，它在中国很有名
engineering and it's famous in in

704
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,975
几何，所以这是一个你的西格玛V
geometry so this is any a as a u Sigma V

705
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,125
转置我们现在已经有了
transpose we've got that now the the the

706
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,495
我正在考虑的另一个我会说的
other one that I'm thinking of I'll tell

707
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,445
你的名字，它被称为极点
you its name it's called the pole

708
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:27,995
矩阵的分解和我想要的一切
decomposition of a matrix and all I want

709
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,395
你要看到它是虚拟的
you to see is that it's it's virtually

710
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,765
在这里，极地意味着什么是极地和
here so a polar means what's polar and

711
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,455
对于复数，什么是极性形式
for complex number what's the polar form

712
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:47,165
一个复杂的数字真正的家伙
of a complex number a real guy

713
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,045
所以真正的家伙R将翻译成一个
so the real guy R will translate into a

714
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,465
对称的家伙和我对thethethethe
symmetric guy and the e to the I theta

715
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:58,715
将翻译成他所说的话
will translate into so what does he say

716
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,655
什么样的矩阵让你想起e
what kind of a matrix reminds you of e

717
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:06,815
在我THETA还是遗憾尺寸之一，所以
to the I theta or sorry size one so

718
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:12,425
正交所以这是一个非常非常使用
orthogonal so that's a very using very

719
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:17,065
各种矩阵因素都很好
kind of nice every matrix factors into

720
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,595
对称矩阵乘以正交
symmetric matrix times an orthogonal

721
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,545
矩阵和我当然将这些描述为
matrix and I of course describe these as

722
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,275
最重要的矩阵类
the most important classes of matrices

723
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,085
在这里我们说每个矩阵都是一个
and here we're saying every matrix is a

724
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:34,685
s次aq我也说我
s times aq and I'm also saying that I

725
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,415
可以迅速摆脱出局
can get that quickly out of out of the

726
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,535
SVD所以我只想这样做，所以我想要
SVD so I'm just want to do it so I want

727
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,285
找到一个S并找到一个这样的Q.
to find an S and find a Q out of this so

728
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,055
得到一个S所以让我开始吧
to get an S so let me just start it you

729
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:55,475
西格玛，但现在我正在寻找一个S.
Sigma but now I'm looking for an S so

730
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,425
我现在该怎么做呢
what shall I take put in now

731
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,564
我把一个更好的投入，如果我有你
I put a better put in if I've got you

732
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,695
西格玛的东西，我想要它
Sigma something and I want it to be

733
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,765
对称我不应该放在你身上
symmetric I shouldn't put in you

734
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,574
转置会做，但如果我放
transpose will do it but then if I put

735
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,574
在你的转调我必须把你这么做
in u transpose I've got to put in you so

736
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:21,925
现在我有你的Sigmau转置U是
now I've got you Sigma u transpose U is

737
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,455
现在的身份我必须得到V.
the identity now I've got to get V

738
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:29,395
转置，我得到了极地
transpose and have I got what the polar

739
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,215
在这一行中要求分解
decomposition is asking for in this line

740
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,364
所以是的，我觉得我在这里得到了什么
so yeah I think what do I got here

741
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:41,635
哪里是S的地方，所以这样
where's the where's the S and this so

742
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,005
你看我接受了SVD而我只是放了
you see I took the SVD and I just put

743
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,245
那里的身份刚刚转移
the identity in there just shifted

744
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,435
事情有点现在在哪里
things a little and now where's the s

745
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,854
我可以直接读一读
that I can read off for a straight

746
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:59,604
这是一个对称矩阵的S.
that's an S that's a symmetric matrix

747
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:03,745
Q我认为我们可以在哪里
and where's the Q well I guess we can

748
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:10,155
看看Q必须在哪里，是的
see where the Q has to be it's here yeah

749
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,985
是的，只要坚持你转移你
yeah so just by sticking u transpose U

750
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,265
并查找和括起括号
and looking and putting the parentheses

751
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:21,145
对，我恢复那个分解
right what I recover that decomposition

752
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:25,735
在机械中的矩阵
of a matrix which in in mechanical

753
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,405
工程语言语言告诉我
engineering languages language tells me

754
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,844
任何一个应变都可以让你知道哪个
that any strain can be you know which is

755
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:35,844
喜欢拉伸弹性的东西
like stretching of a of elastic thing

756
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:44,875
有一种对称的伸展
has a has a symmetric kind of a stretch

757
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:51,265
和内部扭曲是的，所以这是好的
and internal twist yeah so that's good

758
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,745
那么这很多是三六九
well this was a lot of three six nine

759
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:00,945
它充满了矩阵
boards filled with matrices well it is

760
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:06,915
1806五，所以也许没关系
1806 five so maybe that's all right but

761
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,465
我们的想法是在矩阵上使用它们
the idea is to use them on a matrix of

762
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,545
数据和
data and

763
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,565
我只会告诉你钥匙的关键事实
I'll just tell you the key fact the key

764
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:26,185
事实上，如果我有一个很大的数据矩阵嘿
fact if I have a big matrix of data Hey

765
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,315
如果我想退出那个矩阵
and if I want to pull out of that matrix

766
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,995
这个重要的部分是什么数据
the important part so that's what data

767
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,965
科学必须做大做事
science has to be doing out of a big

768
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:40,505
矩阵中的一部分是其中的一部分
matrix some of those some part of it is

769
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:43,505
噪音的一部分是信号我
noise some part of it is signal I'm

770
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,455
寻找最重要的部分
looking for the most important part of

771
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,585
这里的信号，所以我在寻找
the signal here so I'm looking for the

772
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:52,805
a中矩阵最重要的部分
most important part of the matrix in a

773
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,715
最大的数字，但是那个和那个
way the biggest numbers but but that and

774
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,935
我当然看看个别数字
of course I'm look at individual numbers

775
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,885
那么矩阵中最重要的部分是什么
so what's the biggest part of the matrix

776
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,095
什么是校长
what's the what are the principal

777
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,675
组件现在我们真的进入了
components now we're really getting in

778
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,005
如果这是一个如果你知道它可以
if this is a if this you know it could

779
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,885
是数据，我们想做统计数据
be data and we want to do statistics so

780
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:17,195
我们希望看到什么是高点
we want to see what's what has high

781
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,175
方差我们的方差很小
variance what has low variance we'll

782
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,115
我们将与之建立联系
we'll do these connections with

783
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,075
统计数据，但重要的是什么
statistics but what's the important part

784
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,645
矩阵井的意思是看
of the matrix well that means look at

785
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,145
在你西格玛V移调这里啊，让
the you Sigma V transpose here yeah let

786
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,855
我看看有啥一个最
me look at it so what's the one most

787
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,505
该矩阵的重要组成部分
important part of that of that matrix

788
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:46,445
一个是正​​确的，它是一个等级P所以
one the right one it's a rank one P so

789
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,995
当我说一部分时，我当然是
when I say a part I'm of course it's

790
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,095
将成为一个矩阵部分，但所以
going to be a matrix part but so the

791
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,195
简单的矩阵构建块就像一个
simple matrix building block is like a

792
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,345
排名一个矩阵什么东西
rank one matrix something something

793
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:59,345
调换，我应该拉出来
transpose and what should I pull out of

794
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:02,465
这是最重要的排名
that as being the most important rank

795
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,545
这个产品就是一个矩阵
one matrix that's in that product so

796
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,735
在你的时候我会把它擦掉一点八
I'll erase it one point eight while you

797
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,975
想想我该怎么做
think what do I do

798
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,905
把事情搞清楚了
to pick out the big deal the the thing

799
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,325
数据首先告诉我
that the data is telling me first well

800
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,615
这些是
these are

801
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,275
在正常的北方我不能没有人更大
north of normal I can no one is bigger

802
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,375
这些都是正交的
than another one these are orthonormal

803
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,095
没有人比另一个更大但是
no one is bigger than another one but

804
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,865
我在这里看看哪个是最多的
here I look here which is the most

805
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:38,205
重要数字Sigma1Sigma1所以
important number Sigma 1 Sigma 1 so the

806
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,605
我挑选的部分是这个最大的数字
part I pick out is this biggest number

807
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:46,065
它的Rho倍于它的列，所以它就是你
times its Rho times its column so it's u

808
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:53,175
1Sigma1V1转置是顶部
1 Sigma 1 V 1 transpose is the the top

809
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,805
矩阵的主要部分是它
principal part of the matrix a it's the

810
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,845
矩阵的前导部分是它的
leading part of the matrix a it's the

811
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,055
排名第一的是最大排名的一部分
rank one the biggest rank one part of

812
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,115
矩阵在那里计算那些
the matrix is there so computing those

813
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,785
三个家伙是迈出的第一步
three guys is the first step to

814
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,995
了解数据是的，所以
understanding the data yeah so that's

815
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,545
接下来会发生什么，我猜
what's coming next is and I guess

816
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:17,535
明天，因为他们周一搬了我的
tomorrow since they moved Monday my

817
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:22,745
教会周二宣布为星期一
teach declared Tuesday to be Monday

818
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,055
他们周三没有改变
there they didn't change Wednesday so

819
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,490
I'll see you tomorrow for the the

820
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:33,850
我会看到你明天的中

821
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,850
主要成分
principal components
